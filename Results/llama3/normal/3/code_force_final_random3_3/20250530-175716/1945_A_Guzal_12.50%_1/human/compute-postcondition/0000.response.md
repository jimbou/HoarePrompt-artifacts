The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). The first input is an integer `t`, which is assigned to `n`. The remaining inputs are `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^4), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**
