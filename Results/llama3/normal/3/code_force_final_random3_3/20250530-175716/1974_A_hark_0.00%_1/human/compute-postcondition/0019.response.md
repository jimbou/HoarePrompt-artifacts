Functionality: **This function takes two integers x and y as input, where x and y are between 0 and 99. It then performs different calculations based on the values of x and y. If both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates the sum of the ceiling of y divided by 2 and the ceiling of x divided by 15, and prints the result. If x is 0 and y is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is greater than 0 and y is 0, it prints the ceiling of x divided by 15. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function returns the calculated value as an integer between 1 and 57, or 0 if both x and y are 0.**
