Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop, given the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` is not relevant to the problem, as it simply compares two integers and returns the smaller one.

`func_2` takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It performs calculations based on the values of `x` and `y` to determine the minimum number of screens needed. The calculations seem to be correct, as they take into account the size of the icons and the available space on each screen.

`func_3` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and calls `func_2` that many times. This suggests that the program is designed to handle multiple test cases.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case, and `func_3` correctly handles multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and all its functions together are correct.

Correctness: **True**
