Output State: **`_` is `t-1`, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, and the function `func_2()` has been called and executed `t` times, but its return value is unknown.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable `_` will have a value one less than the initial value of `t`, and the function `func_2()` will have been called and executed a total of `t` times. The value of `t` itself remains unchanged, within the range of 1 to 10^4.
