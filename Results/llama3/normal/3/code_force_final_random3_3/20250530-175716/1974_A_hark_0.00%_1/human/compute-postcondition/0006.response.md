Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the function `func_2()` has been called and executed, but its return value is unknown.**

The code snippet provided is simply a function call to `func_2()`. Since the function has already been called and executed, its return value is unknown. The values of the variables `t` and `_` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain the same. The output state is the same as the initial state.
