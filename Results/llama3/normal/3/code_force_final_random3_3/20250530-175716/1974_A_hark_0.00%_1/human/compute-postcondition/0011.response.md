The code prints the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15.
Since `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, and the current value of `x` is greater than 0, the value of `x` will be between 1 and 99.
The `math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer not less than the given number.
Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer not less than `x` divided by 15.
Output: **the smallest integer not less than x divided by 15 (where x is an integer between 1 and 99)**
