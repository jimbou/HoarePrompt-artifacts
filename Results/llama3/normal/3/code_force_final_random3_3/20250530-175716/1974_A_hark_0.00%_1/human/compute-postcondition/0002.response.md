Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, and the function `func_2()` has been called and executed, but its return value is unknown.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The code snippet calls the function `func_2()`, which is executed, but its return value is not assigned to any variable, so it is unknown. The stdin remains empty, as there is no input operation in the code snippet.
