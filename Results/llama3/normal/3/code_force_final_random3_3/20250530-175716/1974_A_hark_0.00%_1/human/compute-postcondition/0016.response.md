Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both are 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of x divided by 15 is being printed. Otherwise, 0 is being printed.***
