Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Example

    2 0
    
    15 0
    
    8 2
    
    0 9

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers.
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller of the two non-negative integers a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function compares two non-negative integers, a and b, and returns the smaller of the two.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: a value between 1 and 57 (which is the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: the ceiling of the division of y by 2 (where y is an integer between 0 and 99 and the current value of y is greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: the smallest integer not less than x divided by 15 (where x is an integer between 1 and 99)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both are 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of x divided by 15 is being printed. Otherwise, 0 is being printed.
        #State: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both are 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of half of the value of `y` is being printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of x divided by 15 is being printed. Otherwise, 0 is being printed.
    #State: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed, where the sum is an integer between 1 and 57. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of half of the value of `y` is being printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of x divided by 15 is being printed. Otherwise, 0 is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers x and y as input, where x and y are between 0 and 99. It then performs different calculations based on the values of x and y. If both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates the sum of the ceiling of y divided by 2 and the ceiling of x divided by 15, and prints the result. If x is 0 and y is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is greater than 0 and y is 0, it prints the ceiling of x divided by 15. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function returns the calculated value as an integer between 1 and 57, or 0 if both x and y are 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (t) that is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^4.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: `_` is `t-1`, `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, and the function `func_2()` has been called and executed `t` times, but its return value is unknown.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer from standard input and calls the function `func_2()` that many times.
