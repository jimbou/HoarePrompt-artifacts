Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and then t-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99). If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed, where the sum is an integer between 1 and 57. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of half of the value of `y` is being printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of x divided by 15 is being printed. Otherwise, 0 is being printed.***
