Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the function `func_2()` has been called and executed, but its return value is unknown.**

The code snippet is simply a function call to `func_2()`, which has already been called and executed. Since the return value of `func_2()` is unknown, we cannot determine any changes to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
