To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `paths`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `paths`. If `paths` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is no longer less than the length of `pathb` or `k` is less than `i + 1`. So for the loop to be executed, `paths` must have at least 1 element and `i` is 0.

State: **The loop finishes execution when i is no longer less than the length of pathb or k is less than i + 1. At this point, curr is the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i], and resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. All other variables retain their original values and relationships, paths is a list that must have at least 1 element, i is 0**
