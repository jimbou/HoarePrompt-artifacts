Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `ps - 1`, `pathb` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, and the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the (`ps-1`)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is equal to the length of `paths + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
