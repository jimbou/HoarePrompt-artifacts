Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value of `a` at index `pb - 1` and the second element is the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` values where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
