Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1, the value of a at index pb - 1, the value of a at index pb - 1, and the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the (ps-1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1**
