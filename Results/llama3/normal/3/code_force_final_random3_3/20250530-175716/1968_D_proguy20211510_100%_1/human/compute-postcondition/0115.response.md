Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `pathb` is a list with length greater than an integer plus 1, `paths` is an integer, `vis` is an integer, `curr` is an integer, `preb` is an integer, `resb` is an integer, `i` is an integer plus 2, `ress` is an integer, `pres` is an integer and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program execution will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
