Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is an integer equal to the value of p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is a list containing the value of a[ps - 1], vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1. If vis[ps - 1] is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is the value of p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is a list containing the value of a[ps - 1] and a[p[ps - 1] - 1], vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1. If vis[ps - 1] is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is the value of p[p[ps - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is a list containing the value of a[ps - 1], a[p[ps - 1] - 1], and a[ps - 1], vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1. If vis[ps - 1] is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
