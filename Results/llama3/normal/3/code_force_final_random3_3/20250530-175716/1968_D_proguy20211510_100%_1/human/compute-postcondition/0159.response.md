Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are the value of `a` at index `pb - 1` and the third element is the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` values where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`. If the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
