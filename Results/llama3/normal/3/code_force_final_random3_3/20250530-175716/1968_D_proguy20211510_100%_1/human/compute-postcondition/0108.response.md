Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, `preb` are integers or lists of integers. If `k` is less than `i` + 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without any changes to the variables.***
