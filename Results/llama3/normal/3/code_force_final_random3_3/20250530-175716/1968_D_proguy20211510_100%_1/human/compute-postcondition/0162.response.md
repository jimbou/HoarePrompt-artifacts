Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the values of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1**
