Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1.**

The code initializes the list `vis` with `n` zeros, then sets the element at index `ps - 1` to 1. This means that all elements in `vis` are now 0 except for the element at index `ps - 1`, which is 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
