Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the (pb-1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1, and k is less than i + 1. If resb is greater than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If resb is less than or equal to ress, 'Sasha' is printed if ress is greater than resb, otherwise 'Draw' is printed.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the (pb-1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1, and k is less than i + 1. If vis[pb - 1] is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `p[pb - 1] - 1`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `pb - 1` and the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the (`pb-1`)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` + 1, and if the (`pb-1`)th element of `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is the value of p at index p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1, the value of a at index pb - 1, and the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the (pb-1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1. If vis[pb - 1] is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
