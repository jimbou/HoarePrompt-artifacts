Output State: **The loop has finished execution, and at this point, the current value of k is less than i + 1. The current value of curr is the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i. The current value of preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i]. The current value of resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. All other variables retain their original values and relationships. paths is a list that must have at least 1 element, and i is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The loop has finished execution, and the current values of k, curr, preb, and resb are maintained. The value of k is still less than i + 1. The value of curr is still the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i. The value of preb is still incremented by the value of pathb[i]. The value of resb is still the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. All other variables retain their original values and relationships. The list paths still has at least 1 element, and the value of i is still 0. Additionally, we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
