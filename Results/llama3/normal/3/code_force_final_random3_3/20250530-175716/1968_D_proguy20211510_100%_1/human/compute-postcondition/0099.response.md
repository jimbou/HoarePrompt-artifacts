Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will continue to execute indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `pathb` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `pb - 1` four times, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1` twice, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the `(p[ps - 1] - 1)`th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `a[ps - 1]` and the difference between `k` and the length of `paths`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `a[ps - 1]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` + 1**
