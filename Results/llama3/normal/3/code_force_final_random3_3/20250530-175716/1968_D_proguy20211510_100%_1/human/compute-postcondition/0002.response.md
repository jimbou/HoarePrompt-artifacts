Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input, _ is 0**

Here's a description of the final state:

The code reads four space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables n, k, pb, and ps. It then reads two lines of input, each containing a list of integers, and assigns them to the variables p and a. The variables pathb and paths are initialized as empty lists. The variable vis is initialized as a list of n zeros, with the pb-1th element set to 1. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input. The values of YES, NO, MOD, alpha, and _ remain unchanged.
