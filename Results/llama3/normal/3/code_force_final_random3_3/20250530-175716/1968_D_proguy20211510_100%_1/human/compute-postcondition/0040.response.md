Postcondition: ***`curr` is the sum of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `preb` is incremented by the value of `pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
