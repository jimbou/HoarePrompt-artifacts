Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a single element which is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values where the element at index pb - 1 is 1 and all other elements are 0, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1. If the element at index pb - 1 in vis is 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
