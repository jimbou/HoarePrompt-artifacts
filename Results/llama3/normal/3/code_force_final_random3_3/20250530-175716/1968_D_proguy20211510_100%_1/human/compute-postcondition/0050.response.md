Postcondition: ***The loop finishes execution when i is no longer less than the length of pathb or k is less than i + 1. At this point, curr is the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i], and resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. All other variables retain their original values and relationships, paths is a list that must have at least 1 element, i is 0. If k is less than i + 1, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
