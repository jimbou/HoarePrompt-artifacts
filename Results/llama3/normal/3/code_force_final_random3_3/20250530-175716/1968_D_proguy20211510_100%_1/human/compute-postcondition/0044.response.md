Postcondition: ***`curr` is the sum of the original value of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i+1]` and the difference between `k` and `i+1`, `preb` is incremented by the value of `pathb[i+1]`, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.***
