Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is the value of p at index p[ps - 1] - 1, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1 four times, paths is a list of at least 1 integer, vis is a list of n integers with the (p[ps - 1] - 1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of a[ps - 1] and the difference between k and the length of paths, pres is incremented by the value of a[ps - 1], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths, resb is the maximum of its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i, preb is the sum of the values in pathb, and resb is less than or equal to ress. The current value of ress is greater than the current value of resb.***
