To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pathb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pathb`. If `pathb` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `i` is equal to the length of `paths` + 1, we can adjust `i` to be 1 and `pathb` to have at least 1 element.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1` `n` times, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the (`p[ps - 1] - 1`)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `a[ps - 1]` and the difference between `k` and the length of `paths`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `a[ps - 1]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is 1, `resb` is 0, `preb` is 0**
