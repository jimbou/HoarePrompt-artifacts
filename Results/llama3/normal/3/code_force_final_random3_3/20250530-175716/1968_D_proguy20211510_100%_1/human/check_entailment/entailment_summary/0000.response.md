Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the game between Bodya and Sasha by calculating their scores based on the permutation and array provided. It correctly handles multiple test cases, reads input from stdin, and prints the results directly.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly identifies the winner by comparing the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha. The use of variables and data structures, such as lists and arrays, is appropriate for the problem. The program also handles edge cases, such as when the game duration `k` is less than the length of the path, by breaking out of the loop.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, iterating over multiple test cases, reading input, and printing the results correctly.

Correctness: **True**
