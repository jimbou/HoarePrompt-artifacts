Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is the value of p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is a list containing the value of a[ps - 1] and a[p[ps - 1] - 1], vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
