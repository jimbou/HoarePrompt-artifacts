Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the (`pb-1`)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` + 1, and `k` is less than `i` + 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their original values, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement due to the `break` statement. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the innermost loop or if statement, which may affect the control flow of the program.
