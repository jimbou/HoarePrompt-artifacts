Postcondition: **The loop has finished execution, and at this point, the current value of k is less than i + 1. The current value of curr is the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i. The current value of preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i]. The current value of resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. All other variables retain their original values and relationships. paths is a list that must have at least 1 element, and i is 0.**
