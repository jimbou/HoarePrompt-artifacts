Postcondition: ***YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is the value of p[ps - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is a list containing the value of a[ps - 1] and a[p[ps - 1] - 1], vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1. If vis[ps - 1] is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
