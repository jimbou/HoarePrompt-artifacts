Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value of a at index pb - 1 and the second element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values where the element at index pb - 1 is 1 and all other elements are 0, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1. If the element at index pb - 1 in vis is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
