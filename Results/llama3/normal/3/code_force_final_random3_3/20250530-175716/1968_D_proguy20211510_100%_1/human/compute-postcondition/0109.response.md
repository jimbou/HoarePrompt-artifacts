Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `curr` is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i`, `preb` is an integer equal to its original value plus `pathb[i]`, `resb` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `curr`, `i` is an integer, `resb` is an integer, `preb` is an integer, `ress` is an integer, `pres` is an integer.**

The code block modifies the values of `curr`, `preb`, and `resb`. The first line calculates the value of `curr` by adding the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i` to `preb`. The second line increments `preb` by `pathb[i]`. The third line updates `resb` to be the maximum of its original value and `curr`. The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `i`, `ress`, and `pres` remain unchanged.
