Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is the value of p at index p[ps - 1] - 1, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1 four times, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1 n times, vis is a list of n integers with the (p[ps - 1] - 1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of a[ps - 1] and the difference between k and the length of paths, pres is incremented by the value of a[ps - 1], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1, resb is 0, preb is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `curr` is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i`, `preb` is an integer equal to its original value plus `pathb[i]`, `resb` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `curr`, `i` is an integer, `resb` is an integer, `preb` is an integer, `ress` is an integer, `pres` is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, p is an integer, a is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, pathb is an integer, paths is an integer, vis is an integer, curr is an integer equal to the original value of preb plus the product of pathb[i] and k - i, preb is an integer equal to the original value plus pathb[i], resb is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and curr, i is an integer plus 1, ress is an integer, pres is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, k, p, a, pb, ps, paths, vis, i, ress, pres are integers. curr is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of pathb[i] and (k - i) plus preb. preb is an integer equal to its original value plus pathb[i]. resb is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and curr.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
