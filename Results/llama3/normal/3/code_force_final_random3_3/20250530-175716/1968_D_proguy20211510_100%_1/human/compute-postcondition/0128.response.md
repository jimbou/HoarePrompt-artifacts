The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `paths`. If `i` is less than the length of `paths`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, but it is less than the length of `paths`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, and `preb` remain unchanged, `curr` is `pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1))`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i+1]`, and `ress` is the maximum of its original value and `pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1))**, `i` is `i+1`.
