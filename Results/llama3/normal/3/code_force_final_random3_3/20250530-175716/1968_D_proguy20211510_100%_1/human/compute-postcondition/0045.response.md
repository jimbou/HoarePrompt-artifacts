Output State: **curr is the sum of the original value of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i], resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr.**

In this final state, the value of curr is calculated by adding the original value of preb to the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i. The value of preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i]. The value of resb is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. The values of k and i remain unchanged.
