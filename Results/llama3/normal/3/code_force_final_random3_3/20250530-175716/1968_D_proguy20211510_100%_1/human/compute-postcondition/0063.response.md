Output: **curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths, and k is less than i + 1. The current value of resb is higher than the current value of ress, and 'Bodya' is printed**
