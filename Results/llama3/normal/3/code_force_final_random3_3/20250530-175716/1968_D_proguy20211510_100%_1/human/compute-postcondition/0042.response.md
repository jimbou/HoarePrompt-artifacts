State: **`curr` is the sum of the original value of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i+1]` and the difference between `k` and `i+1`, `preb` is incremented by the value of `pathb[i+1]`, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is `i+1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `i + 2`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged**
