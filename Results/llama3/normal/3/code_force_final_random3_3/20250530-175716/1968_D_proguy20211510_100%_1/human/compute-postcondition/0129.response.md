Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, and `preb` remain unchanged, `curr` is `pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1))`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i+1]`, and `ress` is the maximum of its original value and `pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables except `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` retain their original values. The values of `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` are updated based on the given expressions. Additionally, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
