To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pathb`. The loop will execute if `pathb` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `pathb` to have at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing at least one element where each element is the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1`, the value of `a` at index `ps - 1`, the value of `a` at index `p[ps - 1] - 1`, and the value of `a` at index `p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1`, `vis` is a list of `n` values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1, the element at index `p[ps - 1] - 1` which is 1, and the element at index `p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1` which is 1, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0**
