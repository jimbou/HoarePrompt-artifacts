Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is the value of p at index p[ps - 1] - 1, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1 four times, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1 n times, vis is a list of n integers with the (p[ps - 1] - 1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of a[ps - 1] and the difference between k and the length of paths, pres is incremented by the value of a[ps - 1], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of pathb, resb is the maximum of its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i, preb is the sum of the values in pathb.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is the value of p at index p[ps - 1] - 1, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1 four times, paths is a list of at least 1 integer, vis is a list of n integers with the (p[ps - 1] - 1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of a[ps - 1] and the difference between k and the length of paths, pres is incremented by the value of a[ps - 1], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is 0, resb is the maximum of its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i, preb is the sum of the values in pathb.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `i`, `resb`, and `preb` remain unchanged, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, and `ress` is the maximum of its original value and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, k, p, a, pb, ps, pathb, paths, vis, resb, and preb remain unchanged. If k is less than i + 1, then curr is pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1)), pres is pres + paths[i+1], and ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1)). Otherwise, curr is pres + paths[i] * (k - i), pres is pres + paths[i], and ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
