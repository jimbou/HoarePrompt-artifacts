Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is the value of p at index p[pb - 1] - 1, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1 and the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the (pb-1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1, and k is less than i + 1.**

In this final state, the value of `pb` has been updated to the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`, and the list `pathb` now contains two elements: the original value of `a` at index `pb - 1` and the new value of `a` at index `pb - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
