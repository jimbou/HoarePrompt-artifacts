Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the (pb-1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1, and k is less than i + 1. If resb is greater than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If resb is less than or equal to ress, 'Sasha' is printed if ress is greater than resb, otherwise 'Draw' is printed.**
