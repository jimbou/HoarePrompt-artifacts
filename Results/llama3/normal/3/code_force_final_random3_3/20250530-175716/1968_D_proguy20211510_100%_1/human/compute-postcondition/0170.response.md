Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing elements where each element is the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1` and the value of `a` at index `ps - 1`, `vis` is a list of `n` values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`. If the element at index `ps - 1` in `vis` is 1, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
