Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index ps - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1**

The code appends the value of `a` at index `ps - 1` to the list `paths`, and then updates the value of `ps` to be the value of `p` at index `ps - 1`. This means that `ps` now points to a new index in the list `p`, and the list `paths` contains the value of `a` at the previous index `ps - 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
