To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `paths`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `paths`. If `i` is less than the length of `paths`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` minus 1 (since the loop iterates over the indices of `paths`). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the length of `paths` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `paths` must have a length greater than the new value of `i`**
