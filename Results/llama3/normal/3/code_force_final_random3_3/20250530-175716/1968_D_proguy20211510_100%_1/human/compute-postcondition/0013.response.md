Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[p[pb - 1] - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[p[pb - 1]], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1.**

The code modifies the values of `pb` and `pathb`. The first line appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to `pathb`, adding a new element to the list. The second line updates the value of `pb` to be `p[pb - 1]`, which is the value of the element at index `pb - 1` in the list `p`. This change affects the value of `pb`, making it equal to the value of `p[p[pb - 1] - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
