Postcondition: ***curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths, and k is less than i + 1. Additionally, resb is less than or equal to ress. The current value of ress is higher than the current value of resb.***
