Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index ps - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1. If vis[ps - 1] is 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made.***
