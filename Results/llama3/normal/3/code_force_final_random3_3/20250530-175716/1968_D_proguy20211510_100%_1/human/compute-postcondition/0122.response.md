Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `pathb` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `pb - 1` four times, `paths` is a list of at least 1 integer, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the `(p[ps - 1] - 1)`th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `a[ps - 1]` and the difference between `k` and the length of `paths`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `a[ps - 1]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is 0, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the sum of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i`, `preb` is the sum of the values in `pathb`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `preb`.***
