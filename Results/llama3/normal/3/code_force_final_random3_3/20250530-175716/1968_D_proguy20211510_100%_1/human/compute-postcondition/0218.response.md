Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores calculated by traversing a permutation and an array. It iterates over multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines of input, and prints the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case. The function takes no explicit parameters but reads input from stdin and returns no value, instead printing the results directly.**
