Postcondition: ***`curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `paths` must have a length greater than the new value of `i`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
