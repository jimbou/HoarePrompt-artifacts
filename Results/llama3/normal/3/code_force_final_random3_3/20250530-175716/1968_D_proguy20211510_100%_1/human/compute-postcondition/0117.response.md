Output State: **n, k, p, a, pb, ps, paths, vis, i, ress, pres are integers. curr is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of pathb[i] and (k - i) plus preb. preb is an integer equal to its original value plus pathb[i]. resb is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and curr.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `paths`, `vis`, `i`, `ress`, and `pres` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `curr` is updated by adding the product of `pathb[i]` and `(k - i)` to its original value, and then adding `preb`. The value of `preb` is incremented by `pathb[i]`. Finally, the value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`.
