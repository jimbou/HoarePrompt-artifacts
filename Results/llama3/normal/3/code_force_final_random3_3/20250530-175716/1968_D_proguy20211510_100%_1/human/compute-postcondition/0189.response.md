Output State: **`n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `pb`, `resb`, `preb`, and `i` retain their original values as described in the precondition. `curr` is set to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is incremented by `pathb[i]`, and `resb` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and `curr`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `pb`, `i` remain unchanged from their original values as described in the precondition. The variable `curr` is assigned a new value based on the calculation `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, which depends on the values of `preb`, `pathb[i]`, `k`, and `i`. The value of `preb` is then incremented by `pathb[i]`. Finally, the value of `resb` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and the newly calculated `curr`.
