Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1**
