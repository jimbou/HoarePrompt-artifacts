Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is the value of p at index p[ps - 1] - 1, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1 four times, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1 n times, vis is a list of n integers with the (p[ps - 1] - 1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of a[ps - 1] and the difference between k and the length of paths, pres is incremented by the value of a[ps - 1], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of pathb, resb is the maximum of its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i, preb is the sum of the values in pathb.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The variables n, k, p, a, pb, ps, paths, vis, curr, pres, and ress remain unchanged. The variable i is now equal to the length of pathb, which is 4. The variable resb is now the maximum of its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i. The variable preb is now the sum of the values in pathb.
