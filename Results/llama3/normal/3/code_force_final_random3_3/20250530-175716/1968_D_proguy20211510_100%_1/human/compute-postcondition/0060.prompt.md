Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop finishes execution when i is no longer less than the length of pathb or k is less than i + 1. At this point, curr is the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i], and resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. All other variables retain their original values and relationships.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], and ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is incremented by 1, and paths must have a length greater than the new value of i. If k is less than i + 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
