Output State: **curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is incremented by 1, and paths must have a length greater than the new value of i. If k is less than i + 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` is updated to be the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`. The value of `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`. The value of `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The length of `paths` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.
