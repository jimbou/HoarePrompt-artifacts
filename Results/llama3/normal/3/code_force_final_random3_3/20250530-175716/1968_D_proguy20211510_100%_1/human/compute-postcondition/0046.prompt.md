Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is the value of p[p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is a list containing the value of a[ps - 1], a[p[ps - 1] - 1], a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1], and a[p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1], vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1, resb is 0, ress is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program continues execution with updated values for curr, preb, and resb. curr is now equal to the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i. preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i]. resb is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. All other variables retain their original values and relationships.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: curr is the sum of the original value of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i], resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to i + 1, otherwise i remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: curr is the sum of the original value of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i], resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
