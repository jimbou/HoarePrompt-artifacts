Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `curr` is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i`, `preb` is an integer equal to its original value plus `pathb[i]`, `resb` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `curr`, `i` is an integer plus 1, `resb` is an integer, `preb` is an integer, `ress` is an integer, `pres` is an integer. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
