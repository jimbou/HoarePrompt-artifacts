Output State: **n, k, p, a, pb, ps, pathb, paths, vis, resb, and preb remain unchanged. If k is less than i + 1, then curr is pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1)), pres is pres + paths[i+1], and ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1)). Otherwise, curr is pres + paths[i] * (k - i), pres is pres + paths[i], and ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, and `preb` remain unchanged from their initial state. The values of `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` are updated based on the comparison between `k` and `i + 1`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the values of `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` are updated using the expressions `pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1))`, `pres + paths[i+1]`, and the maximum of the original value of `ress` and `pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1))`, respectively. Otherwise, the values of `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` are updated using the expressions `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres + paths[i]`, and the maximum of the original value of `ress` and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, respectively.
