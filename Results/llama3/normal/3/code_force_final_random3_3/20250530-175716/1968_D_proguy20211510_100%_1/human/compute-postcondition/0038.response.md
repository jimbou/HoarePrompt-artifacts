To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pathb`. 

Since `i` is the loop counter, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. 

The state of `pathb` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop counter `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`curr` is the sum of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `preb` is incremented by the value of `pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is incremented by 1, all other variables retain their original values and relationships.**

Note that the state of `pathb` is not explicitly mentioned, as it is not modified by the loop counter `i`.
