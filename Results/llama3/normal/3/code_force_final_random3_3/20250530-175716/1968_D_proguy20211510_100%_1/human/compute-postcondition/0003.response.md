Since the `while` loop statement is `while True`, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input, _ is 0**
