Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index p[ps - 1] - 1, and the value of a at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, the element at index p[ps - 1] - 1 which is 1, and the element at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i for all i in range(len(pathb)) where k >= i + 1, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i] for all i in range(len(pathb)) where k >= i + 1, pres is the sum of its original value and paths[i] for all i in range(len(paths)) where k >= i + 1, ress is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and k - i for all i in range(len(paths)) where k >= i + 1, i is the length of paths if k is greater than or equal to the length of paths, otherwise i is the value that caused the break.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `pb`, `resb`, and `preb` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `pres` is updated to be the sum of its original value and `paths[i]` for all `i` in range(len(`paths`)) where `k >= i + 1`. The value of `ress` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and `k - i` for all `i` in range(len(`paths`)) where `k >= i + 1`. The value of `i` is updated to be the length of `paths` if `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `paths`, otherwise `i` is the value that caused the break.
