According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must have at least 1 test case and the loop variable `_` is 0.
State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
