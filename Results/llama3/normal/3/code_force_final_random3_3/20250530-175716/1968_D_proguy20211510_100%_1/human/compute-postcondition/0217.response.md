Output State: **The loop iterates over the test cases in the input, and for each test case, it calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by Bodya and Sasha by traversing the permutation p and array a. The loop prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's maximum score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's maximum score is higher, and 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The loop continues until all test cases have been processed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the program has processed all test cases in the input and has printed the winner of each test case, either Bodya, Sasha, or Draw, based on their maximum scores calculated by traversing the permutation p and array a.
