Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `i`, `resb`, and `preb` remain unchanged, `curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`, and `ress` is the maximum of its original value and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `curr`, `pres`, and `ress`. The first line calculates a new value for `curr` by adding the product of `paths[i]` and `(k - i)` to `pres`. The second line increments `pres` by `paths[i]`. The third line updates `ress` to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
