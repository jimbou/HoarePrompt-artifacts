Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given permutation and array. The program first constructs the paths that Bodya and Sasha can take by traversing the permutation, and then calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by each player by considering all possible moves. The program then compares the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

The program handles the case where the game lasts for k turns, and the players can either stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation. The program also handles the case where the players can revisit positions in the permutation, and correctly calculates the maximum score that can be achieved in such cases.

The program uses a greedy approach to calculate the maximum score, which is correct because the game is a simple game where the players can only move forward in the permutation, and the score is determined by the sum of the values in the array. The program also uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum score, which is correct because the game has a recursive structure, and the maximum score can be calculated by considering all possible moves.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
