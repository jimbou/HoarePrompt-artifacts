Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths, and k is less than i + 1. If resb is greater than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If resb is less than or equal to ress, 'Sasha' is printed if ress is greater than resb, otherwise 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the execution of the if-else block, if the current value of resb is higher than the current value of ress, 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, if ress is greater than resb, 'Sasha' is printed; otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index p[ps - 1] - 1, and the value of a at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1 and has a length greater than or equal to k, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, the element at index p[ps - 1] - 1 which is 1, and the element at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i for all i in range(len(pathb)) where k >= i + 1, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i] for all i in range(len(pathb)) where k >= i + 1, pres is the sum of its original value and paths[i] for all i in range(len(paths)) where k >= i + 1, ress is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and k - i for all i in range(len(paths)) where k >= i + 1, i is k. Either 'Bodya' is printed when resb is greater than ress, or either 'Sasha' is printed when ress is greater than resb or 'Draw' is printed when resb is greater than or equal to ress.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
