Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `p[pb - 1] - 1`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `pb - 1` and the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the (`pb-1`)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` + 1, and if the (`pb-1`)th element of `vis` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
