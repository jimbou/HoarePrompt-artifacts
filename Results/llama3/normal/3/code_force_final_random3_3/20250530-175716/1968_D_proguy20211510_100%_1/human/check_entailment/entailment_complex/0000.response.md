Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game between Bodya and Sasha. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the integers and storing them in the appropriate variables.
2. It correctly constructs the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.
3. The program uses a visited array `vis` to keep track of the positions that have been visited during the traversal of the permutation. This is necessary to detect cycles in the permutation.
4. The program correctly calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by Bodya and Sasha by traversing the permutation and array. It uses a prefix sum array `preb` and `pres` to keep track of the cumulative sum of the scores, and updates the maximum score `resb` and `ress` accordingly.
5. The program correctly compares the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') accordingly.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
