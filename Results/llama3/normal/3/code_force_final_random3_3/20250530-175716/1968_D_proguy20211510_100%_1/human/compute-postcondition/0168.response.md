Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index p[ps - 1] - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1 and the value of a at index ps - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1.**

In this final state, the value of `ps` has been updated to be the value of `p` at index `ps - 1`. The list `paths` now contains two elements: the original value of `a` at index `ps - 1` and the new value of `a` at index `ps - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
