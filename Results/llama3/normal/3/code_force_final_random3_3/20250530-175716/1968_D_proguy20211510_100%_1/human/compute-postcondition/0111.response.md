Output State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `curr` is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i`, `preb` is an integer equal to its original value plus `pathb[i]`, `resb` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `curr`, `i` is an integer plus 1, `resb` is an integer, `preb` is an integer, `ress` is an integer, `pres` is an integer and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
