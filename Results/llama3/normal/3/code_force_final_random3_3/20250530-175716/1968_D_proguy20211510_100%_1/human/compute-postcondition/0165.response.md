Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `ps - 1`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing elements where each element is the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1`, `vis` is a list of `n` values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and we exit the current loop or if statement.
