Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is the value of p at index p[ps - 1] - 1, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1 four times, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1 three times, vis is a list of n integers with the (p[ps - 1] - 1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of a[ps - 1] and the difference between k and the length of paths, pres is incremented by the value of a[ps - 1], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1. If vis[ps - 1] is equal to 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
