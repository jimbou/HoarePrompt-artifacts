The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `len(pathb)`. If `i` is less than `len(pathb)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `len(pathb)` is an integer greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `curr` is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of `pathb[i]` and `k - i`, `preb` is an integer equal to its original value plus `pathb[i]`, `resb` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `curr`, `i` is an integer plus 1, `resb` is an integer, `preb` is an integer, `ress` is an integer, `pres` is an integer**
