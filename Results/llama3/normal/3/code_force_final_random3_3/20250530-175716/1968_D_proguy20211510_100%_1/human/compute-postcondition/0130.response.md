Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `resb`, and `preb` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, then `curr` is `pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1))`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i+1]`, and `ress` is the maximum of its original value and `pres + paths[i+1] * (k - (i+1))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
