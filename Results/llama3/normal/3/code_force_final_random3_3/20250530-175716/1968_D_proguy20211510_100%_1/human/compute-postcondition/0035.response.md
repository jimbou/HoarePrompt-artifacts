Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is the value of p[p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1 that must have at least 1 element, paths is a list containing the value of a[ps - 1], a[p[ps - 1] - 1], a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1], and a[p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1], vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1, resb is 0, ress is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the current loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program will continue executing from the next statement outside the loop or if statement.
