Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the value of a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1 and currently the value of vis[pb - 1] is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input, _ is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
