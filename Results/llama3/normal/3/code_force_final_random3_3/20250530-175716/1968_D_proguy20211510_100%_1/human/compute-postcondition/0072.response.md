Postcondition: ***curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths, and k is less than i + 1. If resb is greater than ress, 'Bodya' is printed. If resb is less than or equal to ress, 'Sasha' is printed if ress is greater than resb, otherwise 'Draw' is printed.***
