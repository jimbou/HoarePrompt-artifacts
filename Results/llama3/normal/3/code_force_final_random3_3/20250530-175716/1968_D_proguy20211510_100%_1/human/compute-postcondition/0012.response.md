Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1.**
