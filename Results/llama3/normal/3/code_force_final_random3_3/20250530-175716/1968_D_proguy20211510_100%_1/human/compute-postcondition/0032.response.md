Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[pb - 1] when vis[pb - 1] is 1, ps is the value of p[p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1], p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], a[p[p[pb - 1] - 1]], and so on until vis[pb - 1] is 1, paths is a list containing the value of a[ps - 1], a[p[ps - 1] - 1], a[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1], and a[p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1], vis is a list of n zeros with the ps-1th element set to 1, resb is 0, ress is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0.**

The code initializes four new variables: resb, ress, preb, and pres, all set to 0. The initial state's variables and their values remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The final state includes the newly introduced variables with their assigned values, while the rest of the variables retain their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
