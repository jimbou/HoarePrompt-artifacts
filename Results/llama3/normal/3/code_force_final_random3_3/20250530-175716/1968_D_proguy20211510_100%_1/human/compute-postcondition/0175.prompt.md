Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index ps - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1. If vis[ps - 1] is 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing elements where each element is the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1` and the value of `a` at index `ps - 1`, `vis` is a list of `n` values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `ps - 1` which is 1, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`. If the element at index `ps - 1` in `vis` is 1, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index ps - 1, and the value of a at index p[ps - 1] - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1 and the element at index p[ps - 1] - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1. If the element at index ps - 1 in the list vis is 1, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
