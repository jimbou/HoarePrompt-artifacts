Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index p[ps - 1] - 1, and the value of a at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, the element at index p[ps - 1] - 1 which is 1, and the element at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1, resb is 0, ress is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing at least one element where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index p[ps - 1] - 1, and the value of a at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, the element at index p[ps - 1] - 1 which is 1, and the element at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], pres is 0, i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing at least two elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index p[ps - 1] - 1, the value of a at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1, and the value of a at index p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1, the element at index p[ps - 1] - 1 which is 1, the element at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1 which is 1, and the element at index p[p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and k - i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], pres is 0, i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`, `pb`, `resb`, `preb`, and `i` retain their original values as described in the precondition. `curr` is set to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, `preb` is incremented by `pathb[i]`, and `resb` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
