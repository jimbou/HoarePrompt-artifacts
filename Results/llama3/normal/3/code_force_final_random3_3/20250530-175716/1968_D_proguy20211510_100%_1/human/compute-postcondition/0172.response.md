Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is the value of p at index p[p[ps - 1] - 1] - 1, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing elements where each element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1, the value of a at index ps - 1, and the value of a at index p[ps - 1] - 1, vis is a list of n values where all elements are 0 except for the element at index ps - 1 which is 1 and the element at index p[ps - 1] - 1 which is 1, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1.**

The first line appends the value of `a` at index `ps - 1` to the list `paths`. This means that `paths` now contains the value of `a` at index `ps - 1` twice. The second line assigns the value of `p` at index `ps - 1` to `ps`. This means that `ps` now points to a new index in the list `p`, and the value of `ps` is updated accordingly. The value of `vis` at index `p[ps - 1] - 1` is also updated to 1, indicating that this index has been visited.
