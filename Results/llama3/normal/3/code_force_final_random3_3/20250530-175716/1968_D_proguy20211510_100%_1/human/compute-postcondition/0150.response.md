Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing a single element which is the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of `n` values where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `pb - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains no input.
