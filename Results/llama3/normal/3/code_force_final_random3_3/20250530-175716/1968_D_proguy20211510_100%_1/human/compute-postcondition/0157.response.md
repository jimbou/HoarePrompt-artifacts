Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are the value of a at index pb - 1 and the third element is the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values where the element at index pb - 1 is 1 and all other elements are 0, pb is the value of p at index pb - 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `a` at index `pb - 1` to the list `pathb`. Since `pathb` initially contains two elements, both of which are the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, the third element appended will also be the same value. Therefore, `pathb` now contains three elements, all of which are the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`.

The second line assigns the value of `p` at index `pb - 1` to `pb`. This means that `pb` now holds the value of `p` at the index that was previously stored in `pb`. The value of `pb` is updated, but its relationship with the other variables remains the same.

All other variables, including `n`, `k`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `paths`, and `vis`, remain unchanged. The state of `vis` is still a list of `n` values where the element at index `pb - 1` is 1 and all other elements are 0, indicating that the element at index `pb - 1` has been visited.
