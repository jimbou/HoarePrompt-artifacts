Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1, the value of a at index pb - 1, the value of a at index pb - 1, and the value of a at index pb - 1, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the (ps-1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is incremented by the value of paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `ps - 1`, `pathb` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, and the value of `a` at index `pb - 1`, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the (`ps-1`)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is equal to the length of `paths + 1`. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pb` is the value of `p` at index `p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1`, `ps` is the value of `p` at index `p[ps - 1] - 1`, `pathb` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `pb - 1` four times, `paths` is a list containing the value of `a` at index `ps - 1` twice, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with the `(p[ps - 1] - 1)`th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, `curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `a[ps - 1]` and the difference between `k` and the length of `paths`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `a[ps - 1]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is equal to the length of `paths` + 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer, k is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pb is the value of p at index p[p[p[pb - 1] - 1] - 1] - 1, ps is the value of p at index p[ps - 1] - 1, pathb is a list containing the value of a at index pb - 1 four times, paths is a list containing the value of a at index ps - 1 three times, vis is a list of n integers with the (p[ps - 1] - 1)th element being 1 and all other elements being 0, curr is the sum of pres and the product of a[ps - 1] and the difference between k and the length of paths, pres is incremented by the value of a[ps - 1], ress is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is equal to the length of paths + 1. If vis[ps - 1] is equal to 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
