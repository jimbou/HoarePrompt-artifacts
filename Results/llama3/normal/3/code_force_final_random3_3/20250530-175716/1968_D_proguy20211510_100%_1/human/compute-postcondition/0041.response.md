Output State: **curr is the sum of the original value of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is incremented by the value of pathb[i], resb is the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr, i is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to i + 1, otherwise i remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of curr is updated by adding the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i to the original value of preb. The value of preb is then incremented by the value of pathb[i]. The value of resb is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of curr. The value of i is incremented by 1 if k is greater than or equal to i + 1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
