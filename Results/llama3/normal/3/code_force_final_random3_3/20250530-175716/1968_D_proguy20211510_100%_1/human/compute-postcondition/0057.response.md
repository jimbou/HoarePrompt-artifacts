Output State: **`curr` is the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i-1]` and the difference between `k` and `i-1`, `pres` is incremented by the value of `paths[i-1]`, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `paths` must have a length greater than the new value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, and `i` remain the same as before, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The length of `paths` is still greater than the new value of `i`.
