Output State: **`curr` is the sum of the original value of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i+1]` and the difference between `k` and `i+1`, `preb` is incremented by the value of `pathb[i+1]`, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `curr`, `preb`, and `resb` remain unchanged because the `break` statement only exits the loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The value of `i` is also unchanged because the `break` statement does not affect the value of `i`. The only change is that we exit the loop or if statement.
