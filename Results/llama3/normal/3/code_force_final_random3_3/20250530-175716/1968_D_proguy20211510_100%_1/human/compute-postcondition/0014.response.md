Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value of p[p[pb - 1] - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the values of a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[p[pb - 1]], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n zeros with the pb-1th element set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of any variables.
