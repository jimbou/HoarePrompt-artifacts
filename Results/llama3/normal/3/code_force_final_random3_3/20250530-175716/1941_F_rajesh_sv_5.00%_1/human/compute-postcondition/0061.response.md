The variables in the loop head are `l` and `h`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `h` are updated based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` such that `l` is still less than `h`. Since `l` is updated to the average of the original `l` and `h` plus 1 when the condition is true, and `h` is updated to the average of `l` and the previous value of `h` minus 1 when the condition is false, we can conclude that `l` must be less than the average of `l` and `h` minus 1, and `h` must be greater than the average of `l` and `h` plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is less than the average of `l` and `h` minus 1, `h` is greater than the average of `l` and `h` plus 1, `ans`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are updated based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`**
