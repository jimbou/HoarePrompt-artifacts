Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `A`, and `next_max_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `A`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, with the addition of `next_max_diff` being assigned the same value as `diff`, which is the difference between the third and second elements of list `A`.
