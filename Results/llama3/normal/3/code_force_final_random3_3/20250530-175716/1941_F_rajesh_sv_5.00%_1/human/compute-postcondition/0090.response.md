Postcondition: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and is equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and is equal to l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F, and the current value of l is equal to the current value of h.**
