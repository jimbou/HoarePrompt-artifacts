Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, and index is the index of the maximum difference in A.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the maximum difference between consecutive elements in list A is stored in max_diff, the second maximum difference is stored in next_max_diff, and the index of the maximum difference is stored in index. The values of n, m, k, A, D, and F remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
