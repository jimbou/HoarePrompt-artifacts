The only variable in the loop head is variable `f`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f`. If `f` is in `F`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `f` is in `F`. For the loop to execute again, `f` must be the next value in `F`.
State: **`l` is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is D[mid] + f, `mid_next_sum` is D[mid + 1] + f, `f` is the next value in F**
