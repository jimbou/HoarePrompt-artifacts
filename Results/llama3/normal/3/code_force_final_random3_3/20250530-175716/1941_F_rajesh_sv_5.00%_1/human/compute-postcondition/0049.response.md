To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to examine the condition `l < h`. Given the initial states:

* `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order.
* `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1.
* `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.

We only need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` since they are the variables in the loop head.

For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than `h`. Given their definitions, we need to ensure that the insertion point of `left - f` is less than the insertion point of `right - f` minus 1. This implies that `right - f` must be greater than `left - f` by at least 2 to accommodate the subtraction of 1 from `h`'s insertion point and still satisfy `l < h`.

Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `h` themselves, but we need to ensure that the values they are derived from (`left`, `right`, and `f`) are such that `right - f` is at least 2 more than `left - f`. However, since we cannot directly adjust `left`, `right`, or `f`, and given that `l` and `h` are defined based on these values, we can infer that for the loop to execute, the condition derived from their definitions must inherently be satisfied.

Thus, the state remains as initially described, with the understanding that the relationship between `left`, `right`, and `f` must allow for `l` to be less than `h` based on their definitions.

State: **`l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**
