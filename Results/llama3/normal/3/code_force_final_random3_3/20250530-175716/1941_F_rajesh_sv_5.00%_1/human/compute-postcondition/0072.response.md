To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `l < h` and adjust the states of `l` and `h` accordingly.

Right before the loop, `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, and `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1.

For the loop to execute the first time, `l` must be less than `h`. Since `l` and `h` are insertion points in a sorted list `D`, we can infer that `l` should be less than or equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at `h`.

Therefore, the states of `l` and `h` need to be adjusted as follows:

* `l` must be less than or equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at `h`.
* `h` must be greater than `l`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order and `l` is less than or equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at `h`, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 and `h` is greater than `l`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `f` is the next value in `F`**
