To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (a throwaway variable) and `testcases`. Since `_` is not used anywhere, we can ignore it. The loop will execute if `testcases` is at least 1.

State: **`testcases` is at least 1**
