Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `A`, `max_diff` is either the previous value of `max_diff` or `diff` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `index` is either the previous value of `index` or 3 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial properties, except for `next_max_diff`, which is now assigned the value of `diff`, which is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `A`.
