Postcondition: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. The current value of mid_sum minus left is less than the current value of right minus mid_next_sum.**
