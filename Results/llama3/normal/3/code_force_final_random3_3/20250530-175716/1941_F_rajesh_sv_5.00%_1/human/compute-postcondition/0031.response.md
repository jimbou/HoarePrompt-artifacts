Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, mid is the middle index of the range [l, h], mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f, h is the middle index of the range [l, h]. The difference between mid_sum and left is not less than the difference between right and mid_next_sum.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of h is now equal to mid, which is the middle index of the range [l, h]. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
