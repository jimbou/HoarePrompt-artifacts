Output State: **l is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, h is the average of `l` and the previous value of `h` minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, mid is the average of `l` and the previous value of `h` minus 1, mid_sum is `D[mid] + f`, mid_next_sum is `D[mid + 1] + f**.

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be the average of `l` and the previous value of `h` minus 1, which is equivalent to the value of `mid`. The values of `l`, `ans`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is also updated to be the average of `l` and the previous value of `h` minus 1.
