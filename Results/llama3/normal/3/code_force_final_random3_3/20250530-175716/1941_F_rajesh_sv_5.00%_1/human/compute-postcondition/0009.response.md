Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]`, `index` is set to 1, and `next_max_diff` is -inf. Otherwise, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]`.***
