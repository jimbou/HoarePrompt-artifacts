The value of `h` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `l` and `h`. Since `h` is now equal to `mid`, we can conclude that `h` is now less than or equal to the average of `l` and `h` plus 1.

Output State: **`l` is less than the average of `l` and `h` minus 1, `h` is equal to the average of `l` and `h`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is not updated**
