Postcondition: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then the current value of l is greater than the average of its previous value and h. Otherwise, the current value of h is the insertion point of mid - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, and the difference between mid_sum and left is larger than or equal to the difference between right and mid_next_sum. Additionally, the current value of l is equal to the current value of h.**
