Output State: **`l` is the average of the original `l` and `h` plus 1, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid` is the average of the original `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**.

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be one more than the average of its original value and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `h` still being the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` still being the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, and `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` still being the average of the original `l` and `h`, `D[mid] + f`, and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively.
