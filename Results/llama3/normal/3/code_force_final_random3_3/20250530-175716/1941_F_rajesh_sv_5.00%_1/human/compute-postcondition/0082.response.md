Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the average of l and h, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F.**

In this output state, the value of h has been updated to be the average of l and h, which is the same as mid. The other variables remain unchanged.
