Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is equal to l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that l and h are equal, indicating that the binary search has converged to a single index. The value of l (and h) is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, and it is also equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at h. The value of ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f. The values of mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum, and f remain unchanged.
