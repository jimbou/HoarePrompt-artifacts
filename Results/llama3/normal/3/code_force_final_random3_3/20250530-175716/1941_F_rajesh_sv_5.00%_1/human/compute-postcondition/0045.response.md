Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`**.

In this output state, the value of `l` and `h` remains the same as they were equal initially and no operation was performed on them. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of two expressions: `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. This means that `ans` will take the smaller value between its previous value and the maximum of these two expressions.
