The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. If `testcases` is at least 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is at least 2, and the function `func_6()` has been executed twice. For the loop to execute again, `testcases` must be at least 3.

State: **`testcases` is at least 3, and the function `func_6()` has been executed twice**
