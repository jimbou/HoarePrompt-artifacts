Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

In this output state, the values of `l`, `h`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code snippet. The code introduces two new variables, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`, which are calculated based on the values of `l` and `h`. The value of `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, and `mid_next_sum` is the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`.
