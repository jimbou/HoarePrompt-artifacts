Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `A`.**

In this output state, the value of `diff` is calculated as the difference between the third element (`A[i]`) and the second element (`A[i - 1]`) of list `A`, where `i` is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
