Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, and h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that utilize the bisect module's bisect_right and bisect_left functions to find the insertion points for left - f and right - f in the sorted list D, respectively. The first line assigns the insertion point for left - f in D to the variable l, and the second line assigns the insertion point for right - f in D minus one to the variable h. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
