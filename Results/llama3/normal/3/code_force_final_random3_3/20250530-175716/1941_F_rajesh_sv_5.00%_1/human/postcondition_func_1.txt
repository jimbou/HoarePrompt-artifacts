This function memoizes the result of another function `func` by storing its results in a dictionary `d` for given input arguments `args`. It returns the result of `func` for the given `args`, either by retrieving it from the dictionary if it already exists, or by computing it, storing it in the dictionary, and then returning it. The function modifies the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair if the input `args` is not already present.
