Output State: **`l` is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is D[mid] + f, `mid_next_sum` is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then the current value of `l` is greater than the average of its previous value and `h`. Otherwise, the current value of `h` is the insertion point of mid - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, and the difference between mid_sum and left is larger than or equal to the difference between right and mid_next_sum. Additionally, the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `h`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of the sum of the value at index `l` in array `D`, `f`, and `-left`, and the difference between `right` and the sum of the value at index `l` in array `D` and `-f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
