Output State: **`testcases` is at least 3, and the function `func_6()` has been executed `testcases` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `testcases` is at least 3 (since it was at least 3 after the first 3 iterations), and the function `func_6()` has been executed as many times as the value of `testcases`.
