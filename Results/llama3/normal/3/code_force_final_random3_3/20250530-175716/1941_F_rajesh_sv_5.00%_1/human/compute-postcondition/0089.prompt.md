Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than or equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is the average of the previous l and h plus 1. Otherwise, h is the average of l and h.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l and h is greater than the index of the element that would be inserted at l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to the average of l and h.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l and h is greater than the index of the element that would be inserted at l and h is greater than l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is the average of the previous l and h plus 1. Otherwise, h is the average of l and h.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
