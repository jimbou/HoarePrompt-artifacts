This function calls and returns the result of another function named `func_2()`, effectively acting as a proxy or wrapper for `func_2()`. It does not perform any additional actions or modifications on the input variables, as there are no input parameters. The function's sole purpose is to delegate its execution to `func_2()` and return its result.
