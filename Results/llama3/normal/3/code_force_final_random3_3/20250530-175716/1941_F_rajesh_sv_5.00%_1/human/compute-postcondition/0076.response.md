Postcondition: ***l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than or equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F, and mid_sum - left is greater than or equal to right - mid_next_sum***
