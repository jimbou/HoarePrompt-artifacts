Output State: **l is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, h is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, mid is the average of `l` and `h`, mid_sum is `D[mid] + f`, mid_next_sum is `D[mid + 1] + f, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f**
