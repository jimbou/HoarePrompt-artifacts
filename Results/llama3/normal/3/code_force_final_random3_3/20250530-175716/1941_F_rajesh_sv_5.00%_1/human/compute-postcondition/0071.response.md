Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F**

The code updates the values of `l` and `h` based on the binary search functions `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` respectively. The new values of `l` and `h` are calculated using the given formulas, which involve the variables `left`, `f`, `D`, and `right`. The other variables `ans`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
