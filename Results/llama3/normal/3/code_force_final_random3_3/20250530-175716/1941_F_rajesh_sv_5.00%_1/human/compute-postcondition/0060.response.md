Postcondition: **`l`, `h`, `ans`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are updated based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`. If the condition is true, `l` is updated to the average of the original `l` and `h` plus 1, and `h` remains the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. If the condition is false, `h` is updated to the average of `l` and the previous value of `h` minus 1, and `l` remains less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. In both cases, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, and `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are updated accordingly.**
