Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h must be greater than l, mid is the middle index of the range [l, h], mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f.**

The code calculates the middle index `mid` of the range `[l, h]` and uses it to compute `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`, which are the sums of `D[mid]` and `f`, and `D[mid + 1]` and `f`, respectively. The values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are determined based on the values of `l`, `h`, `D`, and `f`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
