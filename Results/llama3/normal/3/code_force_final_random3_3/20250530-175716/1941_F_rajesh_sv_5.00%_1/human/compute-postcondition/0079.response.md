According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order and `l` is less than or equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at `h`, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 and `h` is greater than `l`. `l` being less than or equal to the index of the element that would be inserted at `h` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is less than the index of the element that would be inserted at `h`. `h` being greater than `l` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `h` is greater than `l` and `h` is greater than the index of the element that would be inserted at `l`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order and `l` is less than the index of the element that would be inserted at `h`, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 and `h` is greater than `l` and `h` is greater than the index of the element that would be inserted at `l`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `f` is the next value in `F`.**
