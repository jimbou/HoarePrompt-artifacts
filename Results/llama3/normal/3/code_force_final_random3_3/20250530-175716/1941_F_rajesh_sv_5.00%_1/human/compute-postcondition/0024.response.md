To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `f` and the list `F`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `F`. If the list `F` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `k` is a positive integer, we know that `F` has at least 1 element.

Therefore, we can adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the element before the maximum difference in `A`, `right` is the element after the maximum difference in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, and `f` is the first element in `F`**
