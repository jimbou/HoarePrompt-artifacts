Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the element before the maximum difference in `A`, `right` is the element after the maximum difference in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `f` is the first element in `F`, `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` must be greater than `l`, `mid` is the middle index of the range `[l, h]`, `mid_sum` is the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, `mid_next_sum` is the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`. If the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.**
