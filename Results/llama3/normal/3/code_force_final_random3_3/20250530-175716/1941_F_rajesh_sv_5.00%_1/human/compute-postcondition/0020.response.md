Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `A`, `max_diff` is either the previous value of `max_diff` or `diff` if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, `index` is either the previous value of `index` or 3 if `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, and `next_max_diff` is either the previous value of `next_max_diff` or `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff` but not greater than `max_diff`. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.***
