Output State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()`, which is unknown since the definition of `func_3()` is not provided**

In this output state, the value of `testcases` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_3()`. However, since the definition of `func_3()` is not provided, the exact value of `testcases` is unknown. The initial state of `testcases` being a non-negative integer is no longer applicable, as its value is now determined by the return value of `func_3()`.
