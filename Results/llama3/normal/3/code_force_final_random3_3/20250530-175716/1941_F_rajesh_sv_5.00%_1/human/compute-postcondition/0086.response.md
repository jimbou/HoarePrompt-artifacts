Output State: **l is the average of the previous l and h plus 1, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l and h is greater than the index of the element that would be inserted at l and h is greater than l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of the previous l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of l is updated to be the average of its previous value and h plus 1. The values of h, ans, mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum, and f remain the same as before. The relationship between l and h is still maintained, with h being greater than l and the index of the element that would be inserted at l. The value of ans is still the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.
