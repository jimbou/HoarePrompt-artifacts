Output State: **l is equal to h.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `l` is equal to `h`. This means that the loop has converged to a single point, and the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order has been found. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
