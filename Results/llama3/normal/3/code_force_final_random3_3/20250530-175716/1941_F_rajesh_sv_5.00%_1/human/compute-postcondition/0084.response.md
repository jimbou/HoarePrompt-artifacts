The variables in the loop head are l and h, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l and h. If l is less than h, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l and h is greater than the index of the element that would be inserted at l. For the loop to execute again, l must be less than h, so h must be greater than l. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than the index of the element that would be inserted at h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l and h is greater than the index of the element that would be inserted at l and h is greater than l, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, f is the next value in F.**
