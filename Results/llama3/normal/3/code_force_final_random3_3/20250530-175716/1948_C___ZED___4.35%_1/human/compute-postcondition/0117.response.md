Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, `k` is `n`, and `no_path` is True**

The code sets the value of `no_path` to True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, stdin, and `k` is still valid as they were not affected by the code.
