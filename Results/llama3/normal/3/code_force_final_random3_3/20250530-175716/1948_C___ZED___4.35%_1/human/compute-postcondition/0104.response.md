Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, `no_path` is True, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t-7 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been updated to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, and `k` is an integer still holds. Additionally, there are still t-7 test cases in the stdin.
