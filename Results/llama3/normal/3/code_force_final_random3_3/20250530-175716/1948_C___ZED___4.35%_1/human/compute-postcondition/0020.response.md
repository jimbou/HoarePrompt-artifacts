Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is 2. If the current value of `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.***
