Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is 4. If `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains unchanged.***
