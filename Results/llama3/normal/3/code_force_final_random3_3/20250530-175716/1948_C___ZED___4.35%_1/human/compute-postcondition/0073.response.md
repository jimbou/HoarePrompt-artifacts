The code prints the value of `k` which is an index in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', where `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and `no_path` is True.
Output: ** `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is 1, there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', and `no_path` is True, and the value of k is being printed**
