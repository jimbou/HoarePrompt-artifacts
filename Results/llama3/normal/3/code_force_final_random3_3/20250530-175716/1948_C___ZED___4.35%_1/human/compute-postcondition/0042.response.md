Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even, `k` is `n-1` if `n` is odd. Initially, `no_path` is False, and it remains False if any `a[k]` is not '>', otherwise it remains True. Currently, `no_path` is True***
