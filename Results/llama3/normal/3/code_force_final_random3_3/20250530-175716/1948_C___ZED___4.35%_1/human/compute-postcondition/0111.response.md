Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, `no_path` is False, `k` is 2. If `b[k]` is not '>', the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change is made to the program state.***
