Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases. If the character at index `k` in string `b` is not '>', then `no_path` is set to False and `k` remains 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
