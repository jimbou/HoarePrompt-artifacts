Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even, `k` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, `no_path` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is: The input `stdin` still contains t-1 test cases. The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The strings `a` and `b` still consist of '<' and '>' characters and have a length of `n`. The value of `i` is still 0. The second last character of `b` is still '>'. The value of `n` is still not equal to 1. The value of `k` is still dependent on whether `n` is even or odd. However, the value of `no_path` has been updated to True, indicating that there is no path.
