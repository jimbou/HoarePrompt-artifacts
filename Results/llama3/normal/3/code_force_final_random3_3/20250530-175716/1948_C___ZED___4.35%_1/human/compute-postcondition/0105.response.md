According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `k`. If `n` is at least 2 and `k` is 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, `no_path` is True, `k` is an integer, stdin contains t-7 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  `n` is at least 2 and `k` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, `no_path` is True, `k` is 0, stdin contains t-7 test cases.**
