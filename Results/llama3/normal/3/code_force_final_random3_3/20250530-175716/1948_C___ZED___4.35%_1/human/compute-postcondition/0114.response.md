Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, `no_path` is False, `k` is 4. If `b[k]` is not '>', then the program continues with the current state. Otherwise, the program does not specify any changes to the state.**
