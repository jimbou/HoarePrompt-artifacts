Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even, `k` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, and `no_path` is False if any `a[k]` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains True.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` as in the initial state. The value of `k` will be either `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd), depending on the parity of `n`. The value of `no_path` will be False if any of the characters `a[k]` (for `k` ranging from 1 to `n-1` in steps of 2) is not '>', otherwise it will remain True.
