Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, `no_path` is False, `k` is 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and the current value of `b[k]` is not '>'**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been changed to False, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The precondition that `n` is at least 2, `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, and stdin contains t-5 test cases is still valid. Additionally, the current value of `b[k]` is still not '>'.
