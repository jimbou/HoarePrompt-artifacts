Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is 2, `no_path` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `no_path` is set to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input stream still contains t-1 test cases, and the strings `a` and `b` maintain their original lengths and compositions of '<' and '>' characters. The index `i` remains at 0, and the second last character of `b` is still '>'. The value of `n` is still between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and not equal to 1. The value of `k` is still 2.
