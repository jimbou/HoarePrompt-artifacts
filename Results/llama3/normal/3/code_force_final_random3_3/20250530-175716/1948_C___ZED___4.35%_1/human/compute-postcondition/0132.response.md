Output State: **`n` is an integer between 5 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, `no_path` is False, stdin contains t-7 test cases, and the value of `k` which is 5 has been printed.**

The code sets the value of `no_path` to False, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still 5 and has been printed. The stdin still contains t-7 test cases.
