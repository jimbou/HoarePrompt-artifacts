Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', then `k` is `n` - 1 and `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` is True. Additionally, `no_path` is False***
