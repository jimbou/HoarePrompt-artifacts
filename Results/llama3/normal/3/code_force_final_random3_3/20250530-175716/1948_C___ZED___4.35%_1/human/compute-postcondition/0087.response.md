Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is `n` - 1, there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', and `no_path` is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all odd indices from 1 to `n` - 1, and for each index `k`, if `a[k]` is not '>', it has printed the value of `k`. The loop has also set `no_path` to False if it encountered any index `k` where `a[k]` is not '>'. The other variables remain unchanged.
