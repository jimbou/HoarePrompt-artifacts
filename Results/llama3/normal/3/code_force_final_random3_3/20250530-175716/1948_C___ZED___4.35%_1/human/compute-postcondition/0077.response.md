The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 2 so `k` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is 3, there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', and `no_path` is False, and the value of k is being printed if `a[k]` is not '>'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
