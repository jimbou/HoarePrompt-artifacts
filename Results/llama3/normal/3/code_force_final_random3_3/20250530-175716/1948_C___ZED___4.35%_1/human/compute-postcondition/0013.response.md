Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `n` is not equal to 1, `no_path` is False, `k` is 0, and the current value of `b[k]` is not '>'**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been changed to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `no_path` was True is no longer valid, and it has been updated to False. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
