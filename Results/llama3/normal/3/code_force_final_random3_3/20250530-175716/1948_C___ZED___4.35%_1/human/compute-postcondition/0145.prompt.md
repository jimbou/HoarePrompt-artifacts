Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. n is even.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 0. If the second last character of b is not '>', 'NO' is printed. If the second last character of b is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is not equal to 1, k is n-2 if n is even, k is n-1 if n is odd. If no_path is True, then 'YES' is printed. If no_path is False, then 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 1, no_path is False, k is an integer, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If b[-2] is not '>', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if there exists an index k in the range [0, n) such that k is even and b[k] is not '>', then k is n - 1 and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 2, no_path is False, k is an integer, stdin contains t-7 test cases. If b[-2] is not '>', then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is not 1, then if a[k] is '>' for some k in the range 1 to n-1 with a step of 2, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
