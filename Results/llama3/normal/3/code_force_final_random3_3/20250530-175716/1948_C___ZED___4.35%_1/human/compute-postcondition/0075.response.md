Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is 1, there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', and `no_path` is False, and the value of k is being printed. The current value of `a[k]` is not '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `no_path` has been changed to False, while all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`, and the stdin test cases are unchanged. The condition that there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>' still holds, and the value of `k` is still being printed. Additionally, the current value of `a[k]` is still not '>'.
