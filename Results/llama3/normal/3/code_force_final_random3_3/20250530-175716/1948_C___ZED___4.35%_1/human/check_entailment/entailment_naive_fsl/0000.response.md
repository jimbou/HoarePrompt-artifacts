Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES'. The robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the arrow in the second last cell of the second row is '>' and if all the arrows in the first row are '>'. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The program does not consider the possibility of the robot moving down from the first row to the second row and then moving right to reach the cell (2, n).

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
