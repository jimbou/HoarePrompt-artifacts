To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1` with a step of 2). Additionally, `k` should be initialized to 1, as it is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is 1, there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', and `no_path` is True**
