The only variable in the loop head is variable `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `n` is between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so `k` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, `no_path` is False if `a[k]` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains True, and the value of `k` which is 3 is being printed.**
