Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 2, no_path is False, k is an integer, stdin contains t-7 test cases. If n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is not 1, then if a[k] is '>' for some k in the range 1 to n-1 with a step of 2, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
