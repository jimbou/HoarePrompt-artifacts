Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, and the value of `k` which is 3 has been printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains unchanged.***
