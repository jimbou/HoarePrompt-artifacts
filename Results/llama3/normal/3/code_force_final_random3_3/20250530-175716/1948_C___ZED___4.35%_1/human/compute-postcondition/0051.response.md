The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input. If `i` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and there are t-1 test cases left in the input. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 1, no_path is False, k is an integer**
