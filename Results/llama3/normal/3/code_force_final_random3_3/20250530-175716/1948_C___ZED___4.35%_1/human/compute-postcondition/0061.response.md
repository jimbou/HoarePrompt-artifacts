Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If the character at index `k` of string `b` is not '>', then `no_path` is False and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True and `k` remains unchanged.***
