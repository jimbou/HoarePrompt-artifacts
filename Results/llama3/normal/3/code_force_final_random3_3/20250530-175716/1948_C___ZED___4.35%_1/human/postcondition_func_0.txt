This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It then checks if a path exists between the two strings based on certain conditions. If the second string does not end with a '>', it prints 'NO'. If the length of the strings is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a '>' character at every odd index in the first string. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
