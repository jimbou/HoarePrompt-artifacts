Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, `k` is `n-1`, and `no_path` is False if `a[k]` is not '>' for any `k` in the range 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2, otherwise `no_path` remains True.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `k` will be `n-1`, and the value of `no_path` will be False if any character in the string `a` at an odd index is not '>', otherwise it will remain True. The other variables remain unchanged.
