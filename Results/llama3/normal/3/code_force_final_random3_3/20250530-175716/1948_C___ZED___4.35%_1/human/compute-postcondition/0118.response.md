According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `k`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `k` is `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3 and `k` is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, `k` is 1, and `no_path` is True**
