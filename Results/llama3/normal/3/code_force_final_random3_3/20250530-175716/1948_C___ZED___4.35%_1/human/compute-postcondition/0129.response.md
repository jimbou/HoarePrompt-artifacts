The only variable in the loop head is variable `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 2 so `k` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer between 5 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, and the value of `k` which is 5 has been printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains unchanged.**
