Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 0**

In this output state, the code has read the first test case from stdin, which contains an integer n and two strings a and b. The value of n is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and a and b are strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The variable i remains unchanged at 0. The remaining t-1 test cases are still in stdin.
