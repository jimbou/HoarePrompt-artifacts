Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is 4, `no_path` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been explicitly set to False, regardless of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases.
