Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is `n`, `no_path` is False if there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` is True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, still being an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
*   The strings `a` and `b` also remain unchanged, still consisting of '<' and '>' characters and having a length of `n`.
*   The value of `i` remains 1.
*   The contents of stdin remain unchanged, still containing t-5 test cases.
*   The value of `k` is now `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all even indices in the range [0, `n`).
*   The value of `no_path` is determined by the existence of an even index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `b[k]` is not '>'. If such an index exists, `no_path` is False; otherwise, it remains True.
