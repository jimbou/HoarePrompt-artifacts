Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 2, no_path is False, k is an integer, stdin contains t-7 test cases.**

The code reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from stdin, each of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `i`, `no_path`, and `k` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
