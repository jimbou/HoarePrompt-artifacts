Output State: **i is t-1, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, no_path is False, k is an integer. If b[-2] is not '>', 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is not 1, then if a[k] is '>' for some k in the range 1 to n-1 with a step of 2, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` has reached `t-1`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The input stream `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been read. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` still hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no_path` is `False`, indicating that the loop has found a path for the last test case. The variable `k` holds the index of the last character in the string `a` that was checked. The output of the program is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether a path was found for the last test case.
