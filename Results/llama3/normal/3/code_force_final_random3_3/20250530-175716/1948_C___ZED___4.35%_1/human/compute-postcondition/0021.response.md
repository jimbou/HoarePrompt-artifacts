Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even, `k` is `n-1` if `n` is odd. If any value of `b[k]` for `k` in range(0, n, 2) is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `k` will be either `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd), and `no_path` will be False if any of the characters at even indices in string `b` are not '>', otherwise it will remain True. The other variables remain unchanged.
