To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `k` and the integer `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 0 and increments by 2). Since `n` is already given to be between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, we don't need to adjust `n`. However, we need to adjust `k` to be 0, since the loop starts from 0.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `n` is not equal to 1, `no_path` is True, `k` is 0**
