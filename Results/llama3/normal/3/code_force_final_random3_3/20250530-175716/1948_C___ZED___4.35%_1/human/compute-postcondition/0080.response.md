Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is 3, there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', and `no_path` is False, and the value of k which is 3 is being printed because `a[k]` is not '>'**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `no_path`, which was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
