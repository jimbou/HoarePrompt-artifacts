Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is `n`, there exists an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>', and `no_path` is True**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `no_path` has been changed to True, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`, and the existence of an index `k` in the range [0, `n`) such that `k` is even and `b[k]` is not '>' are still valid.
