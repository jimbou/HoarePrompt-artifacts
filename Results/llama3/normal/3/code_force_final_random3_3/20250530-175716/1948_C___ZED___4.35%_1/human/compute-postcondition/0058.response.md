The only variables in the loop head are variable k and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n and k. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, so it needs to be adjusted to n is at least 2 and k is now 0.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, `no_path` is True, `k` is 0, stdin contains t-5 test cases**
