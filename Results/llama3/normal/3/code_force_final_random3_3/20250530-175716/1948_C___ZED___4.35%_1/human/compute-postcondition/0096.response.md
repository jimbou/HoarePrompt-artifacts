Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 1, no_path is False, k is an integer, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If n is 1, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, if there exists an index k in the range [0, n) such that k is even and b[k] is not '>', then k is n - 1 and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
