Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 1, no_path is False, k is an integer, stdin contains t-5 test cases**

The code block reads three lines from stdin: an integer `n`, and two strings `a` and `b`. The value of `n` is assigned to the variable `n`, overwriting its initial value. The strings `a` and `b` are assigned to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `i`, `no_path`, and `k` remain unchanged. After reading three lines from stdin, there are `t-5` test cases left in stdin.
