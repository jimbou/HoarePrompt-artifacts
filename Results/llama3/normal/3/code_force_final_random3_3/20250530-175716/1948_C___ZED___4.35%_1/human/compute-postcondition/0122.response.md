Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-7 test cases, `k` is 1, `no_path` is False, and the value of `k` which is 1 is being printed. The current value of `a[k]` is not '>'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `no_path` has been changed to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still being printed, and the current value of `a[k]` is still not '>'.
