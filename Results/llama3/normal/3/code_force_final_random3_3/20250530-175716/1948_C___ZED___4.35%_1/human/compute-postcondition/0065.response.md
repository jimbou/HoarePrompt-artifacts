To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for k in range(0, n, 2):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to `n` with a step size of 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 2 (since `i` is 1 and `k` is incremented by 2 in each iteration). For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` is at least 2, we can increment `k` by 2 to get the next value in the range. Therefore, `k` should be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables in the loop head are `n`, which remains unchanged, and the range object, which is not a variable that can be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `k` is 4. If `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains unchanged.**
