The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k. If k is less than n - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is 3, n is an integer between 4 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again k must be increased by 2 so k is 5 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 5.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 6 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', and the value of `k` which is 5 has been printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
