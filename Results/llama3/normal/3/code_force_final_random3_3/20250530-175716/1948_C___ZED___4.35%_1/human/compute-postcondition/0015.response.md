The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 2 so `k` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 0, the second last character of `b` is '>', `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is 2. If the current value of `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
