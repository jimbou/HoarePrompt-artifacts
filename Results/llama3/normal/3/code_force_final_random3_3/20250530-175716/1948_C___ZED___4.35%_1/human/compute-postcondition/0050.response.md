Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is 0. If the second last character of b is not '>', 'NO' is printed. If the second last character of b is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is not equal to 1, k is n-2 if n is even, k is n-1 if n is odd. If no_path is True, then 'YES' is printed. If no_path is False, then 'NO' is printed.***
