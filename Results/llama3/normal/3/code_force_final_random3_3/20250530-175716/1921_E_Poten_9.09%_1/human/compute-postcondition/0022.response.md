Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. If the fourth element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the fifth element of `clues` minus the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
