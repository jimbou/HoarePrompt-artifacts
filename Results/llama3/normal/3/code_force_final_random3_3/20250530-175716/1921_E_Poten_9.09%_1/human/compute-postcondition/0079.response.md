Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the current value of `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or the current value of `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the fourth element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the fifth element of `clues` minus the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of half of the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of half of the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
