Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b. It then determines the winner of a game based on the given coordinates and prints the result for each test case. The possible outcomes are 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results in the order they were received.**
