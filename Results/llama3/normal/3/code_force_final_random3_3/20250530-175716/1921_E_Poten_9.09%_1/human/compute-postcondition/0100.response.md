Postcondition: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then 'Bob' is added at the end of the list `answers`. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then 'Draw' is added to `answers` if `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise 'Bob' is added to `answers`.**
