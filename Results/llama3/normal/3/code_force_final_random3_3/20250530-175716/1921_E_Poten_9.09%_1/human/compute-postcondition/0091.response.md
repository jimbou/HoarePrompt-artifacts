Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending 'Draw' to the list. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
