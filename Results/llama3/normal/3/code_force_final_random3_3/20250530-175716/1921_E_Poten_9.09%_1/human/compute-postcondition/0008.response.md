Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`.**

In this output state, the list `answers` now contains the string 'Bob' as its only element, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the elements of `clues` and the value of `i` are still valid.
