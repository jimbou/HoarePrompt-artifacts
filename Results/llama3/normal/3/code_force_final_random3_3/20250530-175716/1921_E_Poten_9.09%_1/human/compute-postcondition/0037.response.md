Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or the string 'Bob', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. If the current value of `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` or the current value of `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'.***
