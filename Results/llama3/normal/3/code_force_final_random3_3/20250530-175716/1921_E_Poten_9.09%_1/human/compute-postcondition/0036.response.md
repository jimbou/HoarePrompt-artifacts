Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, and the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of answers now contains the string 'Bob', while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
