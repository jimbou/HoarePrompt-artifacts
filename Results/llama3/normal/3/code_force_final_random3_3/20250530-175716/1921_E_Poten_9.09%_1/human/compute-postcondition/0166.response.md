The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the answers.  If the list has at least 2 answers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, answers has at least 1 answer, j is the first answer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 answers and the j is the second answer in the list.
State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' that must have at least 2 answers, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, j is the second answer in the list, stdin is empty, and the second answer in the list which is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' is being printed**
