Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. The current value of `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` or the current value of `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of answers now contains the string 'Draw', while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the elements of the `clues` list and the relationship between `clues[1]`, `clues[3]`, `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are still valid.
