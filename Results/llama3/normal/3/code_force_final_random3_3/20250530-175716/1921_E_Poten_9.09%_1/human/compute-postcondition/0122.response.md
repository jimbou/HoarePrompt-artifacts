Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `clues` has been updated to a new list of integers from the input. The values of `test_cases`, `answers`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, since one test case has been read to update the value of `clues`.
