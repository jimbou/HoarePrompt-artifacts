Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code appends 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `answers` now contains an additional element 'Draw'. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
