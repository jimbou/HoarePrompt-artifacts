Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 2 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to `answers`.***
