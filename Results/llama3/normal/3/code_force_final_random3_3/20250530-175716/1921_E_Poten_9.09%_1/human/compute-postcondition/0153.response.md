Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the list `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw' as its last element, in addition to its previous elements which could be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `clues` still holds a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` remains an integer greater than 1, and `i` is still 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
