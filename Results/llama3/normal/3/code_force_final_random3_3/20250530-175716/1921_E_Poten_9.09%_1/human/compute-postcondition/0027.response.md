Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is greater than 1. The difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues`, or the difference between the fourth and sixth elements of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues`.***
