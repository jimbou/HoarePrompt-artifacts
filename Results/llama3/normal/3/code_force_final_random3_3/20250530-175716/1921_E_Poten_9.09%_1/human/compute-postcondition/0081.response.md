Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `clues` has been updated to a list of integers from the input, which was previously a list of integers but with unknown values. The other variables, `test_cases`, `answers`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, as one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function.
