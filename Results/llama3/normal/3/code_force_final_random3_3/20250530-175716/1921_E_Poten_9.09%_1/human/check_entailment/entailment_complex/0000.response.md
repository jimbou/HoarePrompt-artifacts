Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are clearly defined in the problem description. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b. These integers represent the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

The program then uses a series of conditional statements to determine the winner of the game based on the given coordinates. The possible outcomes are 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The program processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results in the order they were received.

The program's logic is based on the observation that if Alice's chip is in the same column as Bob's chip, or if the difference in their x-coordinates is even, then Bob wins. Otherwise, Alice wins. The program also checks for the possibility of a draw, which occurs when either player cannot make a move.

The program's structure and logic are clear and well-organized. The use of conditional statements and loops makes the program easy to follow and understand. The program also handles all possible cases and edge cases, ensuring that it produces the correct output for all valid inputs.

However, there are a few minor issues with the program. For example, the variable names could be more descriptive, and some of the conditional statements could be simplified. Additionally, the program does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative integers or non-integer values.

Overall, the program is correct and effectively solves the problem. However, it could be improved with some minor refinements to make it more robust and user-friendly.

Correctness: **True**
