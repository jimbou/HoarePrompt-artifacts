Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is greater than 1. The difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues`, or the difference between the fourth and sixth elements of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of clues remains unchanged, the number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw', the value of i is still 0, and the standard input contains multiple test cases minus two. The properties of the clues list, such as the first element not being 1, the third and fifth elements being either both even or both odd, and the relationships between the elements, are still valid.
