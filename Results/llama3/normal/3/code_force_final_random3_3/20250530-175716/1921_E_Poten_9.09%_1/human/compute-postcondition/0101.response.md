Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice', and an additional 'Alice', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the list `answers` has been updated to include an additional 'Alice' at the end, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the number of test cases in stdin has not changed. The list `clues` still contains integers from the input, and `test_cases` is still greater than 1.
