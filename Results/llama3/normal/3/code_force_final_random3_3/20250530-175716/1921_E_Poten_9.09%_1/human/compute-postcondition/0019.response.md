Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. The current value of the fourth element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the current value of the fifth element of `clues` minus the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw', while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
