Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. test_cases is an integer equal to the number of test cases minus one, answers is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1:
                if clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5
                    ] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Bob')
            elif clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5

The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the current value of `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or the current value of `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the fourth element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the fifth element of `clues` minus the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of half of the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of half of the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2.

Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added to `answers`.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
