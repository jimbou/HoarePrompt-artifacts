Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list of answers now includes an additional 'Draw' result, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in the standard input has not changed, as the code only appends a value to the answers list without consuming any input.
