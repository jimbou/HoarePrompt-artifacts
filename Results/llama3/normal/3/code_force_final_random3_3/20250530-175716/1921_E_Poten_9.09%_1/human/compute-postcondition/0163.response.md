The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and list `answers`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `answers`. If the list has at least 1 answer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 answer and the j is the first answer in the list.
State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' that must have at least 1 answer, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, j is the first answer in the list, stdin is empty**
