Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Bob', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include 'Bob' in addition to its previous values of either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The other variables remain unchanged, with `clues` still being a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` being an integer greater than 1, and `i` being 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
