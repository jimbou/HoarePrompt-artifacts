Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is less than or equal to half the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, and the difference between the sixth element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is less than or equal to half the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice', while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
