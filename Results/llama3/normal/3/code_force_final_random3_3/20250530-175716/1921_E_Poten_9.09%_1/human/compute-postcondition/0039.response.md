Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is greater than 1, then if the difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues`, or the difference between the fourth and sixth elements of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the current value of `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2` or the current value of `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
