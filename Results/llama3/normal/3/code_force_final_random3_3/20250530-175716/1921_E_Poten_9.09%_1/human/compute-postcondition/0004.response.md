Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or the current value of `clues[0]` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include 'Draw' as its first element. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or the current value of `clues[0]` is 1 is still valid.
