Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the list `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw' as its last element, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the number of test cases in the standard input has not changed. The list `clues` still contains integers from the input, and the number of test cases is still greater than 1.
