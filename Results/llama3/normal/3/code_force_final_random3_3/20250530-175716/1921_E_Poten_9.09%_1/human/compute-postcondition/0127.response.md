Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the difference between clues[3] and 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or the difference between clues[5] and clues[3] is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, then 'Draw' is added to the answers list. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to the answers list.***
