Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and also 'Draw' as the last element, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the list `answers` has been updated to include 'Draw' as its last element, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The list `clues` remains a list of integers from the input, and `test_cases` is still an integer greater than 1.
