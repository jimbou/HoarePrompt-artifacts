Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. test_cases is an integer equal to the number of test cases minus one, answers is an empty list.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin, which represents the number of test cases, and assigns it to the variable test_cases. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line initializes an empty list called answers. No other variables are affected.
