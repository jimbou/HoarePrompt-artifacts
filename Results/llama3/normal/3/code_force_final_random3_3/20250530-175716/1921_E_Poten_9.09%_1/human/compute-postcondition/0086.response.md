Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to `answers`.***
