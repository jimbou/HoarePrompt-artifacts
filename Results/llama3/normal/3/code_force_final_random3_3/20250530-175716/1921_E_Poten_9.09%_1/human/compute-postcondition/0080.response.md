The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
