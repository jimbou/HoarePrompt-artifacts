Postcondition: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, 'Draw' is added to `answers` if either `clues[3] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers` if either `clues[3] - 1` or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then 'Draw' is added to `answers` if either `clues[1] - clues[3]` or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than or equal to half the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to `answers`.**
