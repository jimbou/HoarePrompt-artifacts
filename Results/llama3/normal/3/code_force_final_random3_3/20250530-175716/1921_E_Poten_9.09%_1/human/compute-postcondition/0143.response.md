Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include 'Draw' at the end of the list, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `answers` now contains 'Draw' in addition to its previous values of either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The rest of the variables, including `clues`, `test_cases`, `i`, and the contents of stdin, remain the same as in the initial state.
