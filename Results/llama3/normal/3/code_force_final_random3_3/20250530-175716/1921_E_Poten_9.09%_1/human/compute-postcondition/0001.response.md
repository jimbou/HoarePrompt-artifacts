The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If test_cases is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one and test_cases is an integer equal to the number of test cases minus one and answers is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `test_cases` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, test_cases is an integer greater than 0, answers is an empty list, i is 0**
