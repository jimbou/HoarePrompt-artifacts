Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the difference between clues[5] and clues[3] minus the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2 is greater than 1, then 'Draw' is added to the answers list. Otherwise, at least one 'Alice' is added to the answers list.***
