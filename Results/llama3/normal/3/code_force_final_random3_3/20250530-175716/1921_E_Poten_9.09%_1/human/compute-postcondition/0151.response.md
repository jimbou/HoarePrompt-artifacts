Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Alice', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of answers now contains an additional 'Alice' at the end, while the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in the input is still greater than 1, and the value of `i` is still 2. The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus two.
