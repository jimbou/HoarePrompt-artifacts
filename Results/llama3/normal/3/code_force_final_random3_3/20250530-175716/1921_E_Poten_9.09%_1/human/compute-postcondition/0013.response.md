Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. The current value of the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the current value of the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of answers now contains 'Draw', and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
