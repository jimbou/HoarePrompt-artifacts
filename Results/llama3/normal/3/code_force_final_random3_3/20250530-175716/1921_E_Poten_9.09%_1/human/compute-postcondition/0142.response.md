Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice', and an additional 'Alice' at the end, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of answers now includes an additional 'Alice' at the end, while the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases and the list of clues are still the same, and the value of `i` is still 2. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus two.
