The code `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string 'Bob' to the end of the list `answers`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.

Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Bob' is added at the end of the list, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
