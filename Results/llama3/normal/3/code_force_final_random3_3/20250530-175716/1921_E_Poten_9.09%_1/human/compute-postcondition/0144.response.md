Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `answers` now contains one more 'Alice' than before, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include one more 'Alice' than before, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `answers` list now contains at least one 'Alice', in addition to its previous contents, which could be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The other variables, `clues`, `test_cases`, `i`, and stdin, retain their original values and properties.
