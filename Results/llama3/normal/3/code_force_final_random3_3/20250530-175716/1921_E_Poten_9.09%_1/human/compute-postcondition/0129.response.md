Output State: **`clues` is a list of integers from the input, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and an additional 'Bob', `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the list `answers` has been updated to include an additional 'Bob' at the end, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2, and the number of test cases in stdin has not changed. The list `clues` and the integer `test_cases` also retain their original values.
