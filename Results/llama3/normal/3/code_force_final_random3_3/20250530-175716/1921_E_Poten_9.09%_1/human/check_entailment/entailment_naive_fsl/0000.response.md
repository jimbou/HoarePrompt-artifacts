Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the difference in the x-coordinates of Alice and Bob is 1, and the difference in their y-coordinates is also 1. In this case, the program will incorrectly determine the outcome of the game.

For example, if the input is `10 10 2 2 3 3`, the program will output `Draw`, but the correct output should be `Alice`. This is because Alice can move her chip to the cell (3, 3) and win the game.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly consider all possible moves that Alice and Bob can make. It only checks if the difference in their x-coordinates and y-coordinates is even or odd, but it does not take into account the actual positions of their chips on the board.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and its correctness is **False**.
