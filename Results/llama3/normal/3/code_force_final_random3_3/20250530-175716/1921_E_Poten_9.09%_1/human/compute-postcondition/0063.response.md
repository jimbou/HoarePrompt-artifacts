Postcondition: ***`clues` is a list of integers, `test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. The current value of the fifth element of `clues` minus 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the current value of the fourth element of `clues` minus the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.***
