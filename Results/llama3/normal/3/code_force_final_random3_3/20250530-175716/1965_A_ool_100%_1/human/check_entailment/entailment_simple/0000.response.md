Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly determines the winner of the game based on the properties of the input list `arr`. 

The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the number of moves required to empty all piles. 

The program first checks if the smallest pile size is not 1, in which case Alice can win by choosing `k` equal to the smallest pile size. 

If the smallest pile size is 1, the program checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. If this condition is met, the number of moves required to empty all piles is equal to the largest pile size minus the smallest pile size plus 1, which is odd if and only if the length of `set_` is odd. 

In this case, the program returns 'Alice' if the length of `set_` is odd and 'Bob' otherwise. 

If the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are not all 1, the program returns 'Alice' if the length of `set_` is even and 'Bob' otherwise. 

This logic is correct based on the problem description, and the program correctly implements this logic.

Correctness: **True**
