Output State: **The program returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. If the length of set_ is odd and the difference between any two consecutive elements of set_ is not more than 1, then 'Alice' is returned. Otherwise, 'Bob' is returned. The returned value is based on the condition A, which depends on the properties of set_, a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, where the first element is 1.**
