Output State: **A is True if the length of set_ is even, otherwise A is False, not_c is False if the difference between any two consecutive elements of set_ is more than 1, otherwise not_c is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, and i is equal to the length of set_ minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of A will be True if the length of set_ is even, and False if it's odd.
* The value of not_c will be False if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in set_ with a difference greater than 1. Otherwise, it will be True.
* The set_ will remain a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr.
* The arr will remain unchanged.
* The first element of set_ will always be 1.
* The value of i will be equal to the length of set_ minus 1.
