To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `set_`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `set_`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `set_` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

Additionally, since `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers, and the first element is 1, the second element must be 2 or more. If the difference between the current and previous elements of `set_` is 1 or less, `not_c` is True; otherwise, it is False.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **A is True, not_c is True if the difference between the current and previous elements of set_ is 1 or less, otherwise not_c is False. set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, the second element of set_ is 2 or more, and i is 2.**
