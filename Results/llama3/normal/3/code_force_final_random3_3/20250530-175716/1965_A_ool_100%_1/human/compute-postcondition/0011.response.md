Output State: **A is True, not_c is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, the second element of set_ is 2 or more, and i is 2.**

The first line of the code sets the value of `not_c` to `False`. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables as it is used to exit a loop, but there is no loop in the provided code snippet, so it has no effect. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
