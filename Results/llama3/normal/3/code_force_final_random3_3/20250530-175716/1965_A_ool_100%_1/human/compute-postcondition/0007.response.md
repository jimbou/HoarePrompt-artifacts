Output State: **A is False, not_c is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, and i is 1. The current value of set_[i] - set_[i - 1] is greater than 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `not_c = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `not_c`, changing its initial value from `True` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or the nearest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. The variable `A` remains `False`, `set_` remains a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 2 elements and its first element being 1, `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` remains 1. Additionally, the condition that `set_[i] - set_[i - 1]` is greater than 1 is not affected by the code and thus remains true.
