Output State: **A is True, not_c is True if the difference between the current and previous elements of set_ is 1 or less, otherwise not_c is False. set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, and i is 1.**

The code `A = not A` simply flips the value of `A`, so `A` is now `True`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. The value of `not_c` still depends on the difference between the current and previous elements of `set_`, and `set_` is still a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 2 elements, with the first element being 1. The value of `i` is still 1, and `arr` remains unchanged.
