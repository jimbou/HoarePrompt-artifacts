Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the properties of the list of unique positive integers. The function `func_1` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. If the list does not start with 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list are not more than 1. If the length of the list is odd and this condition is met, the function returns 'Alice'; otherwise, it returns 'Bob'. The input list remains unchanged throughout the process.

Correctness: **True**
