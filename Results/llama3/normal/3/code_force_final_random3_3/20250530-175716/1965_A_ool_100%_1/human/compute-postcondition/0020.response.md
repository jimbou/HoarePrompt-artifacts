The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to its opposite. Since `A` is initially `True` if the length of `set_` is even and `False` otherwise, the new value of `A` will be `False` if the length of `set_` is even and `True` otherwise.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged: the difference between any two consecutive elements of `set_` is still not more than 1, `set_` is still a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `arr` remains unchanged, the first element of `set_` is still 1, and `i` is still equal to the length of `set_` minus 1.

Output State: **A is False if the length of set_ is even, otherwise A is True, the difference between any two consecutive elements of set_ is not more than 1, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, and i is equal to the length of set_ minus 1.**
