To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `set_`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `set_`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `set_` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, since `set_` has at least 2 elements, it must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

The state of `A` and `not_c` is not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **A is False, not_c is False if the difference between the current and previous elements of set_ is more than 1, otherwise not_c is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 3 elements, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, the second element of set_ is 2 or more, and i is 3**
