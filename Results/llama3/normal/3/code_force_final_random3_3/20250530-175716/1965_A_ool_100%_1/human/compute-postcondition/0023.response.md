Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on the properties of a list of unique positive integers. The function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. If the list does not start with 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list are not more than 1. If the length of the list is odd and this condition is met, the function returns 'Alice'; otherwise, it returns 'Bob'. The input list remains unchanged throughout the process.**
