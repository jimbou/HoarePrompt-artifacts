Output State: **n is an integer, i is n, arr is a list containing at least n elements, item is the last element of arr, res is a string that is the user's input, maxi is 0, mini is the maximum value of the elements in arr (excluding the first element) if res is not '>', otherwise mini is the last element of arr.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the user's input. The value of `i` remains the same as `n`. The list `arr` and its elements, including the last element `item`, are unchanged. The string `res` remains the user's input. The variable `maxi` has been initialized to 0. The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`: if `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`, otherwise `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element).
