Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `res` is a string containing the input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '=', `item` is the second element in the list, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` which is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item` which is the second element in the list, followed by the value of `item` again.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to contain the input string, which can be either '<', '=', or something else. The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`, and is either `n-1` or 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The specified string has been printed, with the values of `mini` and `item` inserted into it.
