Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `maxi` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` equals '<', then ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] has been printed. If `res` does not equal '<', then ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variables `n`, `i`, `res`, and `maxi` retain their initial values, and a new list `arr` is created with a single element 0. The printed output remains the same, with the additional information that `maxi` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, and the corresponding values have been printed.
