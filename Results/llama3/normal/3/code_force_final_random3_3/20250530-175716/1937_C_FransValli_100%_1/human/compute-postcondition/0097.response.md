To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1. The state of `i` should be adjusted to be the starting value of the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n', `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`.**
