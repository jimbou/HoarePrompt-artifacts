Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `item` is the next element in the list after the current `item`, `res` is a string that is the user's input, and the printed output is still '?' followed by the value of `mini` twice, followed by the value of `item` twice, with the `flush=True` argument ensuring the output is immediately displayed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `item` remain unchanged. The new variable `res` is assigned the user's input as a string. The printed output remains the same, with the value of `mini` and `item` displayed twice, followed by the user's input.
