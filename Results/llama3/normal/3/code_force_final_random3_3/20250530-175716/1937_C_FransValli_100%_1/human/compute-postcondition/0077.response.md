The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `maxi` (twice), and the value of `i` (twice), followed by the `flush=True` argument which forces the output buffer to be flushed immediately.

Since the exact value of `maxi` is not provided in the precondition, we can't determine its exact value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current value of `maxi` twice.

The value of `i` is provided in the precondition as 1.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 1 1 (where maxi is the current value of maxi)**
