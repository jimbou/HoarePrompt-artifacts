Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing either two elements 0 and 2 or two elements 1 and 2, `res` is a string, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, and the strings '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' and '? maxi maxi n n' are printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, and the strings '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' and '? maxi maxi n n' are printed.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `res` and `maxi` are still valid, and the strings are printed as specified.
