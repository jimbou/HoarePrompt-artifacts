Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `res` is a string containing the new input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1` if the new input is '<', 0 if the new input is '=', and 0 if the new input is not '<' or '=', `item` is the third element in the list, and the following is printed: '?' , the value of `mini` which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input, the value of `mini` which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input, the value of `item` which is the third element in the list `arr` , and the value of `item` which is the third element in the list `arr`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been updated to the new input from the user. The value of `mini` depends on the new input, if it is '<' then `mini` is `n-1`, if it is '=' then `mini` is 0, otherwise `mini` is 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `maxi`, and `item` remain the same. The same values are printed as before, but now the value of `mini` is based on the new input.
