Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is the user's new input, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element) if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the last element of `arr`, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the user's new input, and the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mini` still depends on the value of `res`, and the stdin is now empty since it has been used to get the user's input.
