Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)`

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `!`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. `maxi`: The value of `maxi` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, it is likely that `maxi` is the maximum value of the elements in the list `arr`. Since `arr` contains at least `n` elements, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `maxi` will be the maximum value of the elements in `arr`.
3. `mini`: The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `mini`. However, we can describe its value based on the condition.
4. `flush=True`: This is a keyword argument that controls the buffering behavior of the print statement. It does not affect the output.

Based on the above analysis, the output will be:

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the maximum value of the elements in arr, and mini is either the last element of arr if res equals '>', or the maximum value of the elements in arr excluding the first element, otherwise)**
