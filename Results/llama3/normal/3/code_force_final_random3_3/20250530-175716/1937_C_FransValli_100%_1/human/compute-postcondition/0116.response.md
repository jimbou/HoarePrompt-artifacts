To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for i in range(1, n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0, a single element 1, two elements 0 and 2, or two elements 1 and 2, `res` is a string, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, and the strings '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' and '? maxi maxi n n' are printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, and the strings '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' and '? maxi maxi n n' are printed. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing either two elements 0 and 2 or two elements 1 and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1.**
