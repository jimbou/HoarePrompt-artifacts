Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`

From the precondition, we know:

* `mini` is 0
* `item` is the second element of `arr`

Since `arr` is a list containing at least two elements, we can assume that the second element of `arr` has a value, but we don't know what that value is. Let's call it `[second element of arr]`.

Now, let's substitute the values into the print statement:

`print('?', 0, 0, [second element of arr], [second element of arr], flush=True)`

The `flush=True` argument is a keyword argument that controls the buffering behavior of the print function, but it doesn't affect the output.

So, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 [second element of arr] [second element of arr]**
