Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, item is the third element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and if `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the second element in the list. The following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and if `res` equals '>', then this is printed: ? [item] [item] [item] [item], otherwise this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item].***
