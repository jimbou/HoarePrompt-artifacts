Based on the precondition, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)`

Here's what we know:

* `res` is a string that is the input from the user.
* If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is 1. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0.
* `i` is 2.

Now, let's consider the possible values of `maxi`:

* If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is 1.
* If `res` does not equal '<', then `maxi` is 0.

Since we don't know the exact value of `res`, we can't determine the exact value of `maxi`. However, we can describe its possible values.

The print statement will print:

* '?' (a literal string)
* `maxi` (which is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `res`)
* `maxi` again (which is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `res`)
* `i` (which is 2)
* `i` again (which is 2)

So, the output will be either:

`? 1 1 2 2` (if `res` equals '<')

or

`? 0 0 2 2` (if `res` does not equal '<')

We can't provide a single exact output, but we can describe the possible outputs based on the precondition.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where maxi is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of res)**
