Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n', `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, `arr` is a list containing either one element 0 or two elements 0 and 1, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. In both cases, stdin contains one input: a string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0, a single element 1, two elements 0 and 2, or two elements 1 and 2, `res` is a string, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, and the strings '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' and '? maxi maxi n n' are printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, and the strings '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' and '? maxi maxi n n' are printed. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing either two elements 0 and 2 or two elements 1 and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string that is either '<', '=', or something else, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n` and `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If `res` is '=', then `maxi` is not `n` and `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 and 3, a single element 1 and 3, three elements 0, 2 and 3, or three elements 1, 2 and 3. If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', then `maxi` is not `n` and `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0, a single element 1, two elements 0 and 2, or two elements 1 and 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
