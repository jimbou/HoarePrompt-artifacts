The code prints a string that starts with '?', followed by the value of `maxi`, then the first element of the list `arr`, then the value of `maxi` again, then the value of `i`, and finally the value of `flush` which is set to `True`.

The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `maxi` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`.

The first element of the list `arr` also depends on the value of `res`. If `res` equals '<', then `arr` contains a single element 1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` contains two elements 0 and 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains a single element 0.

The value of `i` is given as 2.

Since `flush` is set to `True`, the output will be printed immediately.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where maxi is n-1 if res equals '<', otherwise maxi is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of res, and arr[0] is 1 if res equals '<', otherwise arr[0] is 0 if res is '=', otherwise arr[0] is 0)**
