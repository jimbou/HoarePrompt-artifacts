The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, `arr` is a list containing either one element 0 or two elements 0 and 1, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. In both cases, stdin contains one input: a string.**
