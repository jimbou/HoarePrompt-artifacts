Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1, `res` is a string, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, `arr` is a list containing either one element 0 or two elements 0 and 1, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. In both cases, the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated to be a string from the input, and the stdin is empty since the input has been consumed. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
