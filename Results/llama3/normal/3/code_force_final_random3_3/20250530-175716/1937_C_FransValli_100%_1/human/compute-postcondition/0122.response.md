Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0, a single element 1, two elements 0 and 2, or two elements 1 and 2, `res` is a string that is either '<', '=', or something else, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing either two elements 0 and 2 or two elements 1 and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 and 3, a single element 1 and 3, three elements 0, 2 and 3, or three elements 1, 2 and 3.***
