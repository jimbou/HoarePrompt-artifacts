According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` and `item`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string containing the input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '=', `item` is unknown. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the item is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `res` is a string containing the input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '=', `item` is the second element in the list**
