Based on the precondition, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`

Here's what we know from the precondition:

* `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n'
* If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`
* `arr` is a list containing a single element 0
* `i` is 1

Since the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed, we can infer that `res` is indeed '? maxi maxi n n'. Therefore, `maxi` is not necessarily equal to `n`.

Now, let's substitute the values into the print statement:

* `?` is a literal string
* `maxi` is either `n` or some other value (we don't know exactly, but it's not necessarily `n`)
* `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`, which is 0
* `maxi` is the same value as before (either `n` or some other value)
* `i` is 1

So, the output will be a string that includes the literal `?`, the value of `maxi` (which is either `n` or some other value), the number 0, the value of `maxi` again, and the number 1.

Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where maxi is either n or some other value)**
