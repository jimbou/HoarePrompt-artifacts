The only object in the loop head is variable  item and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 3 elements, item is the third element in the list arr. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the item is the fourth element in the list arr.
State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `res` is a string containing the new input, `maxi` is `n-1`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`, and the following is printed: '?' , the value of `mini` which is the fourth element in the list `arr`, the value of `mini` which is the fourth element in the list `arr`, the value of `item` which is the fourth element in the list `arr` , and the value of `item` which is the fourth element in the list `arr`. If `res` is not '>', `mini` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input, and the following is printed: '?' , the value of `mini` which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input, the value of `mini` which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input, the value of `item` which is the fourth element in the list `arr` , and the value of `item` which is the fourth element in the list `arr`.**
