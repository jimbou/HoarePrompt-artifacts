Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `maxi` is 3, the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` equals '<', then this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]. If `res` does not equal '<', then this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], where maxi is 3 and i is 3, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and printed statements remain the same as in the initial state.
