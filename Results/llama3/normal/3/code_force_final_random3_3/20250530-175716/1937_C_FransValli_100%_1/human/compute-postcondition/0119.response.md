Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0, a single element 1, two elements 0 and 2, or two elements 1 and 2, `res` is a string that is either '<', '=', or something else, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing either two elements 0 and 2 or two elements 1 and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `n`, `i`, and `arr` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `res` is now a string that is either '<', '=', or something else, which was read from the input. The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`: if `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`; otherwise, `maxi` is not `n`. The composition of `arr` also depends on the value of `res`: if `res` is '=', then `arr` contains two elements; otherwise, `arr` contains a single element.
