Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi 1 1', and this is printed: ? maxi maxi 1 1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1. The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is either 1 or unknown, followed by the value of `maxi` which is either 1 or unknown, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, is being printed and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to either '<' or '? maxi maxi 1 1', which is the input from the user. The values of `n` and `i` remain the same. The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is either 1 or unknown, followed by the value of `maxi` which is either 1 or unknown, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, is being printed. The stdin contains no input because the input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
