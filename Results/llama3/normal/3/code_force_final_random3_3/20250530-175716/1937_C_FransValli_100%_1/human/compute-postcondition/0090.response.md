Based on the precondition, the value of `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi 1 1'. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2. However, the print statement is printing '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is 2, followed by the value of `maxi` which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3.

Since the print statement is printing '?' regardless of the value of `res`, the output will always start with '?'.

The value of `maxi` is 2, so it will be printed twice.

The value of `i` is 3, so it will be printed twice.

Therefore, the output will be '?' followed by 2, 2, 3, and 3.

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
