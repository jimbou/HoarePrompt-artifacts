Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. `maxi` is not `n`, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], stdin contains one input: a string.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the current value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The string '? maxi maxi n n' is still printed, and `maxi` is still not equal to `n`. The string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is also still printed, with `arr[0]` being 0 and `i` being 1. The stdin still contains one input: a string.
