To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `item` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least two elements. Since `arr` currently contains a single element 0, we need to add at least one more element to it. We also need to set `item` to the second element of `arr`, which is currently non-existent.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n', `arr` is a list containing at least two elements, `mini` is 0, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, `item` is the second element of `arr`**
