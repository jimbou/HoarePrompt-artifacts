Output State: **n is an integer equal to the new input from the user, i is n, res is a string that is the new input from the user, arr is a list containing at least n-1 elements, item is the last element in the list, maxi is 0, mini is n-1 if the previous res equals '<', otherwise it is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of the previous res, and _ is the new input from the user**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the new input from the user, and `i` is still equal to `n`. The value of `res` is also updated to the new input from the user. The list `arr` remains unchanged, and `item` is still the last element in the list. The value of `maxi` has been reset to 0. The value of `mini` depends on the previous value of `res`: if it was '<', then `mini` is `n-1`; otherwise, it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`. The value of `_` is also updated to the new input from the user.
