Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is a string that is the input from the user, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The variable `res` is assigned the value of the input from the user, which is a string. The printed output remains the same as it was not modified by the code.
