Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is a list containing a single element `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then `n-2` and then `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then `n-2`, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their previous values except for `mini`, which is now assigned the value of the first element of the list `arr`. The value of `mini` depends on the previous value of `res`. If the previous `res` was '<', then `mini` is `n-1`. If the previous `res` was '=', then `mini` is `n-2`. Otherwise, `mini` is 0. All other variables and printed outputs remain the same as in the initial state.
