Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `maxi` is initialized to 0.
* `i` is initialized to 1.
* The print statement uses the `flush=True` argument, which means that the output will be immediately flushed to the output buffer, but it doesn't affect the actual output.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)`

The print statement will output the following:

* A literal question mark (`?`)
* The value of `maxi`, which is 0
* The value of `maxi` again, which is still 0
* The value of `i`, which is 1
* The value of `i` again, which is still 1

So, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
