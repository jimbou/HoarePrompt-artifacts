Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `res` is a string containing the new input, `maxi` is `n-1`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. If `res` is not '>', `mini` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input. stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the new input from the user. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `maxi` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. If `res` is not '>', `mini` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input. The stdin is now empty as the input has been consumed.
