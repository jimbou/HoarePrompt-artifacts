The code prints a string with a question mark followed by the values of `maxi` and `i`. The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is 1; otherwise, `maxi` is 0. The value of `i` is 3.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is 1 if res equals '<', otherwise maxi is 0, and i is 3)**
