Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<', a list containing `n` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` if `res` is '=', and a list containing `n-1` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` if `res` is not '<' or '=', `res` is a string containing the input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '=', `item` is unknown.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `res` is a string containing the input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '=', `item` is the second element in the list. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the second element in the list and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` which is the second element in the list, followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item` which is the second element in the list, followed by the value of `item` again. Otherwise, `mini` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res` and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` which is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item` which is the second element in the list, followed by the value of `item` again.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `res` is a string containing the new input, `maxi` is `n-1`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the third element in the list `arr`, and the following is printed: '?' , the value of `mini` which is the third element in the list `arr`, the value of `mini` which is the third element in the list `arr`, the value of `item` which is the third element in the list `arr` , and the value of `item` which is the third element in the list `arr`. If `res` is not '>', `mini` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input, and the following is printed: '?' , the value of `mini` which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input, the value of `mini` which is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input, the value of `item` which is the third element in the list `arr` , and the value of `item` which is the third element in the list `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `maxi` is `n-1`. If `res` is '>', `mini` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. If `res` is not '>', `mini` is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of the new input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
