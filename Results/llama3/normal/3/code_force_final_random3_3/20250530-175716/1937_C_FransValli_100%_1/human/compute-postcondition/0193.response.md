The value of `res` is updated to the input string, which can be either '<', '=' or another string. The value of `arr` is updated based on the value of `res`. The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is `n-1`, the first element of `arr` which is 2 if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 1 if the input is '<', 0 if the input is not '<' or '=', the value of `maxi` which is `n-1` again, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed.
