Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing a single element 3, `res` is a string that is either '<', '=', or something else, `maxi` is either `n` or not `n`**.

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being greater than 3, `res` still being either '<', '=', or something else, and `maxi` still being either `n` or not `n` depending on the value of `res`.
