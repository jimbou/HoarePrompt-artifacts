The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `res` is a string that is the input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if `res` equals '<', otherwise it is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0, `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed. stdin contains no input.**
