Output: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, `arr` is a list containing either one element 0 or two elements 0 and 1, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. In both cases, stdin contains one input: a string. and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `maxi` followed by the first element of the list `arr` followed by the value of `maxi` followed by the value of `i`**
