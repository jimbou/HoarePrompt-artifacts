Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `res` is a string containing the input and its current value is '>', `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is the second element in the list, `item` is the second element in the list, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` which is the second element in the list, followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item` which is the second element in the list, followed by the value of `item` again.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the second element in the list, which is the same as the value of `item`. The other variables remain unchanged. The print statement still shows the same output, but now the value of `mini` is the second element in the list, not 0.
