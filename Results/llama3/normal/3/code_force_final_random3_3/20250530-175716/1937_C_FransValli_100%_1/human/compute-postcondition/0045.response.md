Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element 2 if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 1 if the new `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2, `maxi` is `n-1` if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the new `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the new input from the user has been read and stored in the variable `res`. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the same print statements have been executed.
