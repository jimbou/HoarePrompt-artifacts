Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is '<' or `res` is not '<'. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: ? 1 1 2 2, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is either '<' or not '<'. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the string "? 1 1 2 2" is printed. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `item` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin contains no input.
