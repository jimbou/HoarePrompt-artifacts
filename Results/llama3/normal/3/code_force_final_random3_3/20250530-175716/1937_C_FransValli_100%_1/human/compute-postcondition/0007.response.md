Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 1, `res` is a string that is the input from the user and equals '<', and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `maxi`. Since `i` is 1, `maxi` is now 1. The values of the other variables, `n` and `res`, remain unchanged, as well as the printed output.
