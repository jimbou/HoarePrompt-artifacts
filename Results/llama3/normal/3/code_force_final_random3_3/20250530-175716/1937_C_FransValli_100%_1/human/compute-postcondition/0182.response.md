State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `mini` is unknown. If the input is '<', then `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, and `res` is a string containing the input '<'. If the input is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements: 0 and 1, and `res` is a string containing the input '='. If the input is not '<' or '=', then `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and `res` is a string containing the input. In all cases, `item` is unknown, and this is printed: ? (n-1) 0 (n-1) 1**
