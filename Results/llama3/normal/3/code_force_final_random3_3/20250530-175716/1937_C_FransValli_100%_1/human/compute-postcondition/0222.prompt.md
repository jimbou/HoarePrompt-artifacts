Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). Each test case contains one input: an integer (n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least `n-1` elements, `item` is the last element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, and `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and if `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list. The following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and for each element in `arr` starting from the second element, this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and if `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the current element in the list, and this is printed: ! [maxi] [mini]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is the user's input, `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element), the string '? maxi maxi n n' was printed. If `res` equals to '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element), and this is printed: '!', maxi, mini

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing `n` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` if `res` is '=', a list containing `n-1` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` if `res` is not '<' or '=', and a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '=', `item` is the last element in the list, and the following is printed: '!', maxi which is n-1, and mini which is n-1 if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '='




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
