Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing `n` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` if `res` is '=', a list containing `n-1` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` if `res` is not '<' or '=', and a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<', `res` is a string containing the input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `n-1` if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '=', `item` is the last element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains the same, and `i` is still equal to `n`.
*   The list `arr` contains either `n` elements (0 to `n-1`) if the input `res` is '=', `n-1` elements (0 to `n-2`) if `res` is not '<' or '=', or a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<'.
*   The variable `res` holds the input string.
*   The maximum value `maxi` is `n-1`.
*   The minimum value `mini` depends on the input `res`: it is `n-1` if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 0 if `res` is not '<' or '='.
*   The variable `item` is the last element in the list `arr`.
