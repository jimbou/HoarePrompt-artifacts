Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, item is the third element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and if `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the second element in the list, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and if `res` equals '>', then this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated to the new input from the user, and if `res` equals '>', then the value of `mini` has been updated to the second element in the list. The values of the other variables remain the same. The same print statements have been executed as before, with the updated values of `res` and `mini`.
