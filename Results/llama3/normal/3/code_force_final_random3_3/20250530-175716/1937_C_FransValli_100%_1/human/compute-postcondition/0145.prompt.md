Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n', `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `mini` is 0, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least two elements. If `res` is '>', then `res` is '>', `mini` is the value of `item`, `maxi` is not necessarily `n`, `item` is not necessarily the second element of `arr`, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' was printed. The string '? 0 0 [item] [item]' was not printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, `item` is the second element of `arr`, and the string '? 0 0 [item] [item]' was printed. In either case, the string '? maxi maxi n n' was printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `item` is the next element in the list after the current `item`, `res` is a string that is the user's input. If `res` equals to '>', then `mini` is the current `item`, and the printed output is '?' followed by the value of `item` twice, followed by the value of `item` twice, with the `flush=True` argument ensuring the output is immediately displayed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `item` is the next element in the list after the current `item`. If the user's input `res` is '>', then `mini` is equal to `item`, and '?' followed by the value of `item` (twice) and the value of `item` (twice) is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
