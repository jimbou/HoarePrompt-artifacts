The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains at least one input, which is an integer greater than 0, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line initializes `maxi` to 0.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, maxi is 0, stdin is empty**
