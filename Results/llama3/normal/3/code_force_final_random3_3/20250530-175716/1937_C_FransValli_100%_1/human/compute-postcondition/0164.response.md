The code prints a string with a question mark followed by the values of `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i`. 

Since `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2, and `i` is 3, the print statement will output the string '?' followed by the values of `maxi` (which is 2), `maxi` (which is 2), `i` (which is 3), and `i` (which is 3).

Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
