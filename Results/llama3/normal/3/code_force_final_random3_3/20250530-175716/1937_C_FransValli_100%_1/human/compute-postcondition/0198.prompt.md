Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `item` is unknown, `res` is a string, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `mini` is unknown.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `mini` is unknown. If the input is '<', then `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, and `res` is a string containing the input '<'. If the input is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements: 0 and 1, and `res` is a string containing the input '='. If the input is not '<' or '=', then `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and `res` is a string containing the input. In all cases, `item` is unknown, and this is printed: ? (n-1) 0 (n-1) 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is unknown, `item` is unknown, `res` is a string containing the input. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing three elements: 0, 1 and 2. If `res` is not '<' or '=', `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if the input is '<', a list containing two elements: 0 and 1 if the input is '=', and a list containing a single element 0 if the input is not '<' or '='.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is unknown, `item` is unknown, `res` is either '<', '=' or another string. The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is `n-1`, the first element of `arr` which is 2 if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 1 if the input is '<', 0 if the input is not '<' or '=', the value of `maxi` which is `n-1` again, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing four elements: 0, 1, 2 and 3. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing two elements: 2 and 3 if `res` is '<', a list containing two elements: 1 and 3 if the input is '<', a list containing three elements: 0, 1 and 3 if the input is '=', and a list containing two elements: 0 and 3 if the input is not '<' or '='.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
