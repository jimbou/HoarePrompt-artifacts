To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we can refine the lower bound of `n` to be at least 3, since `i` is now 2.

The states of the other variables, such as `arr`, `item`, `res`, `maxi`, and `mini`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
