Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the input from the user, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is `n-1` and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]. If `res` does not equal '<', then `maxi` is 0 and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], where maxi is either 0 or n-1 depending on the value of res and i is n, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be that `n` remains a positive integer, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `res` will be the last input from the user. The loop will have printed the string `? 0 0 1 1` followed by a series of strings in the format `? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]`, where `maxi` is either 0 or `n-1` depending on the value of `res` and `i` is `n`. The value of `maxi` will be `n-1` if the last input from the user is '<', otherwise it will be 0. The stdin will contain no input.
