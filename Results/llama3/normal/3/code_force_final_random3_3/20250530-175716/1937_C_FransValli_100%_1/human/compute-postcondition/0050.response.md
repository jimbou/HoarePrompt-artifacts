Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` equals '<', otherwise it is a list containing a single element `n-2` if `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then `n-2` and then `n-1` if `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then `n-2`, `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   `n` remains a positive integer.
*   `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
*   `res` is a string that is the input from the user, which may have changed after each iteration.
*   `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` equals '<', otherwise it is a list containing a single element `n-2` if `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then `n-2` and then `n-1` if `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then `n-2`.
*   `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`.
*   The following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`.
