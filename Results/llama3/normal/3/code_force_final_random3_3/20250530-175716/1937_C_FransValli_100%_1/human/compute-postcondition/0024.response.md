The code prints a string that starts with '?', followed by the value of `maxi`, which is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`. Then it prints the first element of the list `arr`, which is 0. After that, it prints the value of `maxi` again, followed by the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **? [n-1 or 0] 0 [n-1 or 0] 1**
