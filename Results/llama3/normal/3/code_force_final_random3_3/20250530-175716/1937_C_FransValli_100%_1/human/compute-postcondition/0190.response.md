To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables `i` and `n`, as they are the only variables that can be adjusted.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the new value.

Therefore, the new state is:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is unknown, `item` is unknown, `res` is a string containing the input. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 2. If `res` is '=', `arr` is a list containing three elements: 0, 1 and 2. If `res` is not '<' or '=', `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if the input is '<', a list containing two elements: 0 and 1 if the input is '=', and a list containing a single element 0 if the input is not '<' or '='.**

Note that the values of `maxi`, `mini`, `item`, `res`, and `arr` remain unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.
