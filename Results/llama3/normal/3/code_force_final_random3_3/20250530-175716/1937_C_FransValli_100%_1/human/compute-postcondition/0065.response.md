The only objects in the loop head are variables  item and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 3 elements, item is the third element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the item is the fourth element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, item is the fourth element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and if `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the second element in the list.**
