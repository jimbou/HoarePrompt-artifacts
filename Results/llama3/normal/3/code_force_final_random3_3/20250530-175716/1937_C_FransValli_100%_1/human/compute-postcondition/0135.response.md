Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `item` is the next element in the list after the current `item`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` (which is not explicitly defined in the precondition), followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item`, and finally the value of `item` again, with the `flush=True` argument ensuring the output is immediately displayed**
