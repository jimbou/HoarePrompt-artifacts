Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n', `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `mini` is 0, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to 0, which is the single element in the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that if `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n` still holds. The string '? maxi maxi n n' has been printed, and the values of `n`, `i`, `res`, and `arr` are still the same as in the initial state.
