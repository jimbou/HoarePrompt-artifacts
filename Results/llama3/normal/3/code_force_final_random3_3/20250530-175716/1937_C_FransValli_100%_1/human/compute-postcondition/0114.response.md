Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0, a single element 1, two elements 0 and 2, or two elements 1 and 2, `res` is a string, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, and the strings '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' and '? maxi maxi n n' are printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, and the strings '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' and '? maxi maxi n n' are printed. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing either two elements 0 and 2 or two elements 1 and 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 or a single element 1.***
