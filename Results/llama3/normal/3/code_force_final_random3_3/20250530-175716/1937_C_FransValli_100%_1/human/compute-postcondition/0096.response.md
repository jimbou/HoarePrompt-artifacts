Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n', `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `res`, and the printed string remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `arr`, which is assigned a list containing a single element 0. The conditional relationship between `res` and `maxi` also remains valid.
