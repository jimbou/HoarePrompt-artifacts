To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, it must also be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `res` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi 1 1'. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2. The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is 2, followed by the value of `maxi` which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, followed by the value of `i` which is 3, is being printed and stdin contains no input.**
