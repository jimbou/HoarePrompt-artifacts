Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum and minimum values in the secret sequence, which are then used to find the pair of indices that maximize the bitwise XOR operation.

The program first finds the maximum value in the sequence by comparing each element with the current maximum. It then finds the minimum value among the elements that have the same maximum value as the maximum element found earlier. This is done by comparing each element with the current minimum.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple pairs of indices that maximize the bitwise XOR operation.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples I thought of work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
