To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop iteration.

The other variables, `arr`, `item`, `res`, `maxi`, and `mini`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: ? 1 1 2 2, stdin contains no input.**
