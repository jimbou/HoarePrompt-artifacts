Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least `n-1` elements, `item` is the last element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, and `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and if `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list. The following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and for each element in `arr` starting from the second element, this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and if `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the current element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `arr` starting from the second element, and for each element, it has printed a string in the format `? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]` and read the new input from the user. If the input is '>', then `mini` is updated to the current element in the list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
