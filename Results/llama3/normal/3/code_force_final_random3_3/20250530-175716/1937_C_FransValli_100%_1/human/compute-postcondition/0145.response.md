Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least `n` elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is the user's input, `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element), and the string '? maxi maxi n n' was printed. If `res` equals to '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the list `arr` contains at least `n` elements, and the variable `item` is the last element of `arr`. The variable `res` is the user's input, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If the user's input `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). The string '? maxi maxi n n' was printed at the beginning of the loop.
