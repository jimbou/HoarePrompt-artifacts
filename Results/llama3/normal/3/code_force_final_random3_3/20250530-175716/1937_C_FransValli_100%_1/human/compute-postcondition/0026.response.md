Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `res` is a string that is the input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `maxi` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` equals '<', then ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] has been printed. If `res` does not equal '<', then ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed. stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be the input from the user, which can be any string. The other variables remain unchanged, and the printed output has been updated accordingly based on the value of `res`.
