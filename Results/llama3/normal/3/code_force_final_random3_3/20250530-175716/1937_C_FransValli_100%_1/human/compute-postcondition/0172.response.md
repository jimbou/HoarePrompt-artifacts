The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `maxi` which is `n-1`, the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, the value of `maxi` again which is `n-1`, and the value of `i` which is 1. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is displayed immediately.

Output: **? n-1 0 n-1 1**
