Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least two elements. If `res` is '>', then `res` is '>', `mini` is the value of `item`, `maxi` is not necessarily `n`, `item` is not necessarily the second element of `arr`, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' was printed. The string '? 0 0 [item] [item]' was not printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, `item` is the second element of `arr`, and the string '? 0 0 [item] [item]' was printed. In either case, the string '? maxi maxi n n' was printed.***
