To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, its initial value should be 1, which is the starting point of the range.

The other variables, such as `arr`, `item`, `res`, `maxi`, and `mini`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is the user's input, `maxi` is 0, `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element) if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the last element of `arr`**
