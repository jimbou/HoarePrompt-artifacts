Based on the precondition, the print statement will print an exclamation mark (!) followed by the values of `maxi` and `mini`.

The value of `maxi` depends on the previous value of `res`. If the previous `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `maxi` is either `n-1` or 0, depending on the value of the previous `res`.

The value of `mini` also depends on the previous value of `res`. If the previous `res` equals '<', then `mini` is `n-1`. If the previous `res` equals '=', then `mini` is `n-2`. If the previous `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the last element in the list.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `maxi` and `mini`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `maxi` and `mini` based on the previous value of `res`.

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi and mini are the values of maxi and mini based on the previous value of res)**
