Output State: **The loop has executed for a number of times equal to the number of test cases, which is a positive integer. For each test case, the maximum and minimum values of a list of integers have been found and printed. The list contains integers from 0 to n-1, where n is the input for each test case. The maximum value is the last element in the list, and the minimum value is the first element in the list. The loop has printed the maximum and minimum values for each test case.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed for a number of times equal to the number of test cases, and for each test case, it has found and printed the maximum and minimum values of a list of integers. The list contains integers from 0 to n-1, where n is the input for each test case. The maximum value is the last element in the list, and the minimum value is the first element in the list. The loop has printed the maximum and minimum values for each test case.
