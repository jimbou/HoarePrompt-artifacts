Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is unknown, `item` is unknown, `res` is a string containing the input, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if the input is '<', a list containing two elements: 0 and 1 if the input is '=', and a list containing a single element 0 if the input is not '<' or '='.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still 2, and `maxi` is still `n-1`. The value of `mini` and `item` is still unknown. The value of `res` is updated to be a string containing the input. The value of `arr` is updated based on the input: if the input is '<', `arr` contains a single element 1; if the input is '=', `arr` contains two elements: 0 and 1; if the input is not '<' or '=', `arr` contains a single element 0.
