Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1, `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element), and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and stdin still contains no input.
