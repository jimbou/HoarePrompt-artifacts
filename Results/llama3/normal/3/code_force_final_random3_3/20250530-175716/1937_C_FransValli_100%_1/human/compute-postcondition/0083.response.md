The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi 1 1', and this is printed: ? maxi maxi 1 1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1.**
