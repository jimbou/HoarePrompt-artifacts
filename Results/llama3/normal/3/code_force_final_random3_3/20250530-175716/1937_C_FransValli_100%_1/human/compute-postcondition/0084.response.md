Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi 1 1', and it is printed as '? maxi maxi 1 1'. This means that `res` is currently '? maxi maxi 1 1'.
* If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1. However, since `res` is currently '? maxi maxi 1 1', we can conclude that `maxi` is not necessarily 1.
* The print statement is `print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)`. This will print the string '?' followed by the values of `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i`.

Since `i` is 2, the output will be:

Output: **? maxi maxi 2 2**

Note that we cannot determine the exact value of `maxi` based on the given information, so we leave it as `maxi` in the output.
