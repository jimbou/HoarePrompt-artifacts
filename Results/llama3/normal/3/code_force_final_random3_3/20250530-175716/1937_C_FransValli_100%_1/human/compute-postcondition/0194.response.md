Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is unknown, `item` is unknown, `res` is either '<', '=' or another string, `arr` is a list containing a single element 3.**

The code changes the value of `arr` to a list containing a single element, which is the current value of `i`, i.e., 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state's conditions for `n`, `i`, `maxi`, `mini`, `item`, and `res` are still valid, but the value of `arr` is updated to a list containing a single element 3.
