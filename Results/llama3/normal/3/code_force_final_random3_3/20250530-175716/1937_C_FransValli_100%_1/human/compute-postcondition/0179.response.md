The code `arr.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `arr`. Since `i` is 1, the list `arr` now contains two elements: 0 and 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing two elements: 0 and 1, `item` is unknown, `res` is a string containing the input and equals to '=', `maxi` is `n-1`, and `mini` is unknown, and this is printed: ? (n-1) 0 (n-1) 1**
