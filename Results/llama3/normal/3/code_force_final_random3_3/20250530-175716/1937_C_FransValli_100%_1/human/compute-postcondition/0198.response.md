Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<', a list containing `n` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` if `res` is '=', and a list containing `n-1` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` if `res` is not '<' or '=', `res` is a string containing the input, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `mini` is unknown, `item` is unknown.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is now equal to `n`, and the value of `maxi` remains `n-1`. The value of `res` is a string containing the input. The list `arr` contains either a single element `n-1` if the input is '<', `n` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1` if the input is '=', or `n-1` elements: 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-2` if the input is not '<' or '='.

Note that the value of `mini` and `item` remains unknown as they are not affected by the loop.
