Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi 1 1', `maxi` is 2, and this is printed: ? maxi maxi 1 1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1. The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is 2, followed by the value of `maxi` which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, is being printed and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables, `n`, `i`, and `res`, remain unchanged. The printed string also reflects the new value of `maxi`. Note that if `res` is '<', then `maxi` is still 1, but this is not the case here since `maxi` has been updated to 2.
