Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing a single element 2, `res` is a string, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed. In both cases, the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for printing the strings are still dependent on the value of `res`.
