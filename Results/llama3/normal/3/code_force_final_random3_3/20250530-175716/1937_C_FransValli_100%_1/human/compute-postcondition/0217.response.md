Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `res` is a string containing the new input, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is `item`**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to `item`, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The precondition that `n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `res` is a string containing the new input, and `maxi` is `n-1` still holds true. The only change is that `mini` is now equal to `item`.
