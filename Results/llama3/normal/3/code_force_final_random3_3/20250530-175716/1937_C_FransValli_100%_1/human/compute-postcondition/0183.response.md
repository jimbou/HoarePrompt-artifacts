Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `maxi` is `n-1`, where `n` is at least 3. So, `maxi` is at least 2.
* `arr[0]` is the first element of the list `arr`. Depending on the input, `arr` can be one of three lists: `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, or `[0]`. Since we don't know the exact input, we can't determine the exact value of `arr[0]`. However, we can describe it as "the first element of the list `arr`".
* `i` is 2.

Now, let's construct the output:

Output: **? (n-1) (the first element of the list arr) (n-1) 2**

Note that we've replaced `maxi` with `n-1` to make the output more descriptive, and we've described `arr[0]` as "the first element of the list `arr`" since we can't determine its exact value.
