Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is unknown, `item` is unknown, `res` is a string containing the input, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 and 2 if the input is '<', a list containing three elements: 0, 1 and 2 if the input is '=', and a list containing two elements: 0 and 2 if the input is not '<' or '='.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains an additional element, 2, based on the initial value of `arr` determined by the input.
