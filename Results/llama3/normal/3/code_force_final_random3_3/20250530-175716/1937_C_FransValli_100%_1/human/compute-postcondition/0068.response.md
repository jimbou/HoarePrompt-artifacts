Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and if `res` equals '>', then `mini` is the second element in the list, and the following string is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` which is either `n-1` or `n-2` or 0 or the second element in the list, followed by the value of `mini` again, followed by the value of `item` which is the fourth element in the list, followed by the value of `item` again, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `res` has been updated to the new input from the user, and the other variables remain unchanged. The string printed is a combination of the values of `mini` and `item`, which depend on the previous value of `res`. The stdin is now empty after accepting the new input.
