Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is a string. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: ? 2 2 3 3, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still 3, `arr` is still a list containing at least n elements, and `item` is still the last element of `arr`. The value of `res` is now a string that was input by the user. If the input string is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If the input string is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the string "? 2 2 3 3" is printed. The stdin is now empty, meaning it contains no input.
