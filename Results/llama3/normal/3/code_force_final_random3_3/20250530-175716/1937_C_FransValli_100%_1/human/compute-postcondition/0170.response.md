Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `item` is unknown, `res` is a string, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `mini` is unknown.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element 0. The values of `item` and `mini` are unknown because the original list `arr` has been replaced, and the new list does not provide enough information to determine their values. The other variables remain unchanged.
