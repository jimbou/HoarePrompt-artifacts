Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is 1 and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]. If `res` does not equal '<', then `maxi` is 0 and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]. The following is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], where maxi is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of res and i is 3, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains a positive integer greater than 3, and the value of `i` remains 3. The value of `res` is updated to the new input from the user. The printed output remains the same, with the addition of the new input `res` being either '<' or not '<', which determines the value of `maxi` and the subsequent printed output. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed.
