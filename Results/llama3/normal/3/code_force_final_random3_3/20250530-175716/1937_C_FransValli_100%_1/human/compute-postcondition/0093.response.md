Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is '? 2 2 3 3', `maxi` is 3, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The values of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and `res`, remain unchanged. Since there is no input in stdin, it remains empty.
