Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `item` is the next element in the list after the current `item`. If the user's input `res` is '>', then `mini` is equal to `item`, and '?' followed by the value of `item` (twice) and the value of `item` (twice) is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
