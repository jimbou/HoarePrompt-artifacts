The only objects in the loop head are variables  item and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, i is n, res is a string that is the new input from the user, maxi is n-1 if the previous res equals '<', otherwise it is either n-1 or 0 depending on the value of the previous res, mini is n-1 if the previous res equals '<', otherwise it is n-2 if the previous res equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous res equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in res. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the item is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, item is the second element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`.**
