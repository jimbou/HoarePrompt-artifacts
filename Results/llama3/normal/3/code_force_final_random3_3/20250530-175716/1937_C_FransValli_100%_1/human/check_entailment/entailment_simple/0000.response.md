Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the interactive problem's requirements and finds the maximum XOR value between any two indices in the secret sequence.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The outer loop iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it finds the maximum value in the sequence by comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done using the `?` queries, where it compares the bitwise OR of the current maximum with itself and the bitwise OR of the current element with itself. If the result is `<`, it updates the maximum value.
3. Once the maximum value is found, it creates a list of elements that have the same maximum value. This is done by comparing the bitwise OR of the maximum value with each element. If the result is `=`, it adds the element to the list.
4. Then, it finds the minimum value in the list by comparing each element with the current minimum. This is done using the `?` queries, where it compares the bitwise OR of the current minimum with itself and the bitwise OR of the current element with itself. If the result is `>`, it updates the minimum value.
5. Finally, it prints the maximum and minimum values using the `!` query.

The program uses at most 3n queries, as required by the problem statement. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple pairs of indices with the maximum XOR value.

Correctness: **True**
