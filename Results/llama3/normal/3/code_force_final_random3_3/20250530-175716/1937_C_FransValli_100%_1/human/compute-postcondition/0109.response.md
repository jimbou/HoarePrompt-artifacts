The code prints a string that includes several variables: `maxi`, `arr[0]`, and `i`. The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`, which is greater than 2. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is not `n`. The value of `arr[0]` is either 0 or 1, depending on the contents of the list `arr`. The value of `i` is 2.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where maxi is either n or not n, and arr[0] is either 0 or 1)**
