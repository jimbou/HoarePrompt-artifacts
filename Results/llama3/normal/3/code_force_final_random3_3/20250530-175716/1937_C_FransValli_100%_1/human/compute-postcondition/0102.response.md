Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is '<', `maxi` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed, and the string '? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]' is printed, stdin contains one input: a string.**

The code changes the value of `arr` to a list containing a single element `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed strings are still the same, and the stdin still contains one input: a string.
