According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. 
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `item` is unknown, `res` is a string, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `mini` is unknown**
