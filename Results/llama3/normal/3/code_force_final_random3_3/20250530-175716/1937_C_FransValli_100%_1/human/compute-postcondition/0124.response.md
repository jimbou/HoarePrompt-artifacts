Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n', `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and the string '? maxi maxi n n' is printed. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the exception that `i` is now equal to `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, so after the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`. The other variables, `res`, `arr`, and `maxi`, remain unchanged.
