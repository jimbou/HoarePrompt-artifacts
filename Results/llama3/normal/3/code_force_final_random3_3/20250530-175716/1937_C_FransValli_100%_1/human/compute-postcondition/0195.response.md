Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `maxi` is `n-1`, `mini` is unknown, `item` is unknown, `res` is either '<', '=' or another string, `arr` is a list containing two elements: 2 and 3 if `res` is '<', a list containing four elements: 0, 1, 2 and 3 if `res` is '=', a list containing two elements: 1 and 3 if the input is '<', a list containing three elements: 0, 1 and 3 if the input is '=', and a list containing two elements: 0 and 3 if the input is not '<' or '='.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 3, to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is `n-1`, the first element of `arr` which is 2 if `res` is '<', 0 if `res` is '=', and 1 if the input is '<', 0 if the input is not '<' or '=', the value of `maxi` which is `n-1` again, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed.
