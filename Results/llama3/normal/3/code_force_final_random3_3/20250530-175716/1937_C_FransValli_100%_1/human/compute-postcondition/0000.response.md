To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `int(input())` represents the number of test cases, we can adjust the state to reflect that the number of test cases is at least 1.

State: **stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases) that is greater than 0**
