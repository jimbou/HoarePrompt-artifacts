The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is 1 and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]. If `res` does not equal '<', then `maxi` is 0 and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i].**
