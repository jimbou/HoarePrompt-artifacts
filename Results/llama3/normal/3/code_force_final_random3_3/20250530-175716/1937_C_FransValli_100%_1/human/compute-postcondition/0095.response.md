Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n', and this is printed: ? maxi maxi n n. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
* The value of `i` is equal to `n`.
* The value of `res` is either '<' or '? maxi maxi n n'.
* The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is `n`, followed by the value of `maxi` which is `n`, followed by the value of `i` which is `n`, followed by the value of `i` which is `n`, is being printed.
* If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is `n`.
