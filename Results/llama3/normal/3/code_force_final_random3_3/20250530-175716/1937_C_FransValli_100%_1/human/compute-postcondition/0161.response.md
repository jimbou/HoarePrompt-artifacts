Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is '<' or `res` is not '<'. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: ? 1 1 2 2, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `res` being '<' or not '<' still holds, and the corresponding values of `maxi` and `mini` are updated accordingly. The stdin remains empty, and the printed output is still '? 1 1 2 2' if `res` is not '<'.
