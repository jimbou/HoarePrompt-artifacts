Output: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: ? 1 1 2 2**
