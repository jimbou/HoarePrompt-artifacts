Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string with the following values:

- `mini`: This is either `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0.
- `mini`: Same as above.
- `item`: This is the third element in the list `arr`.
- `item`: Same as above.

Since the exact values of `n`, `res`, and `arr` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `mini` and `item`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated values.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is either n-1, n-2, or 0 depending on the value of the previous res, and item is the third element in the list arr)**
