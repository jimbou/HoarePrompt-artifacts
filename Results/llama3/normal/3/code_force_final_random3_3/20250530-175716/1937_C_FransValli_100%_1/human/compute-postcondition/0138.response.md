Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `item` is the next element in the list after the current `item`, `res` is a string that is the user's input. If `res` equals to '>', then `mini` is the current `item`, and the printed output is '?' followed by the value of `item` twice, followed by the value of `item` twice, with the `flush=True` argument ensuring the output is immediately displayed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
