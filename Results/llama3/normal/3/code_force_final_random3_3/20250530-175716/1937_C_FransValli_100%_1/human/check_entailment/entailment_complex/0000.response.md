Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the maximum value in the list by comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done in O(n) time complexity.

2. Then, it finds all elements that have the same maximum value as the current maximum. This is also done in O(n) time complexity.

3. After that, it finds the minimum value among the elements that have the same maximum value. This is done in O(n) time complexity.

4. Finally, it prints the maximum and minimum values.

The time complexity of the program is O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(3n), which is within the given limit of 3n queries.

The program correctly finds the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints them.

Correctness: **True**
