The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mini` repeated twice, and the value of `item` repeated twice.

The value of `mini` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `mini` is `n-1`. If `res` is '=', then `mini` is 0. If `res` is not '<' or '=', then `mini` is also 0.

The value of `item` is the second element in the list `arr`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `res`, and `arr` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `mini` and `item`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string with the described format.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is n-1 if res is '<', 0 if res is '=', or 0 if res is not '<' or '=', and item is the second element in the list arr)**
