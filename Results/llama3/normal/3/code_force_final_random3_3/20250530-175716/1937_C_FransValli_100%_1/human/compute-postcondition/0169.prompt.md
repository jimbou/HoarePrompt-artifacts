Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, i is n, arr is a list containing at least n elements, item is the last element of arr, res is a string that is the user's input, maxi is 0, mini is the maximum value of the elements in arr (excluding the first element) if res is not '>', otherwise mini is the last element of arr.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        maxi = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: ? 1 1 2 2, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing at least n elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is a string. If `res` is '<', then `res` is '<', `maxi` is 3, and `mini` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr` (excluding the first element). If `res` is not '<', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and this is printed: ? 2 2 3 3, stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
