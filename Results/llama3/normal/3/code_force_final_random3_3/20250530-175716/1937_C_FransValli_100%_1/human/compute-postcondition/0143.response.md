Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `item` is the next element in the list after the current `item`, `res` is a string that is the user's input, `mini` is equal to `item`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `item` (twice) and the value of `item` (twice), stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be equal to `item`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the print statement has been executed with the values of `mini` and `item`. The stdin remains empty as there is no input.
