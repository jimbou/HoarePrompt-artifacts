To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
