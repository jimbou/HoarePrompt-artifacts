Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing either a single element 0 and 3, a single element 1 and 3, three elements 0, 2 and 3, or three elements 1, 2 and 3, `res` is a string that is either '<', '=', or something else, `maxi` is either `n` or not `n`**.

In this output state, the value of `i` is still 3, and `n` is still greater than 3. The list `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 3. The possible combinations of elements in `arr` are now either a single element 0 and 3, a single element 1 and 3, three elements 0, 2 and 3, or three elements 1, 2 and 3. The value of `res` remains the same, and the relationship between `res` and `maxi` also remains the same.
