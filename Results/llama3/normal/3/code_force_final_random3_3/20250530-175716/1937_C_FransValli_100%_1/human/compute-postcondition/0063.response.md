Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, item is the third element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, `mini` is the third element in the list, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and this is printed: ? [item] [item] [item] [item], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and if `res` equals '>', then this is printed: ? [item] [item] [item] [item].**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to be the third element in the list, which is `item`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The printed output also reflects the updated value of `mini`.
