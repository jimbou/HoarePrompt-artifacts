Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, item is the second element in the list, `maxi` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the previous `res`, `mini` is `n-1` if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise it is `n-2` if the previous `res` equals '=', otherwise it is 0, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the previous `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`, and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been updated to the new input from the user, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The program has read and stored the new input in `res`, and the previous values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `item`, `maxi`, and `mini` are still valid. The program has also printed the new input and the updated values of `maxi` and `mini`.
