Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string that is the input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `maxi` is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` equals '<', then ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] has been printed. If `res` does not equal '<', then ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `res` is a string that is the input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if `res` equals '<', otherwise it is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0, `maxi` is `n-1` if `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed. stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element 2 if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 1 if the new `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2, `maxi` is `n-1` if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the new `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed. stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `res` is a string that is the new input from the user, `arr` is a list containing a single element 3 if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 2 if the new `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2 and then 3 if the new `res` equals '=', otherwise it is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2, `maxi` is `n-1` if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise it is either `n-1` or 0 depending on the value of the new `res`, and the following has been printed: ? 0 0 1 1, ? [n-1] [n-1] [n] [n] if the new `res` equals '<', otherwise ? [0] [0] [n] [n] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [1] has been printed, and ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] has been printed, and the new input has been printed, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i], and the new input has been read and stored in `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
