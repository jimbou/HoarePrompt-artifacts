This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and each subsequent line contains three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). It then classifies each set of three digits into one of three categories: 'STAIRS' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b > c, or 'NONE' otherwise. The function prints the classification for each set of three digits.
