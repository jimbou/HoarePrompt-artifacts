Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the first line of stdin which contains three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. and 'PEAK' is printed**
