Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the first line of stdin which contains three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the first line of the input, which contains three digits between 0 and 9. The remaining `t-2` lines of input are still in the stdin. The conditions for printing 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still valid based on the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
