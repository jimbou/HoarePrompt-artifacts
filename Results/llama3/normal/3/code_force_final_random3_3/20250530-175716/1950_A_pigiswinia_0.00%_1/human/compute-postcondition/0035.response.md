Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the last line of stdin which contains three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), stdin is empty. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the input lines from stdin, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values of the last line of input. The loop has printed 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each line of input based on the conditions in the loop body. The stdin is now empty, and the loop has finished executing.
