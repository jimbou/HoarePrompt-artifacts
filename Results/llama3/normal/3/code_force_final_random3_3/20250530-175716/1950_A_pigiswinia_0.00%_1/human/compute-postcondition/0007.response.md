Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). Additionally, either `a` is not less than `b`, or `b` is not less than `c`, or both. The current value of `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.***
