To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of `a`, `b`, `c`, and stdin are not modified in the loop head, so they remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the first line of stdin which contains three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
