Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining inputs in stdin are still present, containing t lines, each with three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).
