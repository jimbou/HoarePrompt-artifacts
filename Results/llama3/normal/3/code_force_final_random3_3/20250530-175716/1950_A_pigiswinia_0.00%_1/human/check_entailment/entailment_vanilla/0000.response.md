Reasoning:

1. The problem statement clearly defines the conditions for a stair and a peak. A stair requires the digits to be in ascending order (a < b < c), while a peak requires the digits to be in the form of a < b > c.

2. The given Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

3. Inside the loop, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and checks the conditions for a stair and a peak using if-elif-else statements.

4. If the condition for a stair is met (a < b < c), it prints 'STAIRS'. If the condition for a peak is met (a < b > c), it prints 'PEAK'. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

5. The program correctly handles the input and output as per the problem statement.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. In the output for the stair case, it prints 'STAIRS' instead of 'STAIR'. 

Correctness: **False**
