According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), `i` is 0**
