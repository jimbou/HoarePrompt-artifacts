Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers between 0 and 9, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned the values of the second line of stdin which contains three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the values of the second line of stdin, which contains three digits between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing three digits between 0 and 9.
