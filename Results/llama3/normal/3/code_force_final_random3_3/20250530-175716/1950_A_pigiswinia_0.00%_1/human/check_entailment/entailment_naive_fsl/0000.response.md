Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input is "3 2 1". According to the problem description, this should output "NONE", but the program outputs "PEAK". This is because the condition "a < b > c" is not sufficient to determine a peak, as it does not check if a > c. A correct condition for a peak would be "a < b and b > c".
