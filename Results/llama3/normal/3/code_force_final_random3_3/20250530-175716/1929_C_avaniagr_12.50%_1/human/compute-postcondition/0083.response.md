Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, `z` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`. The integer division of 1 by `k-1` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `k` is 2 or greater than 2. If `k` is 2, then `z` becomes 2. If `k` is greater than 2, then `z` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
