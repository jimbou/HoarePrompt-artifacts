Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the first test case in stdin, `x` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `z` is 2 plus the integer division of `z` by `k-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of `z` by `k-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, with at least one test case remaining. The conditions on `x` and `t` are still valid.
