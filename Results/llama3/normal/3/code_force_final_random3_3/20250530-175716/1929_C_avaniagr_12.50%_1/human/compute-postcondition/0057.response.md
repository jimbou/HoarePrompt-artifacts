Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the first test case in stdin, `x` must be at least 0, `i` is `x`, `z` is `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of `z` by `k-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain the first, second, and third integers from the first test case in stdin, `x` must be at least 0, `i` is equal to `x`, and `z` is `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of `z` by `k-1`. The state of stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases with at least 1 test case.
