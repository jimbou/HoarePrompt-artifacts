Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three space-separated integers: k, x, and a, where k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is an integer between 1 and 100, and a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and stdin now contains one less test case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1` but not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1` plus `x` times the integer division of `x` by `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, k, x, and a are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the first test case in stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If x is less than k-1, then if a is greater than or equal to x + 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If x is equal to k-1, then if a is greater than or equal to x + 3, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If x is greater than k-1, then i is set to x, z is set to x+1 plus x times the integer division of z by k-1, if a is greater than or equal to z, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `x` is less than `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` equals `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 3, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k-1` but not equal to `k-1`, then `z` is `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
