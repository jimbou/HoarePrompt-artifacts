Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, `z` is 0, `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `z` is now 0, while the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `k` is still valid, where `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`. The input stream still contains multiple test cases with at least one test case.
