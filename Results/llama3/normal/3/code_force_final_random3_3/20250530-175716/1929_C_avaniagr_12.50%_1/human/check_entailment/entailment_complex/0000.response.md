Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins based on the casino's rules and his initial number of coins.

The program correctly handles three cases:

1.  When `x` is less than `k-1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x+1`. This is because Sasha can afford to lose `x` times and still have enough coins to make a bet that guarantees a win.
2.  When `x` equals `k-1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x+3`. This is because Sasha needs to have enough coins to make a bet that guarantees a win after losing `x` times, and also have enough coins to make a bet that guarantees a win after winning once.
3.  When `x` is greater than or equal to `k-1` but not equal to `k-1`, it calculates a value `z` based on `x` and `k`, and checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. This is because Sasha needs to have enough coins to make a series of bets that guarantees a win after losing `x` times.

The program correctly prints 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
