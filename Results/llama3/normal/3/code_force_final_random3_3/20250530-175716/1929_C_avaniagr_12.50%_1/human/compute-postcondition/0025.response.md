Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `a` are integers, `z` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k - 1`, `x` is at least 1 and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k - 1`. This is because the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` is evaluated first, and then added to the original value of `z`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
