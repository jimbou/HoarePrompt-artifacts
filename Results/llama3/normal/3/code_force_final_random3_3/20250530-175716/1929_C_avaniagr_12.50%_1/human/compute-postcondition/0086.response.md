Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, `z` is `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `z` will be the sum of `x+1` and `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` is equal to `x`. The loop has executed `x+1` times, and the state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
