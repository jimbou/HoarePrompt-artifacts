Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'YES' because the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. The value of `z` is calculated as `x + 1` plus `x` times the integer division of `x` by `k - 1`, where `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`. The value of `x` is equal to `i`. However, the exact values of `x`, `k`, `a`, and `z` are not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical values. But based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output 'YES' because `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

Output: **YES**
