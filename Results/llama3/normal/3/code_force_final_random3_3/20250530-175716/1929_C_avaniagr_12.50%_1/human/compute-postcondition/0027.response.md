Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `a` are integers, `z` is 4 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k - 1`, `x` is at least 1 and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case**

The code increments the value of `z` by the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `z` is initially 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k - 1`, the new value of `z` is 4 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case.
