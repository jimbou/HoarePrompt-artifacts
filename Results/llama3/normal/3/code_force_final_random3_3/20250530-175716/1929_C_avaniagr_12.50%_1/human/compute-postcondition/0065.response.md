Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, k, x, and a are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the first test case in stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If x is equal to k-1, then if a is greater than or equal to x + 3, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If x is not equal to k-1, then i is set to x, z is set to x+1 plus x times the integer division of z by k-1, if a is greater than or equal to z, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
