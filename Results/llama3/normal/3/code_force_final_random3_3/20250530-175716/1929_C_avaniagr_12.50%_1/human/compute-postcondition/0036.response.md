Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1`. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1` but not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1` plus `x` times the integer division of `x` by `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
