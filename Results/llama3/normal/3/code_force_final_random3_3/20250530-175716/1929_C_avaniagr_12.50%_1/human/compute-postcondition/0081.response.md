Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, `z` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 1, as it was initially 0 and the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` evaluates to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `i` is 0 is still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case.
