Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `x` equals `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 3, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` does not equal `k-1`, then `z` is `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
