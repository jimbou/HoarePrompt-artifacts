Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, `z` is 3 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to be 3 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still an integer from the second test case in stdin, and `x` is still greater than or equal to 1. The value of `i` is still 2, and stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case.
