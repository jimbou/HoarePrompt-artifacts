The code accepts three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. Since `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, after accepting the first test case, there are still test cases left in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case**
