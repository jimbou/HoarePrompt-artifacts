Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, `z` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The variable `z` is newly introduced and assigned the value 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least 1 test case, as the code did not modify the input.
