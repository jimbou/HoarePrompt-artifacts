The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1` but not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1` plus `x` times the integer division of `x` by `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
