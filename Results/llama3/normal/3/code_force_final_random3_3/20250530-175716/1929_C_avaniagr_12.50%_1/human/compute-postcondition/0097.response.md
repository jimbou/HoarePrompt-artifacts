Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It then checks the conditions for each test case and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. The conditions are as follows: if x is less than k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+1; if x is equal to k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+3; if x is greater than or equal to k-1, it calculates a value z based on x and k, and checks if a is greater than or equal to z. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
