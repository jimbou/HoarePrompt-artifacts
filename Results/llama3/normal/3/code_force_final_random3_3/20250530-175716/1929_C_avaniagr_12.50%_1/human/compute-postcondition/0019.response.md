Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1` and currently equals `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.***
