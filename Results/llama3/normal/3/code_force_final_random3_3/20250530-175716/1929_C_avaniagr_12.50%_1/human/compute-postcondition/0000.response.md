Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three space-separated integers: k, x, and a, where k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is an integer between 1 and 100, and a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and stdin now contains one less test case.**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, as the first test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain three space-separated integers: k, x, and a, with the same constraints as before.
