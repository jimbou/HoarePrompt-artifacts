Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the first test case in stdin, `z` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 0, while the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least one test case.
