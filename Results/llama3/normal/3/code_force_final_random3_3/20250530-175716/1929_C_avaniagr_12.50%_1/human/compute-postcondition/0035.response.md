Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `a` are integers, `z` is `x + 1` plus `x` times the integer division of `x` by `k - 1`, `x` is larger or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
