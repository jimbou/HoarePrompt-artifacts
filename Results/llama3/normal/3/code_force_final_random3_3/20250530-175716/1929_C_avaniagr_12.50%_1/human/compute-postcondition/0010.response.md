Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case. The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
