Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are now the first, second, and third integers from the second test case in stdin, respectively. The stdin now contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, as one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function.
