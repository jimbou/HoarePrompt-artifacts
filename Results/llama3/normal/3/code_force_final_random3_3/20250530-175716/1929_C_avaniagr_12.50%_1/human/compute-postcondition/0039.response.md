Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the first test case in stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated to the first, second, and third integers from the first test case in stdin, respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The stdin now contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, but the first test case has been consumed.
