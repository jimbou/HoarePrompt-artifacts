Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers that are the first, second, and third integers from the last test case in stdin, stdin contains no test cases. If `x` is less than `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` equals `k-1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k-1` but not equal to `k-1`, then `z` is `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input and has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop has also updated the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` to the values from the last test case in the input. The input is now empty, and the loop has finished executing.
