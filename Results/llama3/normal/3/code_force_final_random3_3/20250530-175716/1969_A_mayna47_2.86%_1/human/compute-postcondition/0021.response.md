Functionality: **This function reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers from standard input, then checks for a specific condition in the list. If n is 2, it prints 2. If n is between 3 and 50, it checks if there exists an index i such that the value at index v[v[i]] equals i. If such an index exists, it prints 2. Otherwise, it takes no action.**
