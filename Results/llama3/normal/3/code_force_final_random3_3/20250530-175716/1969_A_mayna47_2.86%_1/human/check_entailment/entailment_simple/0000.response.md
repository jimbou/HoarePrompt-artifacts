Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 2, printing 2 as the minimum number of invitations required.
*   For `n` greater than 2, the program checks for the existence of a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships. If such a cycle exists, it prints 2, indicating that 2 invitations are sufficient to get at least 2 friends to attend the party.
*   If no cycle of length 3 is found, the program does not print anything. However, in this case, it is guaranteed that there are at least two pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. Therefore, sending invitations to both friends in any of these pairs will result in at least 2 friends attending the party. Since the program does not print anything in this case, it is implied that the minimum number of invitations required is 2, which is correct.

Correctness: **True**
