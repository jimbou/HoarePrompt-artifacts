Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and their best friend relationships `p_i` as a list `v`.
3.  If `n` is 2, it correctly prints 2, as both friends need to receive an invitation to attend the party.
4.  If `n` is greater than 2, it checks for a specific condition in the list. It iterates over each friend `i` and checks if the value at index `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. This condition is true if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
5.  If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that only two invitations are needed for at least two friends to attend the party.
6.  If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that at least three invitations are needed for at least two friends to attend the party.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads the input correctly, checks for the specific condition, and prints the correct output based on the condition.

Correctness: **True**
