The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is at least 2 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, `i` is at least 2, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`**
