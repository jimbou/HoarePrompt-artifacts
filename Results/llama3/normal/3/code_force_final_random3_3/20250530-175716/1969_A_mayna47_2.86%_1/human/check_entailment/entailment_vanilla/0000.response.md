Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party. The program takes into account the fact that each friend has a best friend and that both the friend and their best friend need to receive an invitation for the friend to come to the party.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends (n) and then reads the list of best friends (v) for each friend.

3. If the number of friends is 2, the program immediately prints 2, because in this case, both friends need to receive an invitation to come to the party.

4. If the number of friends is more than 2, the program then checks for each friend if their best friend's best friend is the friend themselves. This is done by checking if v[v[v[i]]] equals i. If this condition is met for any friend, it means that the friend and their best friend can come to the party if they both receive an invitation, so the program prints 2 and moves on to the next test case.

5. If the program doesn't find any pair of friends where each friend's best friend's best friend is the friend themselves, it means that at least 3 friends need to receive an invitation for at least 2 of them to come to the party. In this case, the program prints 3.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
