Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. 

1. If the number of friends is 2, it prints 2 because both friends need to be invited.

2. If the number of friends is more than 2, it checks for each friend if their best friend's best friend is the friend themselves. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2 because only these two friends need to be invited.

3. If it doesn't find such a pair, it prints 3 because at least three friends need to be invited to ensure that at least two friends come to the party.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least two friends come to the party. 

Note: The problem description guarantees that all p_i are distinct and p_i != i, which is crucial for the correctness of the program.
