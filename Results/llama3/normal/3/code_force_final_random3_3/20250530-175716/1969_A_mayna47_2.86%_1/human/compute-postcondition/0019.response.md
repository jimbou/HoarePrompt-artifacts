Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, `i` is equal to `n+1`. If there exists an `i` between 1 and `n` (inclusive) such that `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n+1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. Additionally, if at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` was true for any `i` between 1 and `n` (inclusive), then the number 2 will have been printed. If this condition was never true, then no action will have been taken. The state of the other variables, including `stdin`, `n`, and `v`, remains unchanged.
