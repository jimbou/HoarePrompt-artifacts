#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor of the initial a and the initial b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial a and the initial b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, a and b, using the Euclidean algorithm. It takes two positive integers as input and returns their GCD. The function does not modify the input variables, but rather returns a new value representing their GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers.
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, cnt is -1 plus the sum of the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) divided by (i * i) plus 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i), for all i from 1 to m, i is m.
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt, which is -1 plus the sum of the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) divided by (i * i) plus 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i), for all i from 1 to m, where n and m are positive integers and i is equal to m.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates a value based on the input positive integers n and m. It iterates from 1 to m, and for each iteration i, it calculates the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) divided by (i * i) and adds 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i). The function returns the sum of these calculations minus 1.
