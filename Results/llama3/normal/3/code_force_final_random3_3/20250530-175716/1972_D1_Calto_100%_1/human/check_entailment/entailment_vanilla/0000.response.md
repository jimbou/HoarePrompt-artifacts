Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem involving ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze it step by step.

1. Function 1 (`func_1`): This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The function is correct and works as expected.

2. Function 2 (`func_2`): This function is the core of the program, responsible for calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. The function iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m` and calculates the number of valid pairs for each `i`.

   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x` and `y` based on the current value of `i`. The calculation of `x` and `y` seems to be correct based on the problem description.
   
   - It then calculates the number of valid pairs for the current `i` by adding the ceiling of `x/y` and an additional 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). This calculation appears to be correct based on the problem constraints.
   
   - The function returns the total count of valid pairs by summing up the counts for all `i`.

3. Main Program: The main program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, calls `func_2` with these values, and prints the returned count.

Based on the step-by-step analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the GCD using `func_1` and uses this GCD to calculate the number of valid pairs in `func_2`. The main program correctly reads input, calls the functions, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
