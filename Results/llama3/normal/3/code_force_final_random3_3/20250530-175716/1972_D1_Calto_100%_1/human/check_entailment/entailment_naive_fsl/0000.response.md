Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem. The `func_1` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is a standard method for finding the GCD.

The `func_2` function calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. It iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m`, and for each `i`, it calculates the number of possible values of `a` that satisfy the condition `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The calculation involves finding the ceiling of `(n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)` and adding 1 if `(n - (i * i - i))` is a multiple of `i * i`.

The program correctly handles the case where `n` or `m` is 1, and it also correctly handles the case where `n` and `m` are large numbers.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Note: The program assumes that the input values `n` and `m` are positive integers, as stated in the problem description. If the input values can be negative or non-integer, the program may not work correctly.
