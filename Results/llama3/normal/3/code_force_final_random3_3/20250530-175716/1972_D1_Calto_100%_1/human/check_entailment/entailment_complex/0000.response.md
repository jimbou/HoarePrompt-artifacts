Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, which is used in the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 2 calculates the sum of the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i) plus 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i) for all i from 1 to m. This is not directly related to the conditions specified in the problem.

However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen that Function 2 is actually calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions. The expression (n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i) is equivalent to (n - i + 1) / i^2, which is the number of possible values of a for a given i. The ceiling function is used to round up to the nearest integer, and the additional 1 is added if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i), which corresponds to the case where a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Therefore, Function 2 is actually correct, and the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
