Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1, 1 if lex was less than or equal to 26, otherwise arr is a list containing 1, 26, 1 if lex was greater than 26**

The loop will execute 2 times, as specified in the loop head (for j in range(2)). After the loop finishes executing, the value of j will be 0, and the value of lex will be an integer less than or equal to 25. The list arr will contain either two 1's if lex was initially less than or equal to 26, or a 1, a 26, and a 1 if lex was initially greater than 26. The values of cases, i, and k remain unchanged.
