Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer. If lex is less than or equal to 26, lex is decreased by 2, and arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52. If lex is larger than 26 but less than 52, lex is decreased by 52, and arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and arr has two additional elements 26 appended to it. If lex is larger than or equal to 52, lex is decreased by 52, and arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and arr has two additional elements 26 appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute twice, and after each execution, the value of `lex` will be decreased by 1 if it is less than or equal to 26, by 26 if it is larger than 26 but less than 52, or by 26 if it is larger than or equal to 52. The list `arr` will have an additional element appended to it after each execution, which will be 1 if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, 26 if `lex` is larger than 25 but less than 52, or 26 if `lex` is larger than or equal to 52. The characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` will no longer be printed after the loop executes.
