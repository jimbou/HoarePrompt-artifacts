Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1, 1, and 26.**

The code modifies the list `arr` by appending the value 26 to it. This changes the list from containing only 1 and 1 to containing 1, 1, and 26. The second line of the code decrements the value of `lex` by 26. Since `lex` was initially an integer less than or equal to 25, subtracting 26 from it will result in a negative number, which is still an integer less than or equal to 25. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
