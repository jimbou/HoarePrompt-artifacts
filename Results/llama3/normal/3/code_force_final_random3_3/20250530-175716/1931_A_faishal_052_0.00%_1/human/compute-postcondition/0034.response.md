The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since `k` is 2, `arr[k]` refers to the third element of the `arr` list.

Given that `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52] depending on the original value of lex, the third element of `arr` will be either lex-2, lex-27, or lex-52.

Since `lex` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `lex`.

The ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` will be either `(lex-2) + 96`, `(lex-27) + 96`, or `(lex-52) + 96`, depending on the original value of `lex`.

The `chr` function converts this ASCII value to its corresponding character.

Output: **the character represented by the ASCII value of (lex-2) + 96, (lex-27) + 96, or (lex-52) + 96, depending on the original value of lex**
