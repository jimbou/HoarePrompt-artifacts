Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 48, the program outputs "auz", but the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded is actually "aav". 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the encoded word is less than or equal to 26. In this case, the program should output a word with three identical letters, but instead, it outputs a word with two identical letters and a third letter that is one position ahead in the alphabet.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to handle the case when the encoded word is less than or equal to 26 separately. For example, it could output a word with three identical letters, where the letter is determined by the encoded word. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to handle this case:

```
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        if lex <= 26:
            print(chr(lex + 96) * 3)
        else:
            arr = []
            for j in range(2):
                if lex <= 26:
                    arr.append(1)
                    lex = lex - 1
                elif lex < 52:
                    arr.append(26)
                    lex = lex - 26
                else:
                    arr.append(26)
                    lex = lex - 26
            arr.append(lex)
            arr.sort()
            for k in range(3):
                print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
            print()
```

This modified program correctly handles the case when the encoded word is less than or equal to 26 and outputs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded.
