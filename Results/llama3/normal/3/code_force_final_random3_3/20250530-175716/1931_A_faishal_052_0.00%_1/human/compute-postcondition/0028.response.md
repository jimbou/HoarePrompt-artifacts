The `print` statement will print a single character. The character is determined by the value of `arr[k] + 96`, where `arr[k]` is the first element of the `arr` list and `k` is 0.

Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52], the first element of `arr` is always 1.

Therefore, `arr[k] + 96` equals 1 + 96 = 97.

The `chr` function is used to convert an integer to a character. In this case, the integer 97 corresponds to the character 'a'.

Output: **a**
