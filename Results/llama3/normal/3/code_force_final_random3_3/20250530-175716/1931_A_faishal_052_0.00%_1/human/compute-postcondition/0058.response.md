Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer that is 26 less than its original value, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and arr has an additional element 26 appended to it.**

The code first appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Then, it decreases the value of `lex` by 26. The initial state of `lex` is not specified, but based on the conditions provided, we can infer that `lex` is an integer that is decreased by 26. The value of `lex` after the code execution is 26 less than its original value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
