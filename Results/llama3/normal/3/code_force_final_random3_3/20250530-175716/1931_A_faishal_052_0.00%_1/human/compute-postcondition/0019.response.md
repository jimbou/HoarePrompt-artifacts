To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for j in range(2):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of values from 0 to 1 (since the upper limit is exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `cases` is greater than 0
* `i` is 0
* `j` is 1
* If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains 1 and `lex` is one less than its original value.
* If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` is 26 less than its original value.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `j`. Since `j` is currently 1, the next iteration will start with `j` equal to 0 (because the range is from 0 to 1).

The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `lex`, and `arr`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains 1 and `lex` is one less than its original value. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` is 26 less than its original value.**
