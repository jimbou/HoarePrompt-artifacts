Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1, 1, and 26.**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `i` and `j` also remain the same, as they are not affected by the code. The value of `k` remains 3, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `lex` is decremented by 26, but its exact value is not specified, so it is described as an integer less than or equal to 25. The list `arr` is modified by appending the value 26 to it, resulting in a list containing 1, 1, and 26.
