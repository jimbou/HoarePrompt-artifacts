The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1.
State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 1, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1, 1, `lex` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `arr` is a list containing 1, 26, 1, `lex` if `lex` was greater than 26, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is being printed**
