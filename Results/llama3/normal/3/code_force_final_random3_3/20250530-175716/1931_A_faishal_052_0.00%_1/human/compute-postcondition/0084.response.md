Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is no longer being printed. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1. If `lex` is greater than 25, `lex` is an integer that has been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value, and is larger than 26, and `arr` is a list containing the integer 26.***
