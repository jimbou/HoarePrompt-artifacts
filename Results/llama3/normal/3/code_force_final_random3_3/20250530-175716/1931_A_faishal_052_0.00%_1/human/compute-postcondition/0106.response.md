The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`, where `k` is 2. Since `arr` is a list containing 1, 1, `lex` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `arr` is a list containing 1, 26, 1, `lex` if `lex` was greater than 26, and `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, `arr[2]` will be `lex`. Therefore, the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[2] + 96` will be printed.

Output: **the character represented by the ASCII value of lex + 96 (where lex is an integer less than or equal to 25)**
