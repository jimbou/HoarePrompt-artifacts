Output State: **cases is 0, i is equal to the initial value of cases, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1, 1, lex if lex was less than or equal to 26, otherwise arr is a list containing 1, 26, 1, lex if lex was greater than 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all the iterations specified by the initial value of `cases`. The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `cases`, and the inner loop counters `j` and `k` have reached their maximum values. The variable `lex` has been decreased to a value less than or equal to 25, and the list `arr` contains the final values based on the original value of `lex`. The characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` are no longer being printed, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
