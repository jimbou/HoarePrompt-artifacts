The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since `k` is 0, `arr[k]` is the first element of the list `arr`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, the first element of `arr` is 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, the first element of `arr` is also 1.

In both cases, `arr[k]` is 1. Adding 96 to 1 gives 97, which is the ASCII value of the character 'a'. Therefore, the code prints the character 'a'.

Output: **a**
