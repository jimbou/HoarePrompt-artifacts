Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer that has been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value, arr is an empty list, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is no longer being printed
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is no longer being printed. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1. If `lex` is greater than 25, `lex` is an integer that has been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value, and is larger than 26, and `arr` is a list containing the integer 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is no longer being printed. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1, 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1 and 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1, 1, 1 if lex was less than or equal to 26, otherwise arr is a list containing 1, 26, 1 if lex was greater than 26




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
