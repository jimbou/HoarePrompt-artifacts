Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing 1, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is no longer being printed**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, making it a list containing 1.
*   The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1, making it an integer less than or equal to 25.

All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`) remain unchanged. The character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is still not being printed, as the value of `arr[k]` is now 1, and the ASCII value of 1 + 96 is not a printable character.
