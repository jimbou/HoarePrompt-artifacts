Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer between 0 and 26, arr is a list containing the integer 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, bringing it within the range of 0 to 26. The list `arr` now contains the integer 26, which was appended to it. The rest of the variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`) remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` are still not being printed, as this condition was not modified by the code.
