The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `cases` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `cases` must be greater than 1.
State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 1, arr is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52] depending on the original value of lex, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are being printed**
