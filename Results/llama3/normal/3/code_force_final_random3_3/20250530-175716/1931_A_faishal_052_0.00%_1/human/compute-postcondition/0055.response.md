The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is decreased by 1. If `lex` is larger than 26 but less than 52, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` is larger than or equal to 52, `lex` is decreased by 26. `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` are no longer being printed if `lex` is larger than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed if `lex` is larger than or equal to 52**
