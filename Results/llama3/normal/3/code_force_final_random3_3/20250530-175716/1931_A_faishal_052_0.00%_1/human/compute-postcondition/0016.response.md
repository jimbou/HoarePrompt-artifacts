Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr contains 26, lex is 26 less than its original value**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. The second line subtracts 26 from the variable `lex`. The initial state provides information about the variables `cases`, `i`, and `j`, but these variables are not modified by the code. Therefore, their values remain the same. The variable `lex` is modified, and its new value is 26 less than its original value. The list `arr` is also modified by appending the value 26.
