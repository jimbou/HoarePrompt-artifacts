Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 0, arr contains 1 and 1, lex is one less than its original value.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` already contains 1 if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, or 26 if `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` now contains 1 and 1 if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, or 26 and 1 if `lex` is greater than 26. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
