Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1. If lex is less than or equal to 26, arr contains 1 and 1, and lex is two less than its original value. If lex is greater than 26 but less than 52, arr contains 1 and 26, and lex is 27 less than its original value if it was greater than 26, or two less than its original value if it was less than or equal to 26. If lex is 52 or more, arr contains 26 and 26, and lex is 52 less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The value of `cases` remains greater than 0, and `i` remains 0, as they are not affected by the loop.
* The value of `j` is 1, indicating that the loop has completed its second iteration.
* The value of `arr` depends on the initial value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains two 1s, and `lex` is two less than its original value. If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` contains a 1 and a 26, and `lex` is 27 less than its original value if it was greater than 26, or two less than its original value if it was less than or equal to 26. If `lex` is 52 or more, `arr` contains two 26s, and `lex` is 52 less than its original value.
