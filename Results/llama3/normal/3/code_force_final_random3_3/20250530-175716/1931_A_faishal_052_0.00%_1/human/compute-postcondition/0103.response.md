The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since `k` is 1, we need to look at the second element of the `arr` list.

If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, the `arr` list contains 1, 1, `lex`. In this case, the second element of `arr` is 1. The ASCII value of `1 + 96` is 97, which represents the character 'a'.

If `lex` is greater than 26, the `arr` list contains 1, 26, 1, `lex`. In this case, the second element of `arr` is 26. The ASCII value of `26 + 96` is 122, which represents the character 'z'.

Since `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, the first condition applies, and the second element of `arr` is 1.

Output: **a**
