Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 1, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1 and 26.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` initially contained the integer 1, it now contains both 1 and 26. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 26. However, the initial state specifies that if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, it remains an integer less than or equal to 25. Therefore, after the decrement, `lex` will still be an integer less than or equal to 25. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`) are not affected by the code snippet, so their values remain the same.
