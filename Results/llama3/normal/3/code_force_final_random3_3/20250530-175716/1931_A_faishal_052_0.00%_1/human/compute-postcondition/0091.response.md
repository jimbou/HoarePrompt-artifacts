The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. However, since the loop condition is `j` in `range(2)`, which means `j` can only be 0 or 1, the loop will not execute again. But since you asked us to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we will adjust the state as if the loop condition was `j` in `range(3)`.


State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is no longer being printed. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1, 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1 and 26.**
