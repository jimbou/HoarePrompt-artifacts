Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is [26], lex is an integer value between 26 and 26, j is 0**

The code consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making it no longer empty. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially between 26 and 52. This subtraction brings the value of `lex` within the range of 26 to 26, effectively making it equal to 26. The other variables, `cases`, `i`, and `j`, are not affected by the code and retain their initial values.
