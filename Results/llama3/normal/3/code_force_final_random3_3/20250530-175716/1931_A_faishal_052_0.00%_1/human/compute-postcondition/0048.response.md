Postcondition: ***cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer. If lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed. If lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed. If lex is larger than or equal to 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed.***
