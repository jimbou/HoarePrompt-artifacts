Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 1, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1 and 26.**

The code first appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making it contain both 1 and 26. Then, it subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which is an integer less than or equal to 25, resulting in a new value for `lex` that is also an integer less than or equal to 25. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
