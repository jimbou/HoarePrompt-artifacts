Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 0, arr contains 1 and 26 if lex was less than or equal to 26, or arr contains 26 and 26 if lex was greater than 26, and lex is 26 less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of `i` and `j` also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `arr` is modified by appending 26 to it, and its original value depends on whether `lex` was less than or equal to 26 or greater than 26. The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, regardless of its original value.
