Based on the precondition, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `cases` is greater than 1, but this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
2. `i` is 1, but this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
3. `j` is 2, but this variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
4. `k` is less than 3, which means `k` can be either 0, 1, or 2.
5. `lex` is an integer that has been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value. This means `lex` has been modified, but we don't know its exact value.
6. `arr` is a sorted list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96`. This means `arr` contains at least three elements: an integer 1 and two characters.
7. If `lex` is larger than 25 but less than 52, the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` are no longer being printed. This means that if `lex` is in this range, the characters in `arr` will not be printed.
8. If `lex` is larger than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed. This means that if `lex` is in this range, `arr` will contain only the integer 26 and no characters will be printed.
9. If `lex` is larger than 26 but less than 52 or if `lex` is larger than or equal to 52, `arr` has two additional elements 26 appended to it. This means that if `lex` is in either of these ranges, `arr` will have two additional elements with the value 26.
10. The value of `lex` has been appended to `arr` and sorted. This means that `lex` is now an element of `arr`, and `arr` has been sorted in ascending order.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`

Since `k` is less than 3, `arr[k]` can be either `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, or `arr[2]`.

If `lex` is larger than 25 but less than 52, the characters in `arr` will not be printed, so `arr[k]` will be an integer. In this case, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will return a character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`.

If `lex` is larger than or equal to 52, `arr` will contain only the integer 26, so `arr[k]` will be 26. In this case, `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will return a character represented by the ASCII value of 26 + 96 = 122.

If `lex` is larger than 26 but less than 52 or if `lex` is larger than or equal to 52, `arr` will have two additional elements with the value 26. In this case, `arr[k]` can be either 26 or one of the original elements of `arr`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `lex`, we can't determine the exact value of `arr[k]`. However, we can say that the print statement will print a character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`, where `arr[k]` is an element of the sorted list `arr`.

Output: **a character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96, where arr[k] is an element of the sorted list arr**
