Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 1, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is an empty list, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns an empty list to the variable `arr`, effectively clearing its previous contents. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `lex`. Since `lex` was not previously defined, its value is now set to the input integer. The other variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by the code snippet. The characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` are no longer being printed because `arr` is now an empty list.
