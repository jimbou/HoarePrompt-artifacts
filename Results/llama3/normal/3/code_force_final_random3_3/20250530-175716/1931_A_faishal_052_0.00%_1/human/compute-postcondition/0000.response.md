Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains one input: a sequence of `cases` integers `n` where 3 <= n <= 78**

In this output state, the value of `cases` is assigned the integer value from the first input, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains a sequence of `cases` integers `n`, where each `n` is between 3 and 78.
