The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making it non-empty. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially larger than 51.

Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is a list containing the value 26, lex is an integer value larger than 25, j is 0**
