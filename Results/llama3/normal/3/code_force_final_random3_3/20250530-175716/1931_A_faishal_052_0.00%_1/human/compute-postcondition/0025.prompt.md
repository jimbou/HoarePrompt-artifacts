Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer value from stdin
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 0. If lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is [1]. If lex is between 26 and 51, arr is [26]. If lex is larger than 51, arr is a list containing the value 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1. If lex is less than or equal to 26, arr contains 1 and lex is one less than its original value. If lex is greater than 26, arr contains 26 and lex is 26 less than its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains 1 and 1, and `lex` is one less than its original value. If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` contains 1 and 26, and `lex` is 26 less than its original value if it was greater than 26, or one less than its original value if it was less than or equal to 26. If `lex` is 52 or more, `arr` contains 26 and 26, and `lex` is 26 less than its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
