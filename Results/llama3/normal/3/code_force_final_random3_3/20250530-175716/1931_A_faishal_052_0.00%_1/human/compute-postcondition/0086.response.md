Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 1, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25 if it was initially less than or equal to 25, otherwise it is an integer larger than 26, and arr is a list containing 1, 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, and the second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The initial state of `lex` is either an integer less than or equal to 25 or an integer larger than 26, depending on its initial value. 

If `lex` is initially less than or equal to 25, it will be an integer less than or equal to 24 after the code executes. If `lex` is initially larger than 26, it will be an integer larger than 25 after the code executes. 

The list `arr` initially contains either the integer 1 or the integer 26, depending on the initial value of `lex`. After the code executes, `arr` will contain the integer 1, 1 if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or the integer 26, 1 if `lex` is larger than 26. 

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by the code snippet.
