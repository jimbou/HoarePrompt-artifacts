To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `k` and the range `3`. Since `3` is a constant, we can't adjust it. However, we can adjust `k` to ensure the loop can start.

Given that the loop will execute if `k` is within the range defined by `range(3)`, which means `k` should be 0 at the start of the loop to ensure it can execute at least once.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52] depending on the original value of lex, `k` is 0**
