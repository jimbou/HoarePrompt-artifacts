Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 0, arr contains 1 and 26 if lex was less than or equal to 26, or 26 and 26 if lex was greater than 26, lex is 26 less than its original value if it was greater than 26, or one less than its original value if it was less than or equal to 26.**

The code first appends 26 to the list `arr`, regardless of the initial value of `lex`. Then, it subtracts 26 from `lex`. If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, it would have been one less than its original value after the first condition in the initial state, and now it becomes 26 less than that value. If `lex` was initially greater than 26, it would have been 26 less than its original value after the first condition in the initial state, and now it remains 26 less than its original value. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code.
