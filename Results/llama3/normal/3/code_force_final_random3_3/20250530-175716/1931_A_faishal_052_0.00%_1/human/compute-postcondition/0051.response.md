Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 1, k is 3, lex is an integer less than its original value by 26, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and 26 if lex was less than or equal to 25, or a list containing the integer 26 and 26 if lex was larger than 25 but less than 52, or a list containing the integer 26 and 26 if lex was larger than or equal to 52.**

The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr` and then subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. The initial value of `lex` determines the original contents of `arr`. If `lex` was less than or equal to 25, `arr` originally contained the integer 1. If `lex` was larger than 25 but less than 52, `arr` originally contained the integer 26. If `lex` was larger than or equal to 52, `arr` originally contained the integer 26. After the code executes, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` contains an additional element, 26. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
