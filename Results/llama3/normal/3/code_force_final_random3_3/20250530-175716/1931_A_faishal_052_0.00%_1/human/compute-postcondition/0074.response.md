Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer that has been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value, arr is an empty list, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is no longer being printed**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns an empty list to the variable `arr`, effectively clearing its previous contents. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `lex`. Since `lex` was previously an integer that had been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value, its new value will be the input integer. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Note that the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is no longer being printed because `arr` is now an empty list, and `k` is still 3.
