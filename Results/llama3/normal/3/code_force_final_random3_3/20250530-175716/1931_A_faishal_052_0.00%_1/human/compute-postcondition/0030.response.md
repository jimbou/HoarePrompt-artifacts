To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which is `k` in this case.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than 3. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0. To execute the loop again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52] depending on the original value of lex, `k` is 1, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is being printed**

Note that the states of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr` remain the same, as they are not part of the loop head. Only the state of `k` is adjusted to reflect the next iteration of the loop.
