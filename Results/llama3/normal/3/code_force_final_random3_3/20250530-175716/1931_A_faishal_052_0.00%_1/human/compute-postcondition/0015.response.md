Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr contains 26, lex is 26 less than its original value**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The values of `i` and `j` also remain the same as they are not modified by the code. The `arr` list now contains the value 26, which was appended to it by the first line of the code. The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, resulting in a new value that is 26 less than its original value.
