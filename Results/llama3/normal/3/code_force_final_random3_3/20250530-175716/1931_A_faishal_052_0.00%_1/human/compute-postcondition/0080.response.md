Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer between 0 and 26, arr is a list containing the integer 26**.

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially larger than 26 but less than 52. Since `lex` is decreased by 26, its new value will be between 0 and 26. The other variables, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, are not affected by the code block.
