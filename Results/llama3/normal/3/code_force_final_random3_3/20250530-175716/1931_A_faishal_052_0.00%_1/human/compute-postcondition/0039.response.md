According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed  `j` must be 0.
State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is an empty list, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed**
