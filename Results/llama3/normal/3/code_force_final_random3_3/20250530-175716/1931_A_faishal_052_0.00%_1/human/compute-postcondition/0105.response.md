To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for k in range(3):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than 3. Since `k` is currently 1, the loop can execute again.

The only variable in the loop head is `k`. To adjust its state, we simply increment it by 1, since the `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and incrementing by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 2, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1, 1, `lex` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `arr` is a list containing 1, 26, 1, `lex` if `lex` was greater than 26, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is being printed which is the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[2] + 96`**
