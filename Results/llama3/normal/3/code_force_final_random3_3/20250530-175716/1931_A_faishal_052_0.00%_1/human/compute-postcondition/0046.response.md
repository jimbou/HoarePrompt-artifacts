Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer larger than 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been reduced by 26, and the list `arr` now contains the integer 26. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed, as the list `arr` now contains a value that corresponds to a printable character.
