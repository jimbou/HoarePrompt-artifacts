Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 1, k is 3, lex is an integer, arr is an empty list, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer. If lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed. If lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed. If lex is larger than or equal to 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `lex` is an integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is decreased by 1. If `lex` is larger than 26 but less than 52, `lex` is decreased by 26. If `lex` is larger than or equal to 52, `lex` is decreased by 26. `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` are no longer being printed if `lex` is larger than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed if `lex` is larger than or equal to 52.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer. If lex is less than or equal to 26, lex is decreased by 1, and arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52. If lex is larger than 26 but less than 52, lex is decreased by 26, and arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and arr has an additional element 26 appended to it. If lex is larger than or equal to 52, lex is decreased by 26, and arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and arr has an additional element 26 appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
