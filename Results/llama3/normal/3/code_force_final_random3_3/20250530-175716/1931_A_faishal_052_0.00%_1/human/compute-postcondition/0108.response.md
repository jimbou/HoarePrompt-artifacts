Output State: **cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1, 1, lex if lex was less than or equal to 26, otherwise arr is a list containing 1, 26, 1, lex if lex was greater than 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are being printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only changes being in the variables affected by the loop head and body. The loop iterates 3 times, printing the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96. The values of cases, i, j, and lex remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
