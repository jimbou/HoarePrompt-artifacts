To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and the range `2`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if the range `2` is at least 1. Since `j` is the loop variable, we need to adjust its state to be within the range.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, `lex` is an integer that has been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value, `arr` is an empty list, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is no longer being printed**

Note that I've adjusted the state of `j` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range `2`. The other states remain unchanged, as they are not directly related to the loop head.
