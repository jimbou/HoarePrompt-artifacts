The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Here, `k` is 1, so we need to look at the second element of the `arr` list.

Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52] depending on the original value of lex, the second element of `arr` will be either 1 or 26.

If the second element of `arr` is 1, then `arr[k] + 96` will be 97, which is the ASCII value of 'a'. If the second element of `arr` is 26, then `arr[k] + 96` will be 122, which is the ASCII value of 'z'.

Therefore, the code will print either 'a' or 'z', depending on the original value of lex.

Output: **a or z (where a is the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 when the second element of arr is 1, and z is the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 when the second element of arr is 26)**
