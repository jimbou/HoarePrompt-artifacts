According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If the loop can execute, then `j` must be 0 because the range is 2. So, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to 0. The other variables are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer value from stdin, j is 0**
