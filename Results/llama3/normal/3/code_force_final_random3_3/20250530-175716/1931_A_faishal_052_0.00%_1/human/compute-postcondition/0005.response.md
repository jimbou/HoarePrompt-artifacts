The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, and the second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1.

Since `arr` is initially an empty list, after the first line, `arr` will contain the value 1. The second line decreases the value of `lex` by 1. Since `lex` is initially an integer value from stdin and its current value is less than or equal to 26, after the decrement, `lex` will be an integer value less than or equal to 25.

The variables `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, arr is [1], lex is an integer value less than or equal to 25, j is 0**
