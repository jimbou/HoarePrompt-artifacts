The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If cases is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, cases is an integer between 1 and 100 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `cases` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
