Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of an integer 't' followed by 't' integers 'n'. For each 'n', it constructs a list of three integers based on the value of 'n', sorts the list, and prints the characters represented by the ASCII values of the sorted list elements plus 96. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding characters for each case.**
