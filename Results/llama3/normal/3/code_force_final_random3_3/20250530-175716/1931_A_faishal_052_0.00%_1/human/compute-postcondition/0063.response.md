According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 0 and less than 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is 3, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is less than 3.

State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is less than 3, lex is an integer that has been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value, arr is a sorted list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and arr has two additional elements 26 appended to it if lex is larger than 26 but less than 52 or if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and the value of lex has been appended to arr and sorted.**
