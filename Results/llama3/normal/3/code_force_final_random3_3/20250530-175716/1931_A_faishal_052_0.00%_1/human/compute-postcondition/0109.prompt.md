Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains one input: a sequence of `cases` integers `n` where 3 <= n <= 78
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex <= 26:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        else:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    for k in range(3):
        print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52] depending on the original value of lex, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, lex is an integer that has been decreased by either 2 or 52 depending on its initial value, arr is a sorted list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and arr has two additional elements 26 appended to it if lex is larger than 26 but less than 52 or if lex is larger than or equal to 52, and the value of lex has been appended to arr and sorted, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed, and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is greater than 2, i is 2, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer less than or equal to 25, and arr is a list containing 1, 1, lex if lex was less than or equal to 26, otherwise arr is a list containing 1, 26, 1, lex if lex was greater than 26, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
