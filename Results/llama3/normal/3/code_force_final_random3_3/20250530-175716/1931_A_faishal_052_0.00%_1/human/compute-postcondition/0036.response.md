Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52] depending on the original value of lex, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are being printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and the value of k is now 3, indicating that the loop has completed all 3 iterations. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, with cases still being greater than 0, i still being 0, j still being 1, and arr still containing the same values in sorted ascending order. The loop has printed the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96.
