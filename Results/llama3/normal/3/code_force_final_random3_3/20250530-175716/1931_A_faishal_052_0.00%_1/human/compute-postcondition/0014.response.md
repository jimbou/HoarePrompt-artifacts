Output State: **cases is greater than 0, i is 0, j is 1, arr contains 1, lex is one less than its original value.**

In this final state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The values of `i` and `j` also remain the same, as they were not modified by the code. The list `arr` now contains the value 1, which was appended by the first line of the code. The value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, resulting in a new value that is one less than its original value.
