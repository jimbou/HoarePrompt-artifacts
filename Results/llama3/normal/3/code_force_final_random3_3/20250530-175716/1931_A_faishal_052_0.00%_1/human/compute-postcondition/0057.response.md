Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 2, k is 3, lex is decreased by 26, arr is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than 25 but less than 52, arr is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed if lex is larger than or equal to 52**

In this final state, the value of `lex` has been decreased by 26 due to the second line of the code. The value of `arr` has been modified by appending the integer 26 to the list, as specified in the first line of the code. The rest of the variables, `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, remain unchanged. The conditions for printing characters represented by ASCII values in the list `arr` are still dependent on the value of `lex`, but the specific values of `lex` that trigger these conditions have been shifted down by 26 due to the decrease in `lex`.
