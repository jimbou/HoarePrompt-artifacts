To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for j in range(2):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to 1 (since the upper bound is exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust its state.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `lex` is an integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` is a list containing the integer 1 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed. If `lex` is larger than 25 but less than 52, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` are no longer being printed. If `lex` is larger than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing the integer 26 and the characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed.**
