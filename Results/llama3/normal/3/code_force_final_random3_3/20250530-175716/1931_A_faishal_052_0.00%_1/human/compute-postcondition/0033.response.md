To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for k in range(3):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 0 to 2 (since the range is exclusive of the end value).

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be 2.

The other variables in the state (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2], [1, 26, lex-27], or [26, 26, lex-52] depending on the original value of lex, `k` is 2**
