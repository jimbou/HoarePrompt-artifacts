Output State: **cases is greater than 1, i is 1, j is 0, k is 3, lex is an integer and its current value is less than or equal to 25, arr is a list containing the integer 1, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96 are no longer being printed**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, resulting in a value less than or equal to 25. The list `arr` now contains the integer 1, which was appended in the first line of the code. The characters represented by the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96` are no longer being printed, as the list `arr` has been modified. All other variables remain unchanged.
