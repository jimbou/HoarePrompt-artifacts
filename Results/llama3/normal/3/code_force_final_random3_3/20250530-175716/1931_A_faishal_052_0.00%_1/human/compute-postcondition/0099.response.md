To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `k` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `k` is within the range defined by `range(3)`, which means `k` should be 0, 1, or 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 0, `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 25, and `arr` is a list containing 1, 1, `lex` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `arr` is a list containing 1, 26, 1, `lex` if `lex` was greater than 26**
