Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit equal to `trump` with one less element, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, and a new string that is the concatenation of `rank`, `suit`, a space, the last character that was in `trumps`, and `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and at least 1 key-value pair, `suit` is another key in `suits`, `rank` is the value associated with that key, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop due to the `continue` statement. No variables have changed values, and the program execution continues to the next iteration.
