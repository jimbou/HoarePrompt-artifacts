Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank`, `rank` is the first character of the first word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in the original stdin, `card` is the first word in the original stdin, the suit of the card is not equal to the trump, and the value of the suit in the suits dictionary is `rank`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The stdin still contains t-1 integers. The trump, trumps, and answers variables remain unchanged. The suits dictionary now has a value for the key `suit` which is `rank`. The rank, suit, and card variables still hold the same values as before. The suit of the card is still not equal to the trump, but now the value of the suit in the suits dictionary is `rank`.
