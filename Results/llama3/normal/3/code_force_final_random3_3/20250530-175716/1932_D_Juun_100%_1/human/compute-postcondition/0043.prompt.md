Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit equal to `trump`, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit equal to `trump` with one less element, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, and a new string that is the concatenation of `rank`, `suit`, a space, the last character that was in `trumps`, and `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and at least one key-value pair, `suit` is one of the keys in `suits`. If `rank` is None, the rest of the code in the current loop or if statement is skipped.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit equal to `trump` with one less element, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, and a new string that is the concatenation of `rank`, `suit`, a space, the last character that was in `trumps`, and `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and at least 2 key-value pairs, `suit` is another key in `suits`. If `rank` is None, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `rank`, `suit`, `trumps`, and `answers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit equal to `trump` with one less element, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, and a new string that is the concatenation of `rank`, `suit`, a space, the last character that was in `trumps`, and `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and at least 1 key-value pair, `suit` is another key in `suits`. If `rank` is None, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `rank` is the value associated with `suit` in `suits`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
