Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None, `rank` is the first character of the first word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in the original stdin, `card` is the first word in the original stdin.**

In this output state, the first word from the stdin has been processed and split into two variables: `rank` and `suit`. The `rank` variable now holds the first character of the first word, and the `suit` variable holds the second character of the first word. The `card` variable still holds the first word from the original stdin. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less integer, as the first word has been processed.
