To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `card` and the `input()` function. The `input()` function reads a line from `stdin`, splits it into words, and returns a list of words. For the loop to execute, `stdin` must contain at least one word.

State: **stdin contains t integers, t test cases, trump is a character, trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None, card is the first word in stdin**
