Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, and a new string that is the concatenation of `rank`, `suit`, a space, the last character that was in `trumps`, and `trump` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-None value, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and all key-value pairs have non-None values, and all elements of the `trumps` list followed by the `trump` character are printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `trumps` list is empty, and all elements of the original `trumps` list followed by the `trump` character have been printed. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing at least 1 answer, `answer` is the first answer in the `answers` list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and all key-value pairs have non-None values, and the first answer in the `answers` list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing at least 2 answers, `answer` is the second answer in the `answers` list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and all key-value pairs have non-None values, and the second answer in the `answers` list which is `[answer]` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing at least 3 answers, `answer` is the third answer in the `answers` list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and all key-value pairs have non-None values, and the third answer in the `answers` list is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
