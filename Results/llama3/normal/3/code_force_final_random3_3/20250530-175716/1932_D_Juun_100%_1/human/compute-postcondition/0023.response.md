Output State: **`stdin` contains t integers, `trump` is a character, `card` is the third word in the original stdin, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin, the first character of the second word in the original stdin, and the first character of the third word in the original stdin and the first character of the third word in the original stdin, `answers` is a list containing two strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of the third word in the original stdin, followed by the second character of the third word in the original stdin, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank` if `suits[suit]` is None, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains None.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `suits[suit]` has been updated to `rank` if it was previously None. All other variables remain unchanged.
