Output State: **`stdin` contains t integers, `trump` is a character, `rank` is the first character of the second word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in the original stdin, `card` is the second word in the original stdin. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin and the first character of the second word in the original stdin and `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin. If the value of `suits[suit]` is not None, then `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit and `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the values of `rank` and `suit` are now explicitly assigned to the first and second characters of the second word in the original stdin, respectively. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the conditions for `trumps` and `answers` are still dependent on the values of `suit` and `trump`.
