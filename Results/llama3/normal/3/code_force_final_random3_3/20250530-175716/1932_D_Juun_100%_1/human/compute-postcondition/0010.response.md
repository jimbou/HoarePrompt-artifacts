Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values not None for the key suit, but None for the key suit, `rank` is the first character of the first word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in the original stdin, `card` is the first word in the original stdin, and the suit of the card is not equal to the trump. If the value of `suits[suit]` is not None, then `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list and `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank`.***
