Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit equal to `trump` with one less element, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, and a new string that is the concatenation of `rank`, `suit`, a space, the last character that was in `trumps`, and `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and at least 2 key-value pairs, `suit` is another key in `suits`. If `rank` is None, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `rank`, `suit`, `trumps`, and `answers`.***
