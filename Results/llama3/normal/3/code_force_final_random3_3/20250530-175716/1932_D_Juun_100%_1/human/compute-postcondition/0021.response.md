Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `trump` is a character, `card` is the third word in the original stdin, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin, the first character of the second word in the original stdin, the first character of the third word in the original stdin, the first character of the third word in the original stdin, and `rank`, `answers` is a list containing two strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of the third word in the original stdin, followed by the second character of the third word in the original stdin, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank` if `suits[suit]` is None, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains None.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of `rank` to the `trumps` list, and the `stdin` now contains one less integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
