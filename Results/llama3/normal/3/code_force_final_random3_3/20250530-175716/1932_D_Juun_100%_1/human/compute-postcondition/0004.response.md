Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None, `rank` is the first character of the first word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in the original stdin, `card` is the first word in the original stdin. The current value of `suit` is equal to the current value of `trump`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `trumps` now contains the first character of the first word in the original stdin, which is the value of `rank`. All other variables remain unchanged.
