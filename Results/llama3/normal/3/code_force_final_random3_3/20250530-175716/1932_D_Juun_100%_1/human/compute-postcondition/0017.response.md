Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains t integers, `trump` is a character, `rank` is the first character of the second word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in the original stdin, `card` is the second word in the original stdin. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin and the first character of the second word in the original stdin. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin. `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank` if `suits[suit]` is None, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains None.***
