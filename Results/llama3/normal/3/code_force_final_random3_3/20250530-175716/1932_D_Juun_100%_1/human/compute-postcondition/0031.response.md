Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is a non-empty list containing the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit equal to `trump`, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and at least one key-value pair, `suit` is one of the keys in `suits`. If `rank` is None, the rest of the code in the current loop or if statement is skipped.***
