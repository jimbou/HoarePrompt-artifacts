Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes the input to determine the trump suit and cards, and then prints out the sorted cards in a specific format. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cards, the trump suit, and the cards themselves. It then processes the cards to determine the sorted order and prints out the result. If there are any remaining trump cards, it prints them out in pairs. Finally, it prints out the sorted non-trump cards. The function does not return any value, but instead prints out the results directly.**
