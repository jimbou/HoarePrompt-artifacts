Output State: **stdin contains t-1 integers, trump is a character, trumps is an empty list, answers is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, followed by the suit, suits is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values not None for the key suit, but None for the key suit, rank is the first character of the first word in the original stdin, suit is the second character of the first word in the original stdin, card is the first word in the original stdin, and the suit of the card is not equal to the trump, and the current value of suits[suit] is None.**

In this output state, the first line of code appends a string to the answers list. This string is created by concatenating the sorted values of suits[suit] and rank, followed by the suit. The second line of code sets the value of suits[suit] to None. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
