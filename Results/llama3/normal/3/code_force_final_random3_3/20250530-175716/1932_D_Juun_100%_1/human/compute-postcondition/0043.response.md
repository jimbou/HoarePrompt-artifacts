Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `trump` is a character, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, and a new string that is the concatenation of `rank`, `suit`, a space, the last character that was in `trumps`, and `trump` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-None value, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and all key-value pairs have non-None values.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state is such that `stdin` remains empty, `trump` remains a character, `trumps` becomes an empty list as all its elements have been popped and used to create new strings in `answers`, `answers` contains a list of strings where each string is a concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]`, the first character of each word in the original stdin that has a suit not equal to `trump`, followed by the suit, and a new string that is the concatenation of `rank`, `suit`, a space, the last character that was in `trumps`, and `trump` for each suit in `suits` that has a non-None value. The `suits` dictionary has all its key-value pairs updated with non-None values.
