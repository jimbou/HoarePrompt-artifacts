The code prints a formatted string containing the last two elements of the `trumps` list, the value of `trump`, and the last character that was in `trumps`. The `trumps.pop()` function removes and returns the last element of the `trumps` list. The `trump` variable is a character.

Output: **the last element of the trumps list, the value of trump, the second last element of the trumps list, the value of trump**
