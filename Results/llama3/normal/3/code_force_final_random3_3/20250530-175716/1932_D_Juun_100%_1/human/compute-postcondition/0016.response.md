Output State: **`stdin` contains t integers, `trump` is a character, `rank` is the first character of the second word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in the original stdin, `card` is the second word in the original stdin. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin and the first character of the second word in the original stdin and `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin. If the value of `suits[suit]` is not None, then `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit and `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `suits[suit]` has been updated to `rank`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
