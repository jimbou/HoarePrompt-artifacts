Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 integers, t test cases, trump is a character, trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains t-1 integers, `trump` is a character, `rank` is the first character of the first word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the first word in the original stdin, `card` is the first word in the original stdin. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin and `answers` is an empty list. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is an empty list. If the value of `suits[suit]` is not None, then `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list and `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` contains t integers, `trump` is a character, `rank` is the first character of the second word in the original stdin, `suit` is the second character of the second word in the original stdin, `card` is the second word in the original stdin. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin, the first character of the second word in the original stdin and `rank`. If `suit` is not equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin and `rank`. `answers` is a list containing one string which is the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank`, followed by the suit. `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank` if `suits[suit]` is None, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` contains t-1 or t integers, `trump` is a character, `card` is the third word in the original stdin, `trumps` is a list containing the first character of the first word in the original stdin, the first character of the second word in the original stdin, the first character of the third word in the original stdin, the first character of the third word in the original stdin, and `rank` if `suit` is equal to `trump`, otherwise it contains the first character of the first word in the original stdin, the first character of the second word in the original stdin, and the first character of the third word in the original stdin and the first character of the third word in the original stdin, `answers` is a list containing two or three strings which are the concatenation of the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and the first character of the third word in the original stdin, followed by the second character of the third word in the original stdin, `suits` is a dictionary with keys C, D, H, S and values None except for the key `suit` which has the value `rank` if `suits[suit]` is None, otherwise `suits[suit]` remains None. If `suits[suit]` is not None, `answers` contains three strings, otherwise `answers` contains two strings.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
