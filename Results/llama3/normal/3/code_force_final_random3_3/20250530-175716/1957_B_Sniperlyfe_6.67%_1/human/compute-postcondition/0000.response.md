Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of n zeros.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `nums`, which is a list of `n` zeros. The length of the list `nums` is equal to the value of `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
