Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where all elements except the last one are (1 << `k`.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the last element is (1 << `k`.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + `k`, `i` is `n-1`**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of elements `n` is still greater than or equal to 0. The value of `k` remains 0. The list `nums` still contains `n` integers, but the last element has been incremented by `k`, which is 0, so its value is still (1 << `k`.bit_length() - 1) - 1. The index `i` is still `n-1`.
