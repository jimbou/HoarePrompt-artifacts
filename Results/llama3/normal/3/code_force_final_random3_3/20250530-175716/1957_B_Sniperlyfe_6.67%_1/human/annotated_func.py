#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: n is greater than or equal to 0, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where all elements are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, i is n-1
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of `n` integers where all elements except the last one are (1 << `k`.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the last element is (1 << `k`.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + `k`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is 0, and `i` is `n-1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of `n` integers, where all elements except the last one are the maximum possible value that can be represented by `k` bits minus 1, and the last element is the maximum possible value that can be represented by `k` bits minus 1 plus the remaining value of `k`. The function takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, and returns the generated list. The function ensures that `k` is reduced to 0 and all elements in the list are non-negative.
