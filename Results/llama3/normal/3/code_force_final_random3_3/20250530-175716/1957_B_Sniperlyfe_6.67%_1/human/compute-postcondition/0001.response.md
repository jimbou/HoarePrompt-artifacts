The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of n zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of n zeros, `i` is 0**
