Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence of numbers. The function `func_1` generates a list of `n` integers, where all elements except the last one are the maximum possible value that can be represented by `k` bits minus 1, and the last element is the maximum possible value that can be represented by `k` bits minus 1 plus the remaining value of `k`. This approach ensures that the sum of the sequence is equal to `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
