Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is 1 and `k` is any number. In this case, the program should return a single number `k`, but the program returns `[k-1, 1]` instead.

For example, when `n` is 1 and `k` is 5, the program returns `[4, 1]` instead of `[5]`.

The issue is in the line `nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which calculates the maximum possible value for each number in the sequence. However, when `n` is 1, this calculation is not necessary, and the program should simply return `[k]`.

To fix this issue, the program should add a special case for when `n` is 1, and return `[k]` directly.
