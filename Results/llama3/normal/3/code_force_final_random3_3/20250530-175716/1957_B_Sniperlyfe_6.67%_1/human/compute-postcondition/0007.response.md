Output State: **n is greater than or equal to 0, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where all elements are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, i is n-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, the value of `k` becomes 0, the list `nums` is filled with the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for all its elements, and the loop counter `i` reaches the value `n-1`.
