Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is a non-negative integer, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are zeros, i is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains greater than 0, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` is reduced by the value of `nums[i]`, which is calculated as `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This means that `k` is now a non-negative integer, as it is decreased by a positive value. The list `nums` is modified, with the first element (`nums[i]`) being set to the calculated value, and the rest of the elements remaining zeros. The value of `i` remains 0, as it is not modified by the code.
