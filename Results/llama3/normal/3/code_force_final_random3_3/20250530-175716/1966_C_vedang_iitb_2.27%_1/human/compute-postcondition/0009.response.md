Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is larger than 2, `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The code only assigns the result of the function call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` to the variable `winNext`. The value of `winNext` is now equal to the result of this function call, which is not specified in the initial state.
