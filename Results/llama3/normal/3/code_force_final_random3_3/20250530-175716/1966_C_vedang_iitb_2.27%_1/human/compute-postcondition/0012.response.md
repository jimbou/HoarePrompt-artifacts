Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is larger than 2, `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`, `winNext` is not equal to 2 and either `winNext` is not equal to 1 or `a[0]` is equal to 1***
