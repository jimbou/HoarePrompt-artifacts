Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game.

In the function `func_2`, the base case for `n == 1` is incorrect. If there is only one pile, the player who goes first will always win, regardless of the size of the pile. Therefore, the function should return `1` (Alice wins) for `n == 1`, not `2` (Bob wins).

Additionally, the function `func_2` does not correctly handle the case where the smallest pile has a size of 1. In this case, the player who goes first will always win, because they can remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving the opponent with no move.

For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3]`, the program will output `Bob`, but the correct output should be `Alice`, because Alice can win by removing 1 stone from each pile on her first turn.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
