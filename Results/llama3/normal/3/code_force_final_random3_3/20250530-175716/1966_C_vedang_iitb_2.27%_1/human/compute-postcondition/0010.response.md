Postcondition: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is larger than 2, `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. The current value of `winNext` is either 2 or 1, and if `winNext` is 1, then the first element of `a` is not 1.**
