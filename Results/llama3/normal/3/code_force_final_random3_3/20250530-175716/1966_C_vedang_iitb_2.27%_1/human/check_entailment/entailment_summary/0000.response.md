Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly transforms the input list of stone piles into a list of increments between consecutive unique elements. This is done by removing duplicates, sorting the list, and calculating the differences between each element and its previous element.

Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the transformed list. It uses a recursive approach to consider the parity of the first element in the list and the outcome of a recursive call with the rest of the list. The function returns 1 if the game can be won, and 2 otherwise.

The main program correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` to transform the list, and then calls `func_2` to determine the outcome of the game. It prints "Alice" if `func_2` returns 1, and "Bob" otherwise.

The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior of the program, and the execution summaries of the functions provide a clear understanding of their behavior.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
