Correctness: **True**.

The provided program seems to correctly solve the problem. It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by removing numbers optimally. The logic behind the program is to count the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero. The program uses the fact that the XOR of a number with itself is zero, and the XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.

The program works by summing up the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed for each type of number (ones, twos, threes, and fours). The number of pairs is calculated as 3 times the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed, plus the number of single numbers that can be removed (which is only possible if there is an odd number of that type of number). The result is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where there are no numbers of a certain type, and the case where there is an odd number of numbers of a certain type. The program also correctly handles the case where the input numbers are not in the range 0 to 200, as the problem statement allows.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
