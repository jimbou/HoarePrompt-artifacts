The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, n and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n` and `r`. If `j` is less than `n + r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` is `n + 1` and `n` is at least 1 and `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
