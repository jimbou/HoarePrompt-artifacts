Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is either greater than or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to n, r is either n or 0, i is n, j is either n + 1 or n + r, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains an integer greater than 1, and `_` remains 1. The value of `n` is still an integer that must be at least 1. The value of `sum` is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2, or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `r` is either `n` or 0. The value of `i` is `n`, and the value of `j` is either `n + 1` or `n + r`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing -1 inputs.
