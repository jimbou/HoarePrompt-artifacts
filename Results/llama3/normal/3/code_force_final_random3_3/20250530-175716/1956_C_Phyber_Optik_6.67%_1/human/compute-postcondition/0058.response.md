To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n` + `r`, stdin contains -1 inputs**
