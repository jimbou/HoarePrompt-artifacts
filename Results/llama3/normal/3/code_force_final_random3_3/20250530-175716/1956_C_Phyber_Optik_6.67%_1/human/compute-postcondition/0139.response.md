Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n, j is 1, stdin contains -2 inputs, r is either n, n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, n + r is at least 1. If j is less than or equal to n, then the program prints 1, followed by a space, and the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), where n is at least 1. If j is larger than n, then the program prints "2, 1 % n, end=' '", followed by the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).***
