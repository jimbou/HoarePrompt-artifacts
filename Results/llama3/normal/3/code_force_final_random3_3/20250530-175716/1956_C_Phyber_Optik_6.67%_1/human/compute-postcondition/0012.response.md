Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is 2 and `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the original value of `sum`. Otherwise, `r` is either 1 or 0 and `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `i * n + 2 * n`.***
