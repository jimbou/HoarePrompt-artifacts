To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop will execute if `n + r` is at least 1. 

Since `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, and `n - 1` otherwise, we can conclude that `n + r` is at least 1 if `n` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, `i` is `n + 1`, so we can adjust `i` to be `n`. Also, `j` is not defined before the loop, so we can define it as 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: the sum which is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, and `n + r` which is `n + n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n + (n - 1)` otherwise**
