Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n, j is n, stdin contains -2 inputs. If n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * n and r is n. Otherwise, if n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * (n - 1) + n * (n - 1) and r is n - 1. Otherwise, if n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * (n - 2) + n * (n - 1) + n * (n - 2) and r is n - 2. Otherwise, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * (n - 3) + n * (n - 1) + n * (n - 2) + n * (n - 3) and r is n - 3.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the variable `j` will still be equal to `n`. The variable `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` multiplied by the number of times the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the sum of `i * n` for the remaining iterations. The variable `r` will be the number of times the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true. The other variables `_` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
