Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads the first line from the stdin, which contains the number of test cases `t`.
	* `int()` converts the input string to an integer.
	* The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Since the initial state mentions that the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 500), we can conclude that the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (with one line already read)**

Note that we mention that stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one line has already been read (the first line containing the number of test cases).
