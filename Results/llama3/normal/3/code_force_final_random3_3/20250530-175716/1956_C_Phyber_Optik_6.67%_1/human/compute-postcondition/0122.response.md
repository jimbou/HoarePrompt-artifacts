Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value.
2. The value of `i` is 3, and the value of `n` is an integer that must be at least 4.
3. The initial value of `sum` depends on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` being greater than, less than, or equal to `i * n`.

Let's consider the three possible cases:

Case 1: `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`
In this case, the initial value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2`. After updating `sum`, its new value is:
`sum = n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n`

Case 2: `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than `i * n`
In this case, the initial value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n`. After updating `sum`, its new value is:
`sum = n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n + 3 * n`

Case 3: `n * (n + 1) // 2` is equal to `i * n`
In this case, the initial value of `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n`. After updating `sum`, its new value is:
`sum = i * n + 2 * n + 3 * n = 6 * n`

In all cases, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n + 3 * n`, or `6 * n`, `r` is either 2, 1, or 0, and stdin contains -2 inputs.**
