Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, stdin contains -2 inputs. The current value of `n` is such that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers (`n * (n + 1) // 2`) is greater than the product of `i` and `n`.**
