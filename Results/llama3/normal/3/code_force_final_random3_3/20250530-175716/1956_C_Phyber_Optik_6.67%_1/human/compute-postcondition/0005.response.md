Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, sum is equal to n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 1, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`. Since `i` is 1, `r` becomes 1. The second line increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, `n * (n + 1) // 2` is a positive integer. The value of `sum` becomes equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`. No other variables are affected.
