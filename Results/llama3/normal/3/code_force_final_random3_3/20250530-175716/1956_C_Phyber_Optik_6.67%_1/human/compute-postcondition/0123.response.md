Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 3. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` and `r` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n + 3 * n` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n + 6 * n` and `r` is 0. stdin contains -2 inputs.***
