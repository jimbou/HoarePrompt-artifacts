The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and `t` is greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is either greater than or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to n, r is either n or 0, i is n, j is n + r, stdin contains -1 inputs. If j is less than or equal to n, then "1, j" is printed, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). If j is greater than n, then "2, j % n" is printed, followed by the numbers from 1 to n.**
