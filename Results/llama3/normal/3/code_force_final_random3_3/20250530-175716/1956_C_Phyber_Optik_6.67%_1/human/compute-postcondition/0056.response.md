The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + r`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
