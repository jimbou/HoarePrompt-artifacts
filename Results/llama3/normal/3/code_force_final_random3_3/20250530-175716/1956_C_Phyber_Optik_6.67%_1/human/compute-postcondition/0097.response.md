The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, n and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n` and `r`. If `j` is less than `n + r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `r` is either `n` or 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be `j + 2`, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `r` is either `n` or 0.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`, `r` is either `n` or 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 2`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1, j + 1" is printed, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Otherwise, "2, (j+1) % n" is printed, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.**
