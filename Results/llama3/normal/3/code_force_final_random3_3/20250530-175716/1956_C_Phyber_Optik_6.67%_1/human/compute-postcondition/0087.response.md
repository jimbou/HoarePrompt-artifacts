To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + r + 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `j` is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`. Since the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be the next value in the range.

The range is defined as `range(1, n + r + 1)`, which means the next value of `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `j` to be `j + 1`.

The other objects in the loop head are `n` and `r`, but their values do not change based on the loop iteration. Therefore, their states remain the same.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`, `r` is either `n` or 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs.**

Note that the state of `j` is now `j + 1`, which means it will take on the next value in the range defined by the loop head.
