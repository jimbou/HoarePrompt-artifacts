Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `sum` is calculated based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`. If this condition is true, `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * n`.
* `r` is also calculated based on the same condition. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`, `r` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `r` is equal to `n - 1`.
* `i` is simply equal to `n + 1`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(sum, n + r)`

The print statement will print two values: `sum` and `n + r`.

* `sum` will be printed as either `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` or `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * n`, depending on the value of `n`.
* `n + r` will be printed as either `n + n` or `n + (n - 1)`, depending on the value of `r`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `sum` and `n + r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **sum (where sum is either n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 or n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * n), n + r (where r is either n or n - 1)**
