Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is 2 and `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the original value of `sum` plus `i * n`. Otherwise, `r` is either 1 or 0 and `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n + i * n` or `i * n + 2 * n + i * n`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its original value. The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` still determines the values of `r` and `sum`. If the condition is true, `r` is 2 and `sum` is the original value plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `i * n`. If the condition is false, `r` is either 1 or 0 and `sum` is either the original value plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `2 * n` plus `i * n` or the original value plus `i * n` plus `2 * n` plus `i * n`.
