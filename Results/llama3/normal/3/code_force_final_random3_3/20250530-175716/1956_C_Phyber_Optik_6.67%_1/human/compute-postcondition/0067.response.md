Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, i is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs. If the product of n and the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of i and n, then sum is greater than or equal to 1 plus n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2, r is 2, and j is either n + 1 or n + 2. Otherwise, sum is either greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * n or equal to 2 * n + i * n, r is either 1 or 0, and j is either n + 1 or n + r.***
