Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise, `i` is `n`, `j` is an integer, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the sum which is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, and `n + r` which is `n + n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n + (n - 1)` otherwise, and 1, and `j` which is an integer that is less than or equal to `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, the sum which is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, and `n + r` which is `n + n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n + (n - 1)` otherwise, and 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` are printed, and the numbers from 1 to `n` are printed.***
