Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 1, i is 1, j is n, stdin contains -2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to be the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The value of `r` has been updated to be the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains -2 inputs.
