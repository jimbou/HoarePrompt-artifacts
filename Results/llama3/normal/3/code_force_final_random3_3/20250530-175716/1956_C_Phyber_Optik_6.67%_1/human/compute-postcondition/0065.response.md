Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, sum is greater than or equal to 1 plus n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2, r is 2, i is 2, j is either n + 1 or n + 2, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 2. The second line increments `sum` by the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than or equal to 1.5. Therefore, `sum` becomes greater than or equal to 1 plus `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2. No other variables are affected.
