Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`, `r` is either `n` or 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, this is printed: 1, the value of `j` which is 1, and a space, and all integers from 1 to `n` are printed. If `j` is greater than `n`, this is printed: `sum` (which is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`) and `n + r` (where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1 and `r` is either `n` or 0), and this is printed: 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` (where `j` is greater than `n` and `n` is an integer that must be at least 1), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.***
