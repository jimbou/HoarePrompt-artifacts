Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 3, i is 2, j is n, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 2, stdin contains -2 inputs.**

The code first assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 2. Then, it increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Since `sum` was initially `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `i * n` otherwise, the new value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, or `i * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` otherwise. No other variables are affected.
