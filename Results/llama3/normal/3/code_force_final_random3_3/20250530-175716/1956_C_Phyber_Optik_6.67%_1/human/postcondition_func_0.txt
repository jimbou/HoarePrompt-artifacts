This function reads a number of test cases from standard input, then for each test case, it reads an integer n and calculates a sum based on the value of n. It then prints the calculated sum and a sequence of numbers for each test case. The sequence of numbers consists of either "1, j" followed by numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) if j is less than or equal to n, or "2, j % n" followed by numbers from 1 to n if j is greater than n. The function repeats this process for each test case.
