The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 1. The second line increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers, which is always greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `sum` becomes greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is greater than or equal to 1, r is 1, i is 1, j is n + 1**
