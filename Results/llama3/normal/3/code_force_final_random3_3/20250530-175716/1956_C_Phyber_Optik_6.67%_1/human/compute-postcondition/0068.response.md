The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`*t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2, `r` is 2, and `j` is either `n` + 1 or `n` + 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * `n` or equal to 2 * `n` + `i` * `n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, and `j` is either `n` + 1 or `n` + `r`.**
