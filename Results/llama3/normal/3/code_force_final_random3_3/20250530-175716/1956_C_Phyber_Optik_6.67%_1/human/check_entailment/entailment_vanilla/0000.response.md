Reasoning:

The problem asks to maximize the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing two types of operations: assigning a permutation to a row or a column. The goal is to find a solution with no more than 2n operations.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over each row and column of the matrix. For each row, it checks if assigning the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] would increase the sum. If it does, it assigns the permutation and updates the sum. It does the same for each column.

However, there are several issues with this program:

1. The program only checks if assigning the permutation [1, 2, ..., n] would increase the sum, but it does not consider other permutations that might lead to a higher sum.
2. The program does not keep track of the actual permutations assigned to each row and column, which is necessary to output the correct operations.
3. The program outputs the sum and the number of operations, but it does not output the actual operations.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible permutations, keep track of the assigned permutations, and output the correct operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import itertools

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = 0
        operations = []
        for p in itertools.permutations(range(1, n + 1)):
            sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    sum += p[(i + j) % n]
            if sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = sum
                operations = [(1, i + 1, p) for i in range(n)] + [(2, j + 1, p) for j in range(n)]
        print(max_sum, len(operations))
        for op in operations:
            print(*op)

func()
```
This corrected program uses the `itertools.permutations` function to generate all possible permutations of the numbers 1 to n. It then checks each permutation to see if it would lead to a higher sum, and if so, updates the maximum sum and the list of operations. Finally, it outputs the maximum sum and the list of operations.

Correctness: **False**
