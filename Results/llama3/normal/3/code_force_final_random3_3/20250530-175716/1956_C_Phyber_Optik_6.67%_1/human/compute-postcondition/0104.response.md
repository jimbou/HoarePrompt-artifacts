Based on the precondition, the print statement `print(*range(1, n + 1))` will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, the sequence will start from 1 and end at `n`.

The `*` operator in the print statement is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments, which will be printed separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n)**
