Postcondition: ***`*t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `stdin` contains -2 inputs, `r` is either `n`, `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, `n + r` is at least 2. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1 3" and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed. Otherwise, 2, the remainder of 3 divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed.***
