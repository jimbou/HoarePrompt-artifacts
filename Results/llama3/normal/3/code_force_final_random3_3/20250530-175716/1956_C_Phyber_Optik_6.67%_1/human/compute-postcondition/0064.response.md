To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same.

The other variables in the state, such as `t`, `_`, `sum`, `r`, `j`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to `i` * `n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `i` is 2, `j` is either `n` + 1 or `n` + `r`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, and either the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n` or the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to the product of `i` and `n`.**
