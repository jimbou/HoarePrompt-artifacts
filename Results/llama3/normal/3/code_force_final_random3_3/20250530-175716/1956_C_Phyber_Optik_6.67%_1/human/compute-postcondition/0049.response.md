Based on the initial state, let's break down the print statement:

`print(2, j % n, end=' ')`

Here, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.

Since `j` is `n + 2`, `j % n` will be the remainder of `n + 2` divided by `n`. Since `n` is at least 1, `n + 2` will always be greater than `n`, so the remainder will be 2.

Therefore, the print statement will print:

* 2 (the literal integer 2)
* 2 (the remainder of `j % n`)
* a space (due to the `end=' '` argument)

Output: **2 2**
