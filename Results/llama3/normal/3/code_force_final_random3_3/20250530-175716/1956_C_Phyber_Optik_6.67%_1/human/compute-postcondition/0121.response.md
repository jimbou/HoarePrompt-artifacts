Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 4, i is 3, j is n, r is 3, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 if n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, otherwise sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n if n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, otherwise sum is i * n + 2 * n.**

The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 3. The second line increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`. Therefore, the value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, otherwise `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n`. No other variables are affected.
