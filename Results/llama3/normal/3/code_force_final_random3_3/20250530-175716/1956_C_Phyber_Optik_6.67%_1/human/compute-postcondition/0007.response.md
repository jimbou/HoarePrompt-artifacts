Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to `i * n`, which is the product of the current value of `i` (1) and the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to the product of `i` and `n` is still valid.
