Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is either greater than or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to n, r is either n or 0, i is n, j is either n + 1 or n + r, stdin contains -1 inputs, and this is printed: sum (which is either greater than or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to n) and n + r (where n is an integer that must be at least 1 and r is either n or 0)
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`, `r` is either `n` or 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, this is printed: 1, the value of `j` which is 1, and a space, and all integers from 1 to `n` are printed. If `j` is greater than `n`, this is printed: `sum` (which is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`) and `n + r` (where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1 and `r` is either `n` or 0), and this is printed: 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` (where `j` is greater than `n` and `n` is an integer that must be at least 1), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`, `r` is either `n` or 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 1`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1, j + 1" is printed, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Otherwise, "2, (j+1) % n" is printed, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`, `r` is either `n` or 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `j + 2`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1, j + 1" is printed, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `j` is greater than `n`, then "2, (j+1) % n" is printed, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, and either "1, j" is printed, where j is j + 2, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed, or "2, j % n" is printed, and the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
