The `print` statement is using the `*` operator to unpack the `range` object into separate arguments. The `range` object is created with the arguments `1` and `n + 1`, which means it will generate numbers from `1` up to, but not including, `n + 1`.

Since `n` is an integer that must be at least `1`, the `range` object will generate numbers from `1` to `n`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will print the numbers from `1` to `n`, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n**
