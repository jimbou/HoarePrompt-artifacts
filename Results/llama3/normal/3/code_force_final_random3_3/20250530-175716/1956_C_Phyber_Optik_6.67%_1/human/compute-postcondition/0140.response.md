The only objects in the loop head are variables  j, n and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables j, n and r. If j is less than n + r + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1, n is at least 1, r is either n, n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, n + r is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time j must be 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n, j is 2, stdin contains -2 inputs, r is either n, n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, n + r is at least 1**
