Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2, i is 3, r is 3, sum is equal to n * (n + 1) // 2 plus the original value of sum, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 3. The second line increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` positive integers. The value of `sum` becomes the original value of `sum` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
