The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin only contains no inputs now. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `sum` and `r`. The value of `t` is an integer greater than 0, and `_` is 0. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, sum is 0, r is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**
