To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, which is already given in the state before the loop starts. However, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be within the range of the loop.

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), we can adjust the state of `i` to be 1, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, stdin contains -2 inputs**
