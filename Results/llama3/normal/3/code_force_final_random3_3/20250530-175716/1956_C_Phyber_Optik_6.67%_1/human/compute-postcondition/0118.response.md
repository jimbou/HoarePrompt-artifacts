Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains -2 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n` and `r` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding `i * n` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `sum` and `r` still depends on the comparison between `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n`.
