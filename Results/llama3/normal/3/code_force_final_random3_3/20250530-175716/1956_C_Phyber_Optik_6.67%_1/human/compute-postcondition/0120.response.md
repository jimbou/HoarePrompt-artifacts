The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`, stdin contains -2 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i * n + 2 * n` and `r` is 0.**
