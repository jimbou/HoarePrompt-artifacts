To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n + r` is at least 1.

State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n, j is 1, stdin contains -2 inputs, r is either n, n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, n + r is at least 1**
