Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations. The program assumes that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers, but it does not consider the fact that the matrix is filled with permutations of numbers from 1 to n.

A counterexample is when n = 3. The program will output a sum of 15 and 4 operations, but the correct maximum sum is 21, which can be achieved with 3 operations.

The correct approach would be to fill the matrix with the largest possible numbers in a way that each row and column contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. This can be achieved by using a different algorithm, such as filling the matrix in a spiral order or using a greedy approach to fill the matrix with the largest possible numbers.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
