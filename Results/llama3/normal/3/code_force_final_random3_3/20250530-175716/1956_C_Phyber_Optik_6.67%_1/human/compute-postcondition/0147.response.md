The `print` statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.

Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, the sequence will start from 1 and end at `n`. The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments, which are then printed separated by spaces.

For example, if `n` is 5, the output will be: 1 2 3 4 5.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer that must be at least 1)**
