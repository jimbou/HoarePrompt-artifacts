Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `i * n + 2 * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The code `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by `i * n`. Since `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer greater than 1, the value of `sum` is increased by `2 * n`. The initial value of `sum` depends on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If this condition is true, `sum` is initially equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, otherwise it is equal to `i * n`. Therefore, the updated value of `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `i * n + 2 * n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
