Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise, `i` is `n`, `j` is an integer that is less than or equal to `n`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, and this is printed: the sum which is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, and `n + r` which is `n + n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n + (n - 1)` otherwise, and 1, and j which is an integer that is less than or equal to n, are printed**
