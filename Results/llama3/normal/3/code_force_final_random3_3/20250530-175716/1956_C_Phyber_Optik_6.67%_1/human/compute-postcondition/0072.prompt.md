Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is 0, r is 0, i is n, j is n + r, stdin contains -1 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
        r = i
        sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
    else:
        sum += i * n


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to i * n, r is either 1 or 0, i is 1, j is either n + 1 or n + r, stdin contains -1 inputs, and either the product of n and the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of i and n or the product of n and the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to the product of i and n

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 2, i is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs. If the product of n and the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of i and n, then sum is greater than or equal to 1 plus n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2, r is 2, and j is either n + 1 or n + 2. Otherwise, sum is either greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * n or equal to 2 * n + i * n, r is either 1 or 0, and j is either n + 1 or n + r.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`*t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2, `r` is 3, and `j` is either `n` + 1 or `n` + 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either greater than or equal to 1 + `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus 3 * `n`, or greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * `n` plus 3 * `n`, or equal to 2 * `n` + `i` * `n` plus 3 * `n`, `r` is either 2, 1, or 0, and `j` is either `n` + 1, `n` + 2, or `n` + `r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
