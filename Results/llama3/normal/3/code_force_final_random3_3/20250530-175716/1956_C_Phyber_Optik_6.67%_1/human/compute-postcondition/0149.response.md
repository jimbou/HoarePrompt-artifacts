Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n, j is 2, stdin contains -2 inputs, r is either n, n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, n + r is at least 1. If j is less than or equal to n, then "1 2 " is printed, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). Otherwise, "2 2 % n" is printed, followed by the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).***
