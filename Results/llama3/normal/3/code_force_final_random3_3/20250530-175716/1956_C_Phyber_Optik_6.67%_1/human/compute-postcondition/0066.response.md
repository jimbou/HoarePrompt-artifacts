Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `sum` is either greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * `n` or equal to 2 * `n` + `i` * `n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `i` is 2, `j` is either `n` + 1 or `n` + `r`, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, and either the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n` or the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to the product of `i` and `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to either greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * `n` or equal to 2 * `n` + `i` * `n` because `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer that must be at least 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
