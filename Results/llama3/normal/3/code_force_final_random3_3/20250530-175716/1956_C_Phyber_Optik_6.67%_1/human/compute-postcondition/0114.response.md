Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, stdin contains -2 inputs. Additionally, `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to `i * n`, which is the product of the current values of `i` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `i`, and `j` are still valid. The stdin still contains -2 inputs.
