Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, r is 2, sum is equal to n * (n + 1) // 2 plus the original value of sum.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 1, as it is not changed by the code. The value of `i` remains 2, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `r` is updated to 2, which is the value of `i`. The value of `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its original value.
