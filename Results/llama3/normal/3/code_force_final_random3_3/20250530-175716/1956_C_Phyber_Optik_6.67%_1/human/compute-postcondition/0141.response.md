Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print(1, j, end=' ')`

Here, `1` is a literal integer value, `j` is a variable with a value of `2` (as specified in the precondition), and `end=' '` is a keyword argument that specifies the separator between the values to be printed.

Since `j` has a value of `2`, the print statement will output the values `1` and `2`, separated by a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 2**
