Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, _ is t, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is either greater than or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 or equal to n times the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to n, r is either n, n - 1, n - 2, ..., 0, i is n, j is n + r, stdin contains -t inputs. If j is less than or equal to n, then "1, j" is printed, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). If j is greater than n, then "2, j % n" is printed, followed by the numbers from 1 to n.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all iterations, with the loop counter `_` equal to the initial value of `t`. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `sum` depends on the value of `n` and can be either greater than or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 or equal to `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus the sum of all integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `r` can be any integer from `n` down to 0. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, and the value of `j` is equal to `n + r`. The standard input `stdin` contains `-t` inputs, indicating that all inputs have been consumed. The output depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`, with either "1, j" followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) or "2, j % n" followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` being printed.
