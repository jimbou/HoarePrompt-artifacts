Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise, `i` is `n + 1`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `sum` will be the sum of the first `n` positive integers if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, or the sum of the first `n` positive integers plus `n * n` otherwise. The value of `r` will be `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, or `n - 1` otherwise. The value of `i` will be `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `t`, `_`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
