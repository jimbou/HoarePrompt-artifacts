Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, sum is 0, r is 0, i is n, j is n + r, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to a new integer value read from stdin, which must be at least 1. The values of `sum` and `r` are reset to 0. The values of `i` and `j` are updated based on the new value of `n`, with `i` becoming equal to `n` and `j` becoming equal to `n + r`, which is now `n` since `r` is 0. Stdin now contains -1 inputs, indicating that one input has been read.
