Postcondition: ***`*t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains -1 inputs. If the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2, `r` is 3, and `j` is either `n` + 1 or `n` + 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either greater than or equal to 1 + `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus 3 * `n`, or greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * `n` plus 3 * `n`, or equal to 2 * `n` + `i` * `n` plus 3 * `n`, `r` is either 2, 1, or 0, and `j` is either `n` + 1, `n` + 2, or `n` + `r`.***
