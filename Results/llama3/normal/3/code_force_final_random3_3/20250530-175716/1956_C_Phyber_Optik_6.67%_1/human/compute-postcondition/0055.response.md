Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus `n * n` otherwise, `r` is `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, `n - 1` otherwise, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + r`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1" and the value of `j` which is `n + r`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed. Otherwise, "2", the remainder of `n + r` divided by `n` which is `r`, and a space, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute `n + r` times, where `r` is either `n` or `n - 1` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`. After each iteration, the value of `j` will be incremented by 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will print "1" followed by the value of `j` and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop will print "2" followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n` (which is `r`) and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The loop will continue until `j` reaches `n + r`.
