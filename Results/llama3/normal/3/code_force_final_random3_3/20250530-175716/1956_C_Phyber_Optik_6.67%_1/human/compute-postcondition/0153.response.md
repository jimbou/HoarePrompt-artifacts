The code prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using the `range` function. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments to the `print` function, which will then print the numbers separated by spaces.

Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer that must be at least 1)**
