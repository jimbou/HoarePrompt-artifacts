The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, n and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n` and `r`. If `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `r` is either `n`, `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, and `n + r` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3, and `n + r + 1` must be greater than 3.
State: **`*t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `stdin` contains -2 inputs, `r` is either `n`, `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, `n + r` is at least 2**
