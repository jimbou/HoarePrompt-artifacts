The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is 2 and `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2` plus the original value of `sum`. Otherwise, `r` is either 1 or 0 and `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `i * n + 2 * n`.**
