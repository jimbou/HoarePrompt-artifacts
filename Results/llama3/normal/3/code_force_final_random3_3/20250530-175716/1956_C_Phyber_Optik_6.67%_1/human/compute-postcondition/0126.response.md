Output: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 1, i is n, j is n, stdin contains -2 inputs. If n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * n and r is n. Otherwise, if n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * (n - 1) + n * (n - 1) and r is n - 1. Otherwise, if n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * (n - 2) + n * (n - 1) + n * (n - 2) and r is n - 2. Otherwise, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * (n - 3) + n * (n - 1) + n * (n - 2) + n * (n - 3) and r is n - 3. The sum and n + r are printed**
