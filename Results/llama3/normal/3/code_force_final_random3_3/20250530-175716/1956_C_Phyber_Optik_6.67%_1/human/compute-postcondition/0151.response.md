The `print` statement will print the values of `1`, `j`, and an empty string (due to the `end=' '` argument) to the console.

The value of `j` is given as `3` in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be the number `1`, followed by the number `3`, and then a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Output: **1 3**
