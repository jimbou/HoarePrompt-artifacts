Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case. It then calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations required to achieve this sum.

The program's logic for calculating the maximum sum is correct. It checks if the sum of the numbers from 1 to n is greater than the product of the current row and n. If it is, it updates the sum and the number of operations. Otherwise, it adds the product of the current row and n to the sum.

The program also correctly prints the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the sequence of operations for each test case. The sequence of operations is generated based on the calculated number of operations and the size of the matrix.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
