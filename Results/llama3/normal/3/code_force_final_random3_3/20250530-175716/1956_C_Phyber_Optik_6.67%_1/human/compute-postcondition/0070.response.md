Output State: **`*t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `sum` is either greater than or equal to 1 + `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus 3 * `n`, or greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * `n` plus 3 * `n`, or equal to 2 * `n` + `i` * `n` plus 3 * `n`, `r` is either 2, 1, or 0, and `j` is either `n` + 1, `n` + 2, or `n` + `r`, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding the product of `i` and `n` to its previous value. The previous value of `sum` was either greater than or equal to 1 plus `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2, or greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * `n`, or equal to 2 * `n` + `i` * `n`. Now, it is either greater than or equal to 1 + `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 plus 3 * `n`, or greater than or equal to 1 + 2 * `n` plus 3 * `n`, or equal to 2 * `n` + `i` * `n` plus 3 * `n`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
