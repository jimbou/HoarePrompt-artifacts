Based on the given precondition, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The value of `n` is an integer that must be at least 1.
2. The value of `i` is equal to `n`.
3. The value of `j` is equal to `n`.
4. The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is evaluated. Since `i` is equal to `n`, this condition simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`, which is always true for `n > 2` (given in the precondition).
5. Since the first condition is true, the value of `sum` is calculated as `n * (n + 1) // 2 * n`.
6. The value of `r` is set to `n`.

Now, let's analyze the `print` statement:

`print(sum, n + r)`

The value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 * n`, and the value of `n + r` is `n + n = 2n`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `sum` followed by the value of `n + r`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) // 2 * n, 2n (where n is the value of n)**
