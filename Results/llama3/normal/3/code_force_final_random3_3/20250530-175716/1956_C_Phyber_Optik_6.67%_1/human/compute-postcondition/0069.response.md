Output State: **`*t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `sum` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2, `r` is 3, `j` is either `n` + 1 or `n` + 2, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `sum`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 3. The second line increments `sum` by the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2. Since `n` is at least 3, the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than or equal to 2, and the product of `n` and this sum is greater than or equal to 6. Therefore, `sum` is greater than or equal to 1 plus `n` times the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2. The values of `*t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing -1 inputs.
