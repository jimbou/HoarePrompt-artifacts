Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
2.  It calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix by iterating over the range from 1 to `n` and adding the product of `n` and the current number `i` to the sum if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`. Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to the sum. This logic is correct based on the problem description.
3.  The program then prints the calculated sum and the number of operations, which is `n + r` where `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
4.  For each operation, the program prints the type of operation (1 or 2), the row or column index, and a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The permutation is generated using the `range` function, which is correct.

The execution summary provided matches the expected behavior of the program based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
