The only variables in the loop head are variable  c, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If c is at least 'a' and at most 'z', the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list, char is the first character in the encoded, and char is not in the mapping does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to c is at least 'a' and at most 'z'.
State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded, `char` is not in the `mapping`, and `c` is at least 'a' and at most 'z'**
