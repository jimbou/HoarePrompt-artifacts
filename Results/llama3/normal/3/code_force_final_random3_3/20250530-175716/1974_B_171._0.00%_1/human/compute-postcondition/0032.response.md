Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list. If `char` is a key in `mapping`, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the first character in the `encoded` string and the character represented by the ASCII value of `c`, where `c` is at most '{', and `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `char` is the second character in the `encoded` string***
