The only variable in the loop head is variable `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is less than or equal to `ord('z')`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is at least 'a' and at most 'z'. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be increased by 1.
State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded, and `c` is at least 'b' and at most 'z'.**
