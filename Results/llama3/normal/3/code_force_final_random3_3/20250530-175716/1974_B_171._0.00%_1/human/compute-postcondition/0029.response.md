Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `decoded` is a list, `c` is at least `ord('c')` and at most `ord('z') + 1`. If the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` is not in the values of the `mapping` dictionary, then a new key-value pair is added to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the character `char`, and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, no changes are made. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
