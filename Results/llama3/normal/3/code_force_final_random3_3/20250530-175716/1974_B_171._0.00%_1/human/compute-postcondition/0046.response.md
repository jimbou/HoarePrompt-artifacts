Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `decoded` is a list containing the character represented by the ASCII value `ord('z') + 1`, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is `ord('z') + 1`, `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string.**

In this output state, the value of `decoded` has been updated to include the character represented by the ASCII value `ord('z') + 1`, which is equivalent to the character '{'. The other variables remain unchanged.
