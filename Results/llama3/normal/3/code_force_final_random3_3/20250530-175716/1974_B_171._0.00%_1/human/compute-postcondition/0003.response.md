The code `decoded.append(mapping[char])` appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the `decoded` list. Since `char` is a key in the `mapping` dictionary, `mapping[char]` is a valid value.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `mapping` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the character `char`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`, and the current value of `char` is a character that exists as a key in the `mapping` dictionary.**

In natural language, the output state is: The `decoded` list now contains the value associated with the character `char` in the `mapping` dictionary, while the other variables remain unchanged.
