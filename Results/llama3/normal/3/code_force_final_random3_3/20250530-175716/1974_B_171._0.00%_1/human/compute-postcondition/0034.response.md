Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` and the first character in the `encoded` string, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string**

In this output state, the value of `decoded` has been updated to include the value of `mapping[char]`, where `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string. The other variables remain unchanged. The `mapping` dictionary still contains each lowercase Latin letter as a key and the first character in the `encoded` string as its value. The `encoded` string remains a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters.
