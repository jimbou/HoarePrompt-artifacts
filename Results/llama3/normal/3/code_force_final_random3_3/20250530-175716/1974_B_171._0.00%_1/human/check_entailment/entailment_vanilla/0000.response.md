Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string. The function uses a dictionary `mapping` to keep track of the mapping between the encoded characters and their corresponding decoded characters.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `num_cases` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `encoded`.
3. It calls the `func_1` function with the encoded string as input and stores the returned decoded string in the `decoded` variable.
4. It prints the decoded string.

Now, let's analyze the `func_1` function:

1. It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping between encoded characters and their corresponding decoded characters.
2. It initializes an empty list `decoded` to store the decoded characters.
3. It iterates over each character `char` in the encoded string.
4. If the character is already in the `mapping` dictionary, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
5. If the character is not in the `mapping` dictionary, it iterates over the range of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' and finds the first letter that is not already in the `mapping` dictionary values. It then adds this letter to the `mapping` dictionary with the encoded character as its value.
6. It appends the decoded character (which is the key in the `mapping` dictionary) to the `decoded` list.
7. Finally, it returns the decoded string by joining the characters in the `decoded` list.

The program seems to be correct in its approach. However, there is a logical error in the `func_1` function. The line `decoded.append(chr(c))` is incorrect because it appends the character that was just added to the `mapping` dictionary, not the decoded character. The correct line should be `decoded.append(chr(c))` should be replaced with `decoded.append(mapping[char])`.

Correctness: **False**
