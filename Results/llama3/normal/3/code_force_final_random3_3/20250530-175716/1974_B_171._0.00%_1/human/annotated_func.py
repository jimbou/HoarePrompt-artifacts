    #State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `decoded` is a list where each element is the first character in the `encoded` string.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that consists of the first character of the `encoded` string repeated for the same number of times as the length of the `decoded` list, where the first character is a lowercase Latin letter.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns a string consisting of the first character of the input string repeated for the same number of times as the length of the input string. The function creates a mapping of each unique character in the input string to the first character of the input string and uses this mapping to generate the output string.
