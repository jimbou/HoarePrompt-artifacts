According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the encoded. If the encoded has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, mapping is an empty dictionary and decoded is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the encoded must have at least 1 character and the char is the first character in the encoded.
State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded**
