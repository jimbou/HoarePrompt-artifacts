Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 1 character, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list. If `char` is a key in `mapping`, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the first character in the `encoded` string and the character represented by the ASCII value of `c`, where `c` is at most '{', and `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list. If `char` is a key in `mapping`, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the first character in the `encoded` string and the character represented by the ASCII value of `c`, where `c` is at most '{', and `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `char` is the second character in the `encoded` string

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `decoded` is a list. If `char` is a key in `mapping`, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]` and the first character in the `encoded` string. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the character represented by the ASCII value `ord('z') + 1` and the first character in the `encoded` string, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
