Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is in the range from `ord('b')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive). If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
