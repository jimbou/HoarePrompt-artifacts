Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `decoded` is a list, `c` is at least `ord('b')` and at most `ord('z')`. If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of the dictionary `mapping`, then `mapping` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.***
