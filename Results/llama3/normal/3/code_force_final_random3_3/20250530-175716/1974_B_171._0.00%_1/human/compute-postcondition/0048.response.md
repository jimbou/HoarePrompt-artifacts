Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `decoded` is a list where each element is the first character in the `encoded` string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `encoded` string remains unchanged, the `mapping` dictionary is populated with all lowercase Latin letters as keys and the first character of the `encoded` string as values, and the `decoded` list contains the first character of the `encoded` string repeated for each character in the `encoded` string.
