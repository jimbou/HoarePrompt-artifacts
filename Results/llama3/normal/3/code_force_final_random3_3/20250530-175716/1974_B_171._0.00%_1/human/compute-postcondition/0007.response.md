Output State: **mapping contains a key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of c and the value is the first character of the encoded string, decoded remains an empty list, encoded remains unchanged, char remains the first character of the encoded string, and c remains unchanged but is now a key in the mapping dictionary.**

In this output state, the mapping dictionary now contains a key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of c and the value is the first character of the encoded string. The decoded list remains empty, as no characters have been decoded. The encoded string remains unchanged, as no modifications have been made to it. The char variable remains the first character of the encoded string, as it was not modified by the code. The c variable remains unchanged but is now a key in the mapping dictionary, as it was used to create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
