Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 1 character, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the first character in the `encoded`, and `c` is at least 'c' and at most '{'. If the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` is not in the values of the `mapping`, then a new key-value pair is added to the `mapping` where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, and the loop is terminated.***
