Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a string of distinct letters in alphabetical order. The decoding process should reverse this operation.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process. It creates a mapping of each unique character in the encoded string to the first character of the encoded string, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach would be to create a mapping of each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character from the string of distinct letters in alphabetical order.

Moreover, the execution summary provided does not match the code. The execution summary describes a function that repeats the first character of the input string for the same number of times as the length of the input string, which is not what the code does.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
