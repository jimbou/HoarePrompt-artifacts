Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the given string `encoded` by replacing each character with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order. However, the function does not correctly implement this logic.

The function creates a dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping between the characters in `encoded` and their corresponding symmetric characters. However, it does not correctly populate this dictionary. Instead of finding the symmetric character for each character in `encoded`, it simply assigns the first character of `encoded` to each character in the dictionary.

As a result, the function returns a string that consists of the first character of `encoded` repeated for the same number of times as the length of `decoded`, which is not the correct decoded string.

Correctness: **False**
