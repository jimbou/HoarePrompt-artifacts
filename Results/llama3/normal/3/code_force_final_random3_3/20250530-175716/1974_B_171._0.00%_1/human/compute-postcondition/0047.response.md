Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `decoded` is a list. If `char` is a key in `mapping`, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]` and the first character in the `encoded` string. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the character represented by the ASCII value `ord('z') + 1` and the first character in the `encoded` string, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string.***
