Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list. If `char` is a key in `mapping`, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the first character in the `encoded` string and the character represented by the ASCII value of `c`, where `c` is at most '{', and `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is in the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive). If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then a new key-value pair is added to `mapping` where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is in the range from `ord('b')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive). If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is in the range from `ord('c')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive). If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
