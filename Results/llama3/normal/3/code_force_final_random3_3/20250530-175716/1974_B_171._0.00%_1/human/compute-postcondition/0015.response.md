Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 1 character, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the first character in the `encoded`, and `c` is at most '{'. The `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `mapping` dictionary will contain all lowercase Latin letters as keys, with each key mapped to the first character of the `encoded` string. The `decoded` list will be empty, and the `char` variable will still be the first character of the `encoded` string. The `c` variable will have reached its maximum value of '{'.
