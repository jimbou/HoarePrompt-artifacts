Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded, and `char` is not in the `mapping`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded, and `c` is at least 'a' and at most 'z'. If the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` is not already a value in the `mapping`, then `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the first character of the `encoded` string. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mapping`, `decoded`, `encoded`, `char`, and `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded, and `c` is at least 'b' and at most 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` is a dictionary with the key-value pair {chr(c): char}.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 1 character, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the first character in the `encoded`, and `c` is at least 'c' and at most '{'. If the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` is not in the values of the `mapping`, then a new key-value pair is added to the `mapping` where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, and the loop is terminated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
