Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`, where `char` is the second character in the `encoded` string, and possibly other characters.**

In this output state, the `decoded` list has been updated to include the value of `mapping[char]`, where `char` is the second character in the `encoded` string. The other variables, `encoded` and `mapping`, remain unchanged. The `decoded` list may also contain other characters that were present before this code was executed.
