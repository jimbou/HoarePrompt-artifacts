To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `c` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `c` is within the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` must be at least `ord('a')` and at most `ord('z')`.

State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list, `c` is at least `ord('a')` and at most `ord('z')`**
