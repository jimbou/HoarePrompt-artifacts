Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `decoded` is a list, `c` is at least `ord('b')` and at most `ord('z')`, `mapping` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`.**

The code snippet updates the `mapping` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair. The key is the character represented by the value of `c`, and the value is `char`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged. The `mapping` dictionary is updated with the new key-value pair.
