Output State: **The mapping dictionary now contains a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the character `char`. The loop is terminated due to the `break` statement. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the mapping dictionary has been updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the character `char`. The loop is terminated due to the `break` statement, so no further iterations will occur. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, and `c` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code snippet.
