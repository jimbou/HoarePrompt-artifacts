Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is in the range from `ord('c')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive), `mapping` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char` if the character represented by `c` was not already in the values of `mapping`.**

In this output state, the value of `mapping` has been updated to include a new key-value pair if the character represented by `c` was not already in the values of `mapping`. The key is the character represented by `c`, and the value is `char`, which is the third character in the `encoded` string. All other variables remain unchanged.
