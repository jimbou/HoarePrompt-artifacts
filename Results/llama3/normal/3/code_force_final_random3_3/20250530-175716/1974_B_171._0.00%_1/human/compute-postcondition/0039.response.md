State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is in the range from `ord('b')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive). If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then a new key-value pair is added to `mapping` where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`.**
