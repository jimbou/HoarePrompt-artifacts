Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `mapping` is a dictionary with the key-value pair {chr(c): char}, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded, and `c` is at least 'b' and at most 'z'.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary, where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c` and the value is the character `char`. Since `c` is at least 'b' and at most 'z', the key will be a lowercase Latin letter. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the `mapping` dictionary, which now contains the additional key-value pair. The `encoded` string, `decoded` list, `char` variable, and `c` variable retain their original values.
