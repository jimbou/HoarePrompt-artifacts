Reasoning:

The given Python program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the input string `encoded` by replacing each character with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order. However, the function does not correctly implement this logic.

The function creates a mapping of each unique character in the input string to the first character of the input string, and then uses this mapping to generate the output string. This is not the correct way to decode the string.

The correct approach would be to first construct the string `r` by finding all distinct letters of the input string in alphabetical order. Then, for each character in the input string, find its symmetric character from the string `r` and replace it with that character.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
```

This function first constructs the string `r` by finding all distinct letters of the input string in alphabetical order. Then, it creates a mapping of each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it uses this mapping to replace each character in the input string with its symmetric character.

Correctness: **False**
