Postcondition: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded, and `c` is at least 'b' and at most 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` is a dictionary with the key-value pair {chr(c): char}.**
