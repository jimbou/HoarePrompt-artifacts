Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`, `decoded` is a list, `c` is at least `ord('a')` and at most `ord('z')`.**

The code adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary, where the key is the character represented by the current value of `c` and the value is `char`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables. The values of `encoded` and `decoded` remain unchanged. The value of `c` remains within the range of `ord('a')` to `ord('z')`, but its exact value is not modified by the code.
