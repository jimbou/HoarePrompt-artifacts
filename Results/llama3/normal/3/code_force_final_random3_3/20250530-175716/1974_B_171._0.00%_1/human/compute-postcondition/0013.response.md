Output State: **mapping has a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of c and the value is the first character in the encoded string, the loop is terminated**.

In this output state, the `mapping` dictionary has been updated with a new key-value pair. The key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c`, which is at least 'c' and at most '{'. The value is the first character in the `encoded` string, which is stored in the `char` variable. The `break` statement terminates the loop, so no further iterations will occur. The `decoded` list remains empty, as it is not modified by the code. The `encoded` string and the `char` variable remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
