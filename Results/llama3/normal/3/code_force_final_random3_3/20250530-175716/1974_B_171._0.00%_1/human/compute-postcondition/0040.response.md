Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is in the range from `ord('b')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive).**

The code adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables. The values of `encoded`, `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged.
