The only variable in the loop head is `char` and `encoded`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `encoded` string. If `encoded` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `encoded` has at least 1 character. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `encoded` must have at least 2 characters and `char` is the second character in the `encoded` string.
State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is a list. If `char` is a key in `mapping`, then `decoded` contains the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` contains the first character in the `encoded` string and the character represented by the ASCII value of `c`, where `c` is at most '{', and `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string, `char` is the second character in the `encoded` string**
