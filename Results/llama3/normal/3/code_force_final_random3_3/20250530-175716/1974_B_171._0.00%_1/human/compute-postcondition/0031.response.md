The code `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends a character to the `decoded` list. The character is determined by the ASCII value `c`, which is `ord('z') + 1`. Since `ord('z')` is 122, `c` is 123. The character with ASCII value 123 is '{'. Therefore, the character '{' is appended to the `decoded` list.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The `encoded` string remains the same, and the `mapping` dictionary remains unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `decoded` is a list with '{' appended to it, `c` is `ord('z') + 1`, and the `mapping` dictionary contains all lowercase Latin letters as keys, and the value for each key is `char`.**
