Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `decoded` is a list, `c` is `ord('z') + 1`. The `mapping` dictionary contains all lowercase Latin letters as keys, and the value for each key is `char`.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `encoded` string and the `decoded` list remain unchanged. The variable `c` has reached the value of `ord('z') + 1`, which is the value immediately after the last lowercase Latin letter in the ASCII table. The `mapping` dictionary has been updated to include all lowercase Latin letters as keys, with each key mapped to the value `char`, which is the second character in the `encoded` string.
