The only variable in the loop head is variable `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is less than `ord('z') + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is at least `ord('b')` and at most `ord('z')`. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be increased by 1. So, `c` is at least `ord('c')` and at most `ord('z') + 1`.
State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 2 characters, `decoded` is a list, `c` is at least `ord('c')` and at most `ord('z') + 1**
