Output State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is `ord('z') + 1`, `mapping` is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the `encoded` string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations means that the loop has iterated over all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. The `encoded` string remains unchanged, and `decoded` is still a list. The `char` variable is still the third character in the `encoded` string. The `c` variable has reached the end of the range, which is `ord('z') + 1`. The `mapping` dictionary has been updated to include all lowercase Latin letters as keys, with their corresponding values being the first character in the `encoded` string.
