Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters that must have at least 1 character, `mapping` is a dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the encoded, and `c` is at least 'a' and at most 'z'. If the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` is not already a value in the `mapping`, then `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is the first character of the `encoded` string. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mapping`, `decoded`, `encoded`, `char`, and `c`.***
