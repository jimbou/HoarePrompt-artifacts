The only variable in the loop head is variable `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is less than `ord('z') + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is in the range from `ord('b')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `c` must be increased by 1.
State: **`encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters with at least 3 characters, `decoded` is a list, `char` is the third character in the `encoded` string, `c` is in the range from `ord('c')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive). If the character represented by `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair where the key is the character represented by `c` and the value is `char`. Otherwise, `mapping` remains unchanged.**
