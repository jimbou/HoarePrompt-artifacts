Functionality: **The function reads multiple pairs of inputs from standard input, where each pair consists of an integer n and a list of n non-negative integers. It then constructs a string r by mapping each integer in the list to a character in the alphabet (a-z) based on its frequency of appearance, and prints the resulting string. The function repeats this process for each pair of inputs, until all input pairs have been processed and standard input is empty.**
