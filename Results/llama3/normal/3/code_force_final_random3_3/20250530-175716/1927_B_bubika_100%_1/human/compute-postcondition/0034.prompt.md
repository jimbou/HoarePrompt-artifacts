Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t, then t pairs of inputs, each pair consisting of an integer n and a list of n non-negative integers.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where each element is equal to the number of times the corresponding character appears in the string r, n is 1, s is a list of n non-negative integers, r is a string of length n where each character is the corresponding character in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' for the non-negative integer in s, stdin is empty, i is the last element in s, and x is the index of the last element in s in b, and the string r is being printed which is the last character of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' corresponding to the last element in s

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where each element is the number of times the corresponding character appears in the string s, n is an integer, s is a list of n non-negative integers, r is a string consisting of the characters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the order they appear in s, stdin is empty, i is the last element in s, and x is the index of the last element in s in b, and the string r is printed which is a string consisting of the characters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the order they appear in s

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is n and the rest are 0, n is an integer greater than the last element in s, s is a list of n non-negative integers, r is a string containing the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times, stdin is empty, i is the last element in s, x is the index of the last element in s in b, and t is the last element in s plus one, and the string r which is the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' repeated n times is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
