The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is the last element in `s`. So for the loop to be executed, `s` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in `s`.

State: **`a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an integer, `s` is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `r` is an empty string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is the first element in `s`, and `x` is the index of the last element in `s` in `b`**
