Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros, n is an integer greater than the last element in s, s is a list of n non-negative integers, r is an empty string, stdin is empty, i is the last element in s, x is the index of the last element in s in b, t is the last element in s plus one, and the input to the function int(input()) is greater than the last element in s.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is 1 and the rest are 0, n is an integer greater than the last element in s, s is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, r is a string containing the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin is empty, i is the first element in s, x is the index of the first element in s in b, and t is the first element in s plus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is 2 and the rest are 0, n is an integer greater than the last element in s, s is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, r is a string containing the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin is empty, i is the second element in s, x is the index of the second element in s in b, and t is the second element in s plus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is 3 and the rest are 0, n is an integer greater than the last element in s, s is a list of n non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, r is a string containing the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' plus the character at index x in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin is empty, i is the third element in s, x is the index of the third element in s in b, and t is the third element in s plus one




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
