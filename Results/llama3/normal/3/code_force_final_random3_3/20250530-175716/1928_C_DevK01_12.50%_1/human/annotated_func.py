    #State: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, `q // i` if `q` is divisible by `i`, `w` is greater than `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to `w // 1`. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also contains `i`. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q // i` is added to `M`. Additionally, if `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q // i` is added to `M` regardless of whether `q` is divisible by `i` or not.
    return M
    #The program returns a list M containing the square root of q if it is greater than or equal to x - 1 and is an integer, q // i if q is divisible by i, i if i is greater than or equal to x - 1 and q is divisible by i, and q // i if q // i is greater than or equal to x - 1, where q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, and i is greater than or equal to w // 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of divisors for a given integer `q`, including its square root if it is an integer, and all other divisors `i` and `q // i` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, where `x` is a given integer less than `q`. The function returns this list of divisors.
