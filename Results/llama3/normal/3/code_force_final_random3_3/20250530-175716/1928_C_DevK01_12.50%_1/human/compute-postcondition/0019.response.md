The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and w, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `w`. If `i` is less than `w // 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `w` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `w` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, `q // i` if `q` is divisible by `i`, `w` is greater than `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to 3. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also contains `i`. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q // i` is added to `M`.**
