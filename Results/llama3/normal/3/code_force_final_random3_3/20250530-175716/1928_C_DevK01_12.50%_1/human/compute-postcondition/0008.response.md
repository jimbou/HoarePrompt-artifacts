Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, otherwise it is an empty list, `w` is greater than 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and the current value of `q` is divisible by `i`.***
