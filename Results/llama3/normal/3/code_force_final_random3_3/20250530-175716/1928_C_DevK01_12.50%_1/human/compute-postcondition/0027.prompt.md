You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q and x are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9.
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: *q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, if the square root of q is greater than or equal to x - 1 and is an integer, then M is a list containing the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
    #State: `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, `q // i` if `q` is divisible by `i`, `w` is greater than `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to `w // 1`. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also contains `i`. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q // i` is added to `M`. Additionally, if `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q // i` is added to `M` regardless of whether `q` is divisible by `i` or not.
    return M
    #The program returns a list M containing the square root of q if it is greater than or equal to x - 1 and is an integer, q // i if q is divisible by i, i if i is greater than or equal to x - 1 and q is divisible by i, and q // i if q // i is greater than or equal to x - 1, where q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, and i is greater than or equal to w // 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list M containing the square root of q if it is greater than or equal to x - 1 and is an integer, q // i if q is divisible by i, i if i is greater than or equal to x - 1 and q is divisible by i, and q // i if q // i is greater than or equal to x - 1, where q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, and i is greater than or equal to w // 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
