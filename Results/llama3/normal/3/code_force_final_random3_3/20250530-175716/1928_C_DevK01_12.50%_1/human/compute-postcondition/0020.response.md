Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, `q // i` if `q` is divisible by `i`, `w` is greater than `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` itself. If `q` is divisible by `i`, then if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also contains `i`. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q // i` is added to `M`.**

In this output state, the list `M` has been updated to include the value of `i`, in addition to its previous contents. The other variables remain unchanged.
