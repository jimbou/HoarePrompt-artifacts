Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, `q // i` if `q` is divisible by `i`, `q // i` is added to `M`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also contains `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `q` and `x` remains the same. The list `M` now contains an additional element, which is the integer division of `q` by `i`. The values of `w` and `i` are unchanged. The list `M` still contains the square root of `q` if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, and `q // i` if `q` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also contains `i`.
