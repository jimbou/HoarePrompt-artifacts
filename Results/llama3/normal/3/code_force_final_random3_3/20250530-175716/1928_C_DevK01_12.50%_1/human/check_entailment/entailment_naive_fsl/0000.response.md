Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. The program first checks if the sum of n and x is even, and if not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. If the sum is even, it calculates the list of possible values for k using the func_1 function and then prints the length of the list after removing duplicates.

The func_1 function calculates the list of possible values for k by iterating over all factors of (n + x - 2) // 2 and (n - x) // 2, and checking if they are greater than or equal to x - 1. This is because k must be greater than or equal to x - 1 to satisfy the condition.

The program also handles the case where n is less than 3x - 2, in which case it only calculates the list of possible values for k using (n + x - 2) // 2.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
