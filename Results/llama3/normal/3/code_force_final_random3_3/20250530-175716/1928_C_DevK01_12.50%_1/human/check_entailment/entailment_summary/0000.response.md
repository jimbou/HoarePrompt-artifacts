Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. The program first checks if the sum of the position and the number received during the settling is even. If it's not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. If it is even, it calls the function func_1 to find the divisors of (y - 2) // 2 and (n - x) // 2 that are greater than or equal to x - 1. The function func_1 correctly generates the list of divisors and the main program correctly prints the length of the set of divisors.

The program also correctly handles the case when n is less than 3 * x - 2 by not calling the function func_1 for (n - x) // 2 in that case.

Correctness: **True**
