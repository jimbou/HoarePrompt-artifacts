Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, `q // i` if `q` is divisible by `i`, `w` is greater than `i`, `i` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` also contains `i`. If `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q // i` is added to `M`. Additionally, `q // i` is added to `M` regardless of whether `q` is divisible by `i` or not.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `q // i` is now always included in the list `M`, regardless of whether `q` is divisible by `i` or not.
