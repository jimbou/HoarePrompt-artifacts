To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `w`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `int(w // 1)`.
2. Since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on values from 1 to `int(w // 1) - 1` (because the range is exclusive of the end value).

Considering the initial state, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `q` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.
* `x` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`.
* `M` remains a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, otherwise it remains an empty list.
* `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
* `i` is now 1, as it will take on values from 1 to `int(w // 1) - 1`.

State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q` if the square root of `q` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and is an integer, otherwise it is an empty list, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
