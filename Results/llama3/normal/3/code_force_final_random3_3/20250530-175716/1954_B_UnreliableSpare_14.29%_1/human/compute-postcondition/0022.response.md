Postcondition: **`ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or infinity, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1, and either the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val` or it is not. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `ans` is either 1 or 2, and `cnt` is either 1 or 2. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `ans` is either 0 or `cnt`, and `cnt` is either 0 or 1.**
