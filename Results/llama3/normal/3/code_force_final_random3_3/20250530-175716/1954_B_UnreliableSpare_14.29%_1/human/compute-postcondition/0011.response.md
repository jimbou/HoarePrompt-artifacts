Output State: **stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, if all elements in arr are equal, then flag is True, otherwise flag is False, and i is n.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the value of `flag` will be `True` if all elements in the list `arr` are equal, and `False` otherwise. The state of `stdin` and `n` remains unchanged.
