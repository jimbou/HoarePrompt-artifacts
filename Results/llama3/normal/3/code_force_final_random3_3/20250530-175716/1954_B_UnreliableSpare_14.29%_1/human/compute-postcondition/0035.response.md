Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or min(n-1, cnt), `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, and i is n. If all elements in arr are equal, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ans (where ans is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or min(n-1, cnt)) is printed.***
