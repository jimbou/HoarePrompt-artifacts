Postcondition: ***`ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2.***
