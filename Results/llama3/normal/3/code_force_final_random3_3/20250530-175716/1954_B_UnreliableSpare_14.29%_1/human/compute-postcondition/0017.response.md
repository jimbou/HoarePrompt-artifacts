Output State: **`ans` is either infinity or `cnt`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the element at index `i` of `arr` is not equal to `val`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value (infinity) and `cnt` (which is 0). The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` blocks of input, and the properties of `n`, `arr`, `flag`, `i`, and the relationship between the element at index `i` of `arr` and `val` are still valid.
