Postcondition: **`ans` is infinity, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**
