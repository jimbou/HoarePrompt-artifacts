The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, if the current value of arr[i] is not equal to the current value of arr[i - 1], then flag is False, otherwise flag remains True, and i is 2**
