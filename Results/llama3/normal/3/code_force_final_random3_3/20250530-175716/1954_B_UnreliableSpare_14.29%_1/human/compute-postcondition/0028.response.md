Output State: **`ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or min(n-1, cnt), `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, if all elements in arr are equal, then flag is True, otherwise flag is False, and i is n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` can now be any integer from 0 to the minimum of n-1 and cnt. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
