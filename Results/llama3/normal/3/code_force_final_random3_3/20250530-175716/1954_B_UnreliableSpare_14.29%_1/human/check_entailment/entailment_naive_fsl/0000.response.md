Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] will return 1, but the correct answer is 2. This is because the program only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements, but it does not consider the case when the elements are alternating.

In this case, the program will return 1, but the correct answer is 2, because we need to remove at least two elements to make the array not beautiful.
