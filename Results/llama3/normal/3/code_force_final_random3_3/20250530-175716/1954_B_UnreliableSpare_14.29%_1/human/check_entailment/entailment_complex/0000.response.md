Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which contains multiple blocks of input. Each block starts with an integer n, followed by n integers.

2. The program checks if all elements in each block are equal by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the previous one. If all elements are equal, the flag is set to True.

3. If the flag is True, the program prints -1, which is the correct output according to the problem statement.

4. If the flag is False, the program finds the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the block. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive equal elements. The minimum count is updated whenever a smaller count is found.

5. The program prints the minimum count of consecutive equal elements, which is the correct output according to the problem statement.

6. The program continues this process until all blocks in the input have been processed.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
