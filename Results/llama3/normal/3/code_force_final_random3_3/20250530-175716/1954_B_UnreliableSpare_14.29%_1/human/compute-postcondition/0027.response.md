Output State: **ans is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, val is the first element of arr, cnt is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, if all elements in arr are equal, then flag is True, otherwise flag is False, and i is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans` will hold the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array `arr`, the variable `val` will still hold the first element of `arr`, the variable `cnt` will hold the total count of occurrences of the first element in `arr`, the variable `stdin` will still contain `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, the variable `n` will still be an integer greater than or equal to 1, the variable `arr` will still be a list of `n` integers, the variable `flag` will still be `True` if all elements in `arr` are equal and `False` otherwise, and the variable `i` will be equal to `n`.
