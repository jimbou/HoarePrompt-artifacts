Output State: **`ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 2**

The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or infinity, the updated value of `ans` will be either 0, 1, or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
