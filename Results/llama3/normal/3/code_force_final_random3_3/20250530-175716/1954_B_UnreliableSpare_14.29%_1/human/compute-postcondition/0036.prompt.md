You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t, then t blocks of input. Each block contains an integer n followed by n integers.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, if all elements in arr are equal, then flag is True, otherwise flag is False, and i is n.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: ans is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n-1, val is the first element of arr, cnt is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, if all elements in arr are equal, then flag is True, otherwise flag is False, and i is n.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: an integer value between 0 and min(n-1, cnt) (inclusive)
    #State: *`ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or min(n-1, cnt), `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, and i is n. If all elements in arr are equal, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ans (where ans is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or min(n-1, cnt)) is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or min(n-1, cnt), `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, all elements in arr are equal, flag is True, and i is n, and -1 is being printed

Case_2: `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or min(n-1, cnt), `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or n, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, not all elements in arr are equal, flag is False, and i is n, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or min(n-1, cnt))


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
