Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If the elements are not all the same, the program then finds the minimum count of consecutive elements that have the same value as the first element in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and updating the minimum count whenever a different element is encountered.

Finally, the program prints the minimum count found, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
