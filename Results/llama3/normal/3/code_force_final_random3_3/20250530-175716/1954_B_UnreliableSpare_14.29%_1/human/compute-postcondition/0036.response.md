Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints a value. It expects the input to contain multiple blocks, each starting with an integer n followed by n integers. The function checks if all elements in each block are equal. If they are, it prints -1. If they are not, it finds the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the block and prints this value. The function continues this process until all blocks in the input have been processed.**
