Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. If the elements are not all equal, it finds the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the array and prints this value. This is because removing this minimum count of elements would make the array not beautiful. The program uses a flag to track if all elements are equal and uses a variable to keep track of the minimum count of consecutive equal elements.

Correctness: **True**
