The code snippet initializes variables `ans`, `val`, and `cnt`. The first line sets `ans` to infinity, represented as a string 'Infinity'. The second line assigns the first element of the list `arr` to `val` and initializes `cnt` to 0.

Output State: **ans is infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, if all elements in arr are equal, then flag is True, otherwise flag is False, and i is n.**
