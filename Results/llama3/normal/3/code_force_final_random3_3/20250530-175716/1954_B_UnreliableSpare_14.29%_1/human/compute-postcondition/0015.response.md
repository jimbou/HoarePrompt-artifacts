Output State: **`ans` is infinity, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` was 0, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operation was performed. The condition that all elements in `arr` are equal or not, and the relationship between `arr[i]` and `val` also remain unchanged.
