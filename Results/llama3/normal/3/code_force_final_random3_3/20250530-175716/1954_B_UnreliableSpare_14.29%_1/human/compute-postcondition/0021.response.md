Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or `cnt`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1, and either the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val` or it is not.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. `ans` can now be either 0 or `cnt`, depending on the previous value of `ans` and the value of `cnt`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
