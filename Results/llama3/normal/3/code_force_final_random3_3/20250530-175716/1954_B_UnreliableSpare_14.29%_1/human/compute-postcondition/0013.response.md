The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`ans` is infinity, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
