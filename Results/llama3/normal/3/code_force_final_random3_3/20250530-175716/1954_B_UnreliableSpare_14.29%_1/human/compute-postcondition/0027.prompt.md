Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans is infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, arr is a list of n integers, if all elements in arr are equal, then flag is True, otherwise flag is False, and i is n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == val:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans` is either infinity or `cnt`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and either the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val` or it is not.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or infinity, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 1, and either the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val` or it is not. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `ans` is either 1 or 2, and `cnt` is either 1 or 2. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, then `ans` is either 0 or `cnt`, and `cnt` is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` blocks of input, each block containing an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, if all elements in `arr` are equal, then `flag` is `True`, otherwise `flag` is `False`, `i` is 2. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
