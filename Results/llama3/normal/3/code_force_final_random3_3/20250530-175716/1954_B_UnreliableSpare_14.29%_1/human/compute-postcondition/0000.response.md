Output State: **stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, flag is True**

The code snippet reads an integer t from stdin, which represents the number of blocks of input. Then, for each block, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers. The value of n is assigned to the variable n, and the list of integers is assigned to the variable arr. The variable flag is set to True. After executing the code, stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers. The variable n holds the value of the last block's n, and arr holds the list of integers from the last block. The variable flag is set to True.
