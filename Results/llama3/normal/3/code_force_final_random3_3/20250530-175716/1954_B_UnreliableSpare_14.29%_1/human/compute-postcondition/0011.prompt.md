Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, flag is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
        flag = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers, if the current value of arr[i] is not equal to the current value of arr[i - 1], then flag is False, otherwise flag remains True, and i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, if the current value of arr[i] is equal to the current value of arr[i - 1], then flag remains True, otherwise flag is False, and i is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains t-1 blocks of input, each block containing an integer n followed by n integers, n is an integer that must be greater than 3, arr is a list of n integers, if the current value of arr[i] is equal to the current value of arr[i - 1], then flag remains True, otherwise flag is False, and i is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
