This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the size of a sequence. For each test case, the function prints a sequence of pairs of numbers, starting with '1 1' and '1 2', followed by either '2 3' if n is 3, or '2 4' and the numbers from 4 to n (inclusive) paired with their corresponding numbers if n is greater than or equal to 4. The function repeats this process t times, consuming all input from standard input.
