Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints a sequence of pairs of numbers, starting with '1 1' and '1 2', followed by either '2 3' if n is 3, or '2 4' and the numbers from 4 to n (inclusive) paired with their corresponding numbers if n is greater than or equal to 4.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is equal to |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. By carefully selecting the pairs of cells, the program is able to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct sequences of pairs for each test case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, it appears that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
