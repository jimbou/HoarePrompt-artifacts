Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, then '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and the numbers from 4 to `t` (inclusive) are printed with their corresponding numbers, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and the values of `j` from 4 to `t` are printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, printing the numbers from 4 to `t` (inclusive) with their corresponding numbers, and the final value of `j` is `n`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
