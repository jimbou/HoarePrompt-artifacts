Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed `t` times, '1 2' has been printed `t` times. If `n` is 3, then '2 3' is printed `t` times. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' is printed `t` times, and the numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with their corresponding numbers `t` times.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, the value of `i` is equal to `t`, the value of `n` is still an integer, and there is no input left in stdin. The numbers '1 1' and '1 2' have been printed `t` times each. If `n` is 3, then '2 3' has been printed `t` times. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' has been printed `t` times, and the numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) have been printed with their corresponding numbers `t` times.
