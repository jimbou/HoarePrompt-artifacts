Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 0. The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer from the input. Since the input is consumed by the `input()` function, the stdin now contains no input.
