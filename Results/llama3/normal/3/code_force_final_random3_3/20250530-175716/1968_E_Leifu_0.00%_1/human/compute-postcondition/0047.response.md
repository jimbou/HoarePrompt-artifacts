Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, then '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and the numbers from 4 to `t` (inclusive) are printed with their corresponding numbers.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to an integer input from the user. Since stdin contains no input, the program will wait for the user to enter an integer. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that `n` is now an integer input by the user.
