The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, then '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and the numbers from 4 to `t` (inclusive) are printed with their corresponding numbers.**
