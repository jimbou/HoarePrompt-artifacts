To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' is printed, '2 4' is printed, `j` is 5, and this is printed: '4 4'**
