To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5.

The state of `n` does not need to be changed, as it is already greater than 4.

The other variables `t`, `i`, and the printed output are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `j` is 5, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2', and this is printed: '2 4', and this is printed: '4 4'**
