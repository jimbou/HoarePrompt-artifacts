Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 6, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
5 5
6 6

However, the correct output for n = 6 should be:

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1

As shown in the note for n = 6 in the problem description. The program does not correctly maximize the size of \mathcal{H} for all values of n.
