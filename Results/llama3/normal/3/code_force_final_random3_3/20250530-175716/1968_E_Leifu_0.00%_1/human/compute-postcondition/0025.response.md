The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is not 3, all the numbers from 1 to 50 are printed along with their squares.**
