Based on the initial state, the code will print the string '2 4'.

Here's the explanation:

* The initial state mentions that if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' is printed.
* The code `print('2 4')` is executed regardless of the value of `n`.
* The string '2 4' is a literal string and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output will be the string '2 4' itself.

Output: **2 4**
