To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 4. Since `n` is an integer not equal to 3, we can adjust its state to be greater than 4. Additionally, `j` will start at 4.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `j` is 4, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2', and this is printed: '2 4'**
