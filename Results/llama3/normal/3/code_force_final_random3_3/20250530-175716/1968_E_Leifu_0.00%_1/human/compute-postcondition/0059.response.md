The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, then '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' is printed, `j` is 5, and the numbers from 4 to `t` (inclusive) are printed with their corresponding numbers, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and the value of `j` which is 5 is printed**
