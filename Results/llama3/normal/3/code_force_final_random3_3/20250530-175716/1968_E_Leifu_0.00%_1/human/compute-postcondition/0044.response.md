The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than or equal to itself, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' is printed, '2 4' is printed, `j` is equal to `n`, and all numbers from 4 to `n` have been printed along with their squares.
