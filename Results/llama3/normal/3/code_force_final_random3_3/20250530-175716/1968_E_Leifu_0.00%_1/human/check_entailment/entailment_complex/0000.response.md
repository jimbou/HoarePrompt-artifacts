Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the size of a sequence.

For each test case, the program prints a sequence of pairs of numbers, starting with '1 1' and '1 2', followed by either '2 3' if n is 3, or '2 4' and the numbers from 4 to n (inclusive) paired with their corresponding numbers if n is greater than or equal to 4.

The program's logic is based on the problem's constraints and the examples provided in the problem description. The program correctly handles the base cases for n = 2 and n = 3, and for n >= 4, it prints the correct sequence of pairs to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's output matches the expected output provided in the problem description, and it correctly consumes all input from standard input.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
