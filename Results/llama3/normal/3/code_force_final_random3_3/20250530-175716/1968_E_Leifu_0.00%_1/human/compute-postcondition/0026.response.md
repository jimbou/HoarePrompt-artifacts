Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is not 3, all the numbers from 1 to 50 are printed along with their squares, and `n` is assigned the value of the input integer.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to the input integer, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same. The stdin is empty, and the previously printed statements are still valid.
