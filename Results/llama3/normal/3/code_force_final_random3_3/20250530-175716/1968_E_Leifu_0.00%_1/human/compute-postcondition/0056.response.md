The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, i is 2, n is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' is printed. If n is 3, then '2 3' is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' is printed, j is n, and the numbers from 4 to t (inclusive) are printed with their corresponding numbers, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and j is now 4. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, then '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, then '2 4' is printed, `j` is 4, and the numbers from 4 to `t` (inclusive) are printed with their corresponding numbers, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed**
