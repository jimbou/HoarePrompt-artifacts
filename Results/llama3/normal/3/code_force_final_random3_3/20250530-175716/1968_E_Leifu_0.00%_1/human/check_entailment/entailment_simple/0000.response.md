Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program first prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for each test case. If n is 3, it prints the coordinate (2, 3). If n is greater than or equal to 4, it prints the coordinate (2, 4) and then prints the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n (inclusive).

The program's logic is based on the observation that the Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is equal to |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. By carefully choosing the coordinates of the cells, the program ensures that the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

For example, when n is 3, the program prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3). The Manhattan distances between these cells are 0, 1, 2, and 3, which is the maximum possible set of distinct Manhattan distances for n = 3.

Similarly, when n is greater than or equal to 4, the program prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n (inclusive). The Manhattan distances between these cells are 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1, which is the maximum possible set of distinct Manhattan distances for n >= 4.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the maximum possible set of distinct Manhattan distances for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
