The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 6 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `j` is 6, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: '1 1', and this is printed: '1 2', and this is printed: '2 4', and this is printed: '4 4', and this is printed: '5 5'**
