Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, key is the last key in the nodes dictionary, i is n-2, s is the first key in the ends list, e is the second key in the ends list, tree is a list containing the first key in the ends list, prev is the first key in the ends list, curr is the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary with a list length of 1.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, key is the last key in the nodes dictionary, i is n-2, s is the first key in the ends list, e is the second key in the ends list, tree is a list containing the first key in the ends list and the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list. If the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list is equal to the first key in the ends list, then prev is the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list and curr is the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list. Otherwise, prev is the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list and curr is the first element in the list of the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list. stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary with a list length of 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, key is the last key in the nodes dictionary, i is n-2, s is the first key in the ends list, e is the second key in the ends list, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary with a list length of 1. If nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, then tree is a list containing the first key in the ends list, the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, and the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list, and curr is the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list. Otherwise, tree is a list containing the first key in the ends list, the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, and nodes[curr][0], and curr is the first element in the list of the current key in the nodes dictionary.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, key is the last key in the nodes dictionary, i is n-2, s is the first key in the ends list, e is the second key in the ends list, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary with a list length of 1, tree is a list containing the first key in the ends list, the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list, and curr. If nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, then prev is the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list, otherwise prev is the first element in the list of the current key in the nodes dictionary and prev must not be equal to e. If nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, then curr is the second element in the list of the current key in the nodes dictionary, otherwise curr is the first element in the list of the current key in the nodes dictionary.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
