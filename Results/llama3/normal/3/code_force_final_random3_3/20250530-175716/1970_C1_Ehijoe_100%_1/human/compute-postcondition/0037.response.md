Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, key is the last key in the nodes dictionary, i is n-2, s is the first key in the ends list, e is the second key in the ends list, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary with a list length of 1, tree is a list containing the first key in the ends list, the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list, and curr. If nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, then prev is the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list, otherwise prev is the first element in the list of the current key in the nodes dictionary and prev must not be equal to e. If nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, then curr is the second element in the list of the current key in the nodes dictionary, otherwise curr is the first element in the list of the current key in the nodes dictionary.***
