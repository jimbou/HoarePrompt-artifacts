Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with at least 1 key, `key` is the first key in the `nodes` dictionary, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains one integer `u`. If the length of the list of the first key in the `nodes` dictionary is 1, then `ends` is a list containing the first key in the `nodes` dictionary. Otherwise, `ends` is an empty list.***
