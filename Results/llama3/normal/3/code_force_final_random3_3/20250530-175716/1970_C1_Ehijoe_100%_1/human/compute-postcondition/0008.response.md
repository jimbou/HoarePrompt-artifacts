Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, where each node is connected to every other node, stdin contains one integer u, i is n-2, ends is an empty list**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n is still between 2 and 2*10^5, t is still 1, edges is still an empty list, empty is still True, nodes is still a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, where each node is connected to every other node, stdin still contains one integer u, i is still n-2, and a new variable ends has been introduced which is an empty list.
