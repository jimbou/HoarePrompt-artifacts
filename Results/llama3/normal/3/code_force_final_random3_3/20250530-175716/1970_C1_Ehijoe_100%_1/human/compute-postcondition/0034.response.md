Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, key is the last key in the nodes dictionary, i is n-2, s is the first key in the ends list, e is the second key in the ends list, stdin is empty, ends is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary with a list length of 1, tree is a list containing the first key in the ends list, the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list, and curr, and curr is the second element in the list of the first key in the ends list if nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, otherwise curr is the first element in the list of the current key in the nodes dictionary and curr must not be equal to e.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the `tree` list has been appended with the value of `curr`. The value of `curr` depends on whether `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`. If it is, then `curr` is the second element in the list of the first key in the `ends` list. Otherwise, `curr` is the first element in the list of the current key in the `nodes` dictionary, and it must not be equal to `e`.
