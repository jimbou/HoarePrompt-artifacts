Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, `key` is the last key in the nodes dictionary, `i` is n-2, `s` is the first key in the ends list, `e` is the second key in the ends list, `tree` is a list containing the first key in the ends list and the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, `prev` is the first key in the ends list, `curr` is the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, `stdin` is empty, `ends` is a list containing all keys in the nodes dictionary with a list length of 1**

In this output state, the value of `tree` has been updated to include the first element in the list of the first key in the ends list, which is `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
