Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with at least 3 keys, `key` is the third key in the `nodes` dictionary, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains one integer `u`. If the length of the list of the first key in the `nodes` dictionary is 1, then `ends` is a list containing the first key in the `nodes` dictionary, the second key in the `nodes` dictionary and the third key in the `nodes` dictionary. Otherwise, `ends` is a list containing the second key in the `nodes` dictionary and the third key in the `nodes` dictionary.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `ends` list has been updated to include the `key` value, which is the third key in the `nodes` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
