Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict of lists with n-1 nodes, where each node is connected to every other node, stdin contains one integer u, i is n-2, ends is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        ends.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with at least 1 key, `key` is the first key in the `nodes` dictionary, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains one integer `u`. If the length of the list of the first key in the `nodes` dictionary is 1, then `ends` is a list containing the first key in the `nodes` dictionary. Otherwise, `ends` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with at least 2 keys, `key` is the second key in the `nodes` dictionary, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains one integer `u`. If the length of the list of the first key in the `nodes` dictionary is 1, then `ends` is a list containing the first key in the `nodes` dictionary and the second key in the `nodes` dictionary. Otherwise, `ends` is a list containing the second key in the `nodes` dictionary.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict of lists with at least 3 keys, `key` is the third key in the `nodes` dictionary, `i` is n-2, `stdin` contains one integer `u`. If the length of the list of the first key in the `nodes` dictionary is 1, then `ends` is a list containing the first key in the `nodes` dictionary, the second key in the `nodes` dictionary and the third key in the `nodes` dictionary. Otherwise, `ends` is a list containing the second key in the `nodes` dictionary and the third key in the `nodes` dictionary.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
