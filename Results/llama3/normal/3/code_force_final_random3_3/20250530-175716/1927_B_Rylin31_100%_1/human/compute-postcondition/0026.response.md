To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in array:`. The objects involved are `j` and `array`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the first element in the `array`. For the loop to execute again, `array` must have at least two elements, and `j` should be the second element in the `array`.

State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an integer equal to the input integer, `s` is a list of integers with length `l` where the jth element is 1 and all other elements are 0, `array` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a string containing the character 'a', `j` is the second element in the `array`, `stdin` contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers**
