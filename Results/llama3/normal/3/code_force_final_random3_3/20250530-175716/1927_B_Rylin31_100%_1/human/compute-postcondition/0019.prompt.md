Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 1, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where all elements are 0, array is a list of integers equal to the input space-separated list of integers, ans is an empty string, j is not defined, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 1, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where all elements are 0 except the first element which is 1, array is a list of integers equal to the input space-separated list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a string containing a single character with ASCII value 98, j is the first element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where all elements are 0 except the first element which is 1 and the second element which is 2, array is a list of integers equal to the input space-separated list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a string containing two characters with ASCII values 98 and 99, j is the second element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 1, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where all elements are 0 except the first element which is 1, the second element which is 2, and the third element which is 1, array is a list of integers equal to the input space-separated list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, ans is a string containing three characters with ASCII values 98, 99, and 98, j is the third element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
