Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a number of test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, l is an integer, s is a list of integers with length l where the jth element is equal to the number of times j appears in the array and all other elements are 0, array is an empty list, ans is a string of length equal to the length of the array where each character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the value of the jth element in s after incrementing, j is the last element in the array, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and the string ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where all elements are 0 except the first element which is 1, the second element which is 2, and the third element which is 1, array is an empty list, ans is a string containing three characters with ASCII values 98, 99, and 98, j is not defined, and the string "bcb" is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 2, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where the jth element is equal to the length of the array and all other elements are 0, array is an empty list, ans is a string containing the characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value 96 plus the length of the array, j is undefined, stdin is empty, and the string "ans" containing characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value 96 plus the length of the array is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
