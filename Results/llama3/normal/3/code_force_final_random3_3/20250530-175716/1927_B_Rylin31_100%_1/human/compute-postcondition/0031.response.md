The code prints the string `ans` which contains the characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value 96 plus the length of the array.
Since the length of the array is 0 (as it is an empty list), the string `ans` contains the characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value 96.
Output: **'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value 96**
