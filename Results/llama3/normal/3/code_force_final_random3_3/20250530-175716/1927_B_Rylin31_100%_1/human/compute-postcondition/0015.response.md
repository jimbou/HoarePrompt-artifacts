The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list  array, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array.  If the array has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, array has at least 1 element, j is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the array must have at least 2 elements and the j is the second element in the list.
State: **`i` is 1, `l` is an integer equal to the input integer, `s` is a list of integers with length `l` where all elements are 0 except the first element which is 1, `array` is a list of integers equal to the input space-separated list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a string containing a single character with ASCII value 98, `j` is the second element in the list.**
