The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list  array, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where all elements are 0, ans is an empty string, stdin contains no input. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the j is the first element in the list.
State: **`i` is 1, `l` is an integer equal to the input integer, `s` is a list of integers with length `l` where all elements are 0, `array` is a list of integers equal to the input space-separated list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string, `j` is the first element in the list, stdin contains no input**
