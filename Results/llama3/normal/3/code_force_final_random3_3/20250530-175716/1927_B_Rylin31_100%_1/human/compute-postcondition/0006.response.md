To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in array:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `j` and `array`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second element in the `array`. For the loop to execute again, `array` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` should be the third element in the `array`.

State: **`i` is 0, `l` is an integer, `s` is a list of integers with length `l` where the jth element is 2 and all other elements are 0, `array` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is a string of length 2 where the first character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s` and the second character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the value of the jth element in `s` after incrementing, `j` is the third element in the `array`, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.**
