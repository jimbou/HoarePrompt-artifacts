The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `array`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `array`. If `array` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `l` is an integer, `s` is a list of zeros with length `l`, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. So for the loop to be executed  the `array` must have at least 1 element and `j` is the first element in the `array`.
State: **`i` is 0, `l` is an integer, `s` is a list of zeros with length `l`, `array` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, `j` is the first element in the `array`**
