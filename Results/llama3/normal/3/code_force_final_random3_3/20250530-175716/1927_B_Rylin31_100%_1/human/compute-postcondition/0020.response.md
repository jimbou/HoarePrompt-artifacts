Based on the precondition, we know that `ans` is a string containing three characters with ASCII values 98, 99, and 98. 

In ASCII, the character with value 98 is 'b', the character with value 99 is 'c', and the character with value 98 is again 'b'. 

Therefore, the string `ans` is "bcb".

When the print statement `print(ans)` is executed, it will print the string "bcb".

Output: **bcb**
