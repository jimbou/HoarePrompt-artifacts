You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a number of test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ans = ''
        
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: i is the number of test cases minus 1, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where the jth element is equal to the number of times j appears in the array and all other elements are 0, array is an empty list, ans is a string of length equal to the length of the array where each character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the value of the jth element in s after incrementing, j is undefined, stdin is empty, and the string "ans" containing characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value 96 plus the length of the array is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: i is the number of test cases minus 1, l is an integer equal to the input integer, s is a list of integers with length l where the jth element is equal to the number of times j appears in the array and all other elements are 0, array is an empty list, ans is a string of length equal to the length of the array where each character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the value of the jth element in s after incrementing, j is undefined, stdin is empty, and the string "ans" containing characters 'a' through the character represented by the ASCII value 96 plus the length of the array is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
