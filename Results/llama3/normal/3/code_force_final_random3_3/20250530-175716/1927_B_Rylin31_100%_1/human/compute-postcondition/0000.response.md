To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute if there is at least one test case in the input. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that there is at least one test case in the input, and `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the range.

State: **stdin contains at least one test case, `i` is 0**
