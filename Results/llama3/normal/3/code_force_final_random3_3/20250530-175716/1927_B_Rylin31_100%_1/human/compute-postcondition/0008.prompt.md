Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 0, l is an integer, s is a list of zeros with length l, array is a list of integers, ans is an empty string, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, l is an integer, s is a list of integers with length l where the jth element is 1 and all other elements are 0, array is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a string of length 1 where the first character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s, j is the first element in the array, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 0, l is an integer, s is a list of integers with length l where the jth element is 2 and all other elements are 0, array is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a string of length 2 where the first character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s and the second character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the value of the jth element in s after incrementing, j is the second element in the array, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 0, l is an integer, s is a list of integers with length l where the jth element is 3 and all other elements are 0, array is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, ans is a string of length 3 where the first character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s, the second character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the value of the jth element in s after incrementing, and the third character is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of 97 plus the incremented value of the jth element in s, j is the third element in the array, stdin contains at least one test case minus two inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
