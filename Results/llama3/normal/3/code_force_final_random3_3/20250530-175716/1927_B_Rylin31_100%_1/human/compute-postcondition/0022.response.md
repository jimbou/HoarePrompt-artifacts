To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the input integer. If `i` is less than the input integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and the input integer is stored in `l`, which is an integer equal to the input integer.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The input integer `l` remains the same, as it is not changed by the loop.

The other variables `s`, `array`, `ans`, and `j` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an integer equal to the input integer, `s` is a list of integers with length `l` where all elements are 0 except the first element which is 1, the second element which is 2, and the third element which is 1, `array` is an empty list, `ans` is a string containing three characters with ASCII values 98, 99, and 98, `j` is not defined**
