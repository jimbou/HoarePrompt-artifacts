Functionality: **This function reads a number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then generates a string where each character corresponds to the lowercase letter represented by the ASCII value 97 plus the count of the corresponding integer in the list, and prints this string. The function repeats this process for each test case, consuming all input from standard input.**
