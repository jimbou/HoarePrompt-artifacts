Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-3`, cards is a list of `n` integers, dp is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `dp[n-3][n-1]` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, The current value of `j+1` does not exist in the list `cards`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`, which is 0. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of `j+1` still does not exist in the list `cards`.
