Postcondition: ***dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-4 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is -3, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`, and `cards` contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[-3][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[-2][n-1]` and `dp[-1][n-2] + 1`. If `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[-3][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[-2][n-1]`, `dp[-1][n-2] + 1`, and `dp[-2][n]`.***
