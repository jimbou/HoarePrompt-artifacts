Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-2`, `i` is `n-3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-2][0]`, `dp[n-3][n-1]` which are 0, `dp[n-3][n-2]` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. Since `i` is `n-3` and `j` is `n-2`, `dp[i][j]` is `dp[n-3][n-2]` and `dp[i + 1][j]` is `dp[n-2][n-2]`. However, the value of `dp[n-2][n-2]` is not specified in the initial state, but since `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-2][0]`, `dp[n-3][n-1]` which are 0, we can infer that `dp[n-2][n-2]` is 0. Therefore, `dp[n-3][n-2]` is also 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
