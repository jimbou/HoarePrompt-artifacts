Output State: **dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-3 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is -2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `0`. If the current value of `j + 1` is not present in the `cards` list, dp[-2][0] is equal to dp[-1][0]. If there is at least one card with the value of `j + 1`, dp[-2][0] is the maximum of dp[-1][0], dp[0][-1] + 1, and dp[-1][1] if there is more than one card with the value of `j + 1`, otherwise it is the maximum of dp[-1][0] and dp[0][-1] + 1.**

This output state represents the final state of the dynamic programming table `dp` after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates over the range `n-1` to `-1` (inclusive) in reverse order, and for each iteration, it updates the values in the `dp` table based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The final state of the `dp` table is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where all elements are initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0. The value of `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` for all `i` and `j` where `0 <= i <= n-3` and `0 <= j <= n-1`. The variable `i` is set to `-2`, and `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` is set to `0`. If the current value of `j + 1` is not present in the `cards` list, `dp[-2][0]` is equal to `dp[-1][0]`. If there is at least one card with the value of `j + 1`, `dp[-2][0]` is the maximum of `dp[-1][0]`, `dp[0][-1] + 1`, and `dp[-1][1]` if there is more than one card with the value of `j + 1`, otherwise it is the maximum of `dp[-1][0]` and `dp[0][-1] + 1`.
