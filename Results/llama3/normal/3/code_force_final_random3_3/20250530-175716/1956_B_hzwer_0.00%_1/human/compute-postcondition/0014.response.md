Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-2`, `i` is `n-3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-2][0]`, `dp[n-3][n-1]` which are 0, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Note that `i` and `j` are still equal to `n-3` and `n-2` respectively, and `dp` is still a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with the same initial values except for `dp[i][j]`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
