Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-3 and 0 <= j <= n-2, `i` is -2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-2`. If the current value of `j + 1` is not present in the `cards` list, dp[-2][n-2] is equal to dp[-1][n-2]. If there is at least one card with the value of `j + 1`, dp[-2][n-2] is the maximum of dp[-1][n-2], dp[0][n-3] + 1, and dp[-1][n-1] if there is more than one card with the value of `j + 1`, otherwise it is the maximum of dp[-1][n-2] and dp[0][n-3] + 1.***
