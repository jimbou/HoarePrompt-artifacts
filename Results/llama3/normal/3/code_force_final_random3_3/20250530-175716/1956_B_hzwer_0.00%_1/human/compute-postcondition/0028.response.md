Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-3 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is -2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, and the current value of `j + 1` is not present in the `cards` list, and dp[-2][n-1] is equal to dp[-1][n-1].**

In natural language, the output state is: The 2D list `dp` remains the same as before, with all elements initialized to 0 except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0. The value of `dp[i][j]` is still the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` for all `i` and `j` where `0 <= i <= n-3` and `0 <= j <= n-1`. The value of `i` is still -2, `n` is still greater than 0, and `j` is still `n-1`. Additionally, the current value of `j + 1` is still not present in the `cards` list. The only change is that `dp[-2][n-1]` is now equal to `dp[-1][n-1]`.
