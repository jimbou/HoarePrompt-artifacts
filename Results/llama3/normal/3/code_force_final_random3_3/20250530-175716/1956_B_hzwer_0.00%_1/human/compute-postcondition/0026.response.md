According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `j`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is -2, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is now `n-1`. 
State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-3 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is -2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`**
