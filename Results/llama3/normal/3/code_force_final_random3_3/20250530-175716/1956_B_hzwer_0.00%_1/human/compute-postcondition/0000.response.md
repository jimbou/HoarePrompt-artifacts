Output State: **n is an integer, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was read from the first line of a test case in stdin. The list `cards` contains `n` integers that were read from the second line of the test case in stdin. The 2D list `dp` has been initialized with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]`, which are both set to 0. Stdin now contains one less test case than initially, as one test case has been read and processed.
