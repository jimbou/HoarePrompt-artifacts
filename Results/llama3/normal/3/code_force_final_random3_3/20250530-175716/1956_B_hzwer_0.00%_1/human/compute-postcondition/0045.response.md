Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-3 and 0 <= j <= n-2, `i` is -2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-3`. If the current value of `j + 1` is not present in the `cards` list, dp[-2][n-3] is equal to dp[-1][n-3]. If there is at least one card with the value of `j + 1`, dp[-2][n-3] is the maximum of dp[-1][n-3], dp[0][n-4] + 1, and dp[-1][n-2] if there is more than one card with the value of `j + 1`, otherwise it is the maximum of dp[-1][n-3] and dp[0][n-4] + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the 2D list `dp` has been updated according to the given formula, where each element `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain the same, and the conditions for `dp[-2][n-3]` are still dependent on the presence of `j + 1` in the `cards` list.
