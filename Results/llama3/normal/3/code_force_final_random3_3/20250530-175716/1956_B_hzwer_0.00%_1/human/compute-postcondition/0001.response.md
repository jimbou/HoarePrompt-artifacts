The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 4 and i is now n-3.
State: **n is at least 4, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is n-3**
