The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` must be `n-3` and `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-3 and 0 <= j <= n-2, `i` is -2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-3`. If the current value of `j + 1` is not present in the `cards` list, dp[-2][n-3] is equal to dp[-1][n-3]. If there is at least one card with the value of `j + 1`, dp[-2][n-3] is the maximum of dp[-1][n-3], dp[0][n-4] + 1, and dp[-1][n-2] if there is more than one card with the value of `j + 1`, otherwise it is the maximum of dp[-1][n-3] and dp[0][n-4] + 1.**
