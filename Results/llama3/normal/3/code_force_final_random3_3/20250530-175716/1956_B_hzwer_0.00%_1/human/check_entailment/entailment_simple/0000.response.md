Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dp array is used to store the maximum points that can be scored for each subproblem. The program iterates over the cards in reverse order and for each card, it checks the number of occurrences of the card in the hand. If the card does not occur in the hand, the maximum points that can be scored is the same as the maximum points that can be scored for the next card. If the card occurs once in the hand, the maximum points that can be scored is the maximum of the maximum points that can be scored for the next card and the maximum points that can be scored for the next next card plus one. If the card occurs more than once in the hand, the maximum points that can be scored is the maximum of the maximum points that can be scored for the next card, the maximum points that can be scored for the next next card plus one, and the maximum points that can be scored for the next card plus one. The program returns the maximum points that can be scored for the first card, which is the maximum points that can be scored for the entire hand.

Correctness: **True**
