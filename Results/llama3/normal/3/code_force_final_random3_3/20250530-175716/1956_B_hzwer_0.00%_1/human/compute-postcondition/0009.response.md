Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `dp[n-3][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-1]`, `dp[n-1][n-2] + 1`, and `dp[n-2][n]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is `n-3`. The number `j + 1` exists in the list `cards` more than once.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of three values: the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`, the value of `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` plus 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The number `j + 1` still exists in the list `cards` more than once.
