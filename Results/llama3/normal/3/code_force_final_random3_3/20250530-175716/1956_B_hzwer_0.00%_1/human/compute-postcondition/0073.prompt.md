Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
        elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-3 and 0 <= j <= n-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-3 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is -2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `0`. If the current value of `j + 1` is not present in the `cards` list, dp[-2][0] is equal to dp[-1][0]. If there is at least one card with the value of `j + 1`, dp[-2][0] is the maximum of dp[-1][0], dp[0][-1] + 1, and dp[-1][1] if there is more than one card with the value of `j + 1`, otherwise it is the maximum of dp[-1][0] and dp[0][-1] + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-4 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is -3, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `0`. If the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i + 1][j]. If `cards` contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1], and dp[i + 2][j] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`. dp[-3][0] is equal to dp[-2][0] if `cards` contains no occurrence of `j + 1`, otherwise dp[-3][0] is the maximum of dp[-2][0], dp[-1][-1] + 1, and dp[-2][1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[-2][0], dp[-1][-1] + 1, dp[-2][1], and dp[-1][0] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
