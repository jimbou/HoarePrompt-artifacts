Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-4 and 0 <= j <= n-1 except for `i` is -3 and `j` is `n-1` where dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i + 1][j]. `i` is -3, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`. The current value of `j` is `n-1`. The number of occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is that the 2D list `dp` has been updated such that the value at position `dp[i][j]` where `i` is -3 and `j` is `n-1` is now equal to the value at position `dp[i + 1][j]`. All other values in the `dp` list remain the same. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` also remain the same, and the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards` is still 0.
