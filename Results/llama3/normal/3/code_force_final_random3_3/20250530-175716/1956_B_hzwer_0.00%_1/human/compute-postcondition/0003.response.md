Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`, cards is a list of `n` integers, dp is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is `n-3`. The current value of `j+1` does not exist in the list `cards`.**
