Output State: **dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-4 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is -3, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `0`. If the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i + 1][j]. If `cards` contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1], and dp[i + 2][j] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`. dp[-3][0] is equal to dp[-2][0] if `cards` contains no occurrence of `j + 1`, otherwise dp[-3][0] is the maximum of dp[-2][0], dp[-1][-1] + 1, and dp[-2][1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[-2][0], dp[-1][-1] + 1, dp[-2][1], and dp[-1][0] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1**.

This output state represents the final state of the 2D list `dp` after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates over the range `n-1` to `-1` (inclusive) in reverse order, and for each iteration, it updates the elements of `dp` based on the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. The final state of `dp` reflects the maximum values that can be obtained by considering all possible combinations of elements in `cards`.
