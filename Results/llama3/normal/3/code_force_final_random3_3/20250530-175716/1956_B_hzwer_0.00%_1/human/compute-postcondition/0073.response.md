Output State: **dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= 0 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is `0`. If the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i + 1][j]. If `cards` contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1], and dp[i + 2][j] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`. dp[0][0] is equal to dp[1][0] if `cards` contains no occurrence of `j + 1`, otherwise dp[0][0] is the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, and dp[1][1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, dp[1][1], and dp[2][0] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a 2D list `dp` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where `n` is the number of cards. The elements of `dp` are initialized to 0 except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0. The loop iterates over the range `n-3` to `-1` in reverse order, and for each iteration, it updates the elements of `dp` based on the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, and `dp[i + 2][j]` if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`. The final value of `dp[0][0]` is determined based on the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards`.
