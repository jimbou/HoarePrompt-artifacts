Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= n-4 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is -3, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`, and `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, and `dp[-3][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[-2][n-1]`, `dp[-1][n-2] + 1`, and `dp[-2][n]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The 2D list `dp` has been updated such that the value at `dp[-3][n-1]` is now the maximum of the values at `dp[-2][n-1]`, `dp[-1][n-2] + 1`, and `dp[-2][n]`. The rest of the elements in `dp` remain the same. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `cards` are unchanged.
