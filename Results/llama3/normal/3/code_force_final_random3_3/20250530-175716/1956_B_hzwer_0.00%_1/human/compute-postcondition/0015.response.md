Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-2`, `i` is `n-3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-2][0]`, `dp[n-3][n-1]` which are 0, `dp[n-3][n-2]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-2]`, `dp[n-1][n-3] + 1`, `dp[n-2][n-1]`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated based on the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
