Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is `n-3`. The number `j + 1` exists in the list `cards`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, then `dp[n-3][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-1]` and `dp[n-1][n-2] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, then `dp[n-3][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-1]`, `dp[n-1][n-2] + 1`, and `dp[n-2][n]`.***
