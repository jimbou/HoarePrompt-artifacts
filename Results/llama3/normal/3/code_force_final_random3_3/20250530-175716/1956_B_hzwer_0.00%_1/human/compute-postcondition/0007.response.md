Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers containing the number `j + 1` exactly once, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `dp[n-3][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-1]` and `dp[n-1][n-2] + 1`, `i` is `n-3`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated based on the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `dp[n-3][n-1]` is now the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-1]` and `dp[n-1][n-2] + 1`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
