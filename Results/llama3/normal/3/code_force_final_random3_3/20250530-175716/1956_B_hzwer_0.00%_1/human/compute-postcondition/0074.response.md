Output State: **The program returns dp[0][0], which is the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, and dp[1][1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, dp[1][1], and dp[2][0] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`.**

In natural language, the program returns the value of dp[0][0], which represents the maximum value that can be obtained based on the occurrences of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, the returned value is the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, and dp[1][1]. If `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, the returned value is the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, dp[1][1], and dp[2][0].
