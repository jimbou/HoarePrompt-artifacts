Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-3`, `i` is `n-3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-2][0]`, `dp[n-3][n-1]`, `dp[n-3][n-2]` which are 0. If `cards` contains `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `cards` does not contain `j + 1`, then `dp[n-3][n-2]` is 0. Otherwise, `dp[n-3][n-2]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-2]`, `dp[n-1][n-3] + 1`, `dp[n-2][n-1]`. `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
