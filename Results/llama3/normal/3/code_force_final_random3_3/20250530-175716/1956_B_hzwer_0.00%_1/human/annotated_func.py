#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, and dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] for all i and j where 0 <= i <= 0 and 0 <= j <= n-1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is `0`. If the number of occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then dp[i][j] is equal to dp[i + 1][j]. If `cards` contains at least one occurrence of `j + 1`, then dp[i][j] is the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1], and dp[i + 2][j] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`. dp[0][0] is equal to dp[1][0] if `cards` contains no occurrence of `j + 1`, otherwise dp[0][0] is the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, and dp[1][1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, dp[1][1], and dp[2][0] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns dp[0][0], which is the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, and dp[1][1] if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, or the maximum of dp[1][0], dp[2][-1] + 1, dp[1][1], and dp[2][0] if `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from a given set of cards, where each card has a value between 1 and n (inclusive), and each value can appear at most twice. The function takes no arguments, but reads input from standard input, which contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers representing the values of the cards. The function returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the cards in each test case.
