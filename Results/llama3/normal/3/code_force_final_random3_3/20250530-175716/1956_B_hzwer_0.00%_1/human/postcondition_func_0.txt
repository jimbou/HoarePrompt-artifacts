This function calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from a given set of cards, where each card has a value between 1 and n (inclusive), and each value can appear at most twice. The function takes no arguments, but reads input from standard input, which contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers representing the values of the cards. The function returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the cards in each test case.
