Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is at least 4, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n-1][0] and dp[n-2][0] which are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, i is n-3
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1. If `j+1` does not exist in the list `cards`, then `dp[n-3][n-1]` is 0. If `j+1` exists in the list `cards`, then `dp[n-3][n-1]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-1]`, `dp[n-1][n-2] + 1`, and if `j+1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n-2][n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-2`, `i` is `n-3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-2][0]`, `dp[n-3][n-1]` which are 0. If `cards` contains `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `cards` does not contain `j + 1`, then `dp[n-3][n-2]` is 0. Otherwise, `dp[n-3][n-2]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-2]`, `dp[n-1][n-3] + 1`, `dp[n-2][n-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `j` is `n-3`, `i` is `n-3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[n-1][0]`, `dp[n-2][0]`, `dp[n-3][n-1]`, `dp[n-3][n-2]` which are 0. If `cards` does not contain `j + 1`, then `dp[n-3][n-2]` is 0. If `cards` contains `j + 1` exactly once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `cards` contains `j + 1` more than once, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. Otherwise, `dp[n-3][n-2]` is the maximum of `dp[n-2][n-2]`, `dp[n-1][n-3] + 1`, `dp[n-2][n-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
