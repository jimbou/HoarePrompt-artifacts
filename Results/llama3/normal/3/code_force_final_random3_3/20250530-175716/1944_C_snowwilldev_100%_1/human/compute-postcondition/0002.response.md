The value of `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is the first element of the list `a`. The value of `cnt[a[i]]` was initially 0, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[0]]` equal to 1 and default value 0 for other keys, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**
