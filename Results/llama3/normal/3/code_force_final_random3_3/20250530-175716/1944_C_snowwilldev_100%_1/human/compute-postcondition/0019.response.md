The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list, then `t` is 2. Otherwise, `t` is 1. Additionally, `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0.**
