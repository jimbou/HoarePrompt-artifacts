#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n). 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with cnt[a[i]] equal to the number of occurrences of a[i] in a for all i in range(N), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is N-1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is `N`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and either `t` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that occur only once in the entire list, or the loop has returned a value `i` such that `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of an integer N followed by a list of N integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and returns the smallest integer that either occurs more than once or does not occur at all in the list. If no such integer is found, it returns N. The function processes one test case at a time, and the input stream is expected to contain multiple test cases.
