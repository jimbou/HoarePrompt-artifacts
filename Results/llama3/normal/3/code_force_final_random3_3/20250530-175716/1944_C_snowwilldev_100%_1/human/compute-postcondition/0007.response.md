Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with cnt[a[i]] equal to the number of occurrences of a[i] in a for all i in range(N), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is N-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

* N remains an integer, but its value does not change.
* a remains a list of N integers, and its contents do not change.
* cnt becomes a dictionary where each key is an element from the list a, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that element appears in the list a.
* stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus one.
* i is now equal to N-1, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
