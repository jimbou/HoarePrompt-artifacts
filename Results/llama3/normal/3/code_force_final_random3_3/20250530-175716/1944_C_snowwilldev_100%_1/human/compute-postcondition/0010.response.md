Postcondition: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1, meaning that the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list.**
