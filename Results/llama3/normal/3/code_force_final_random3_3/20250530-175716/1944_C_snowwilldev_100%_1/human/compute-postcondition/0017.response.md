Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and either `t` is 2 if the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list, or `t` is 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs more than once in the entire list. Additionally, `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list, then `t` is now 2. If the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs more than once in the entire list, then `t` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
