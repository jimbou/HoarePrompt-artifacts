Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of `t` is either 2 or more, or the count of the element at index `i` in list `a` is 0, or both. If `t` is 1, the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list, otherwise, if `t` is 0, the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs more than once in the entire list.***
