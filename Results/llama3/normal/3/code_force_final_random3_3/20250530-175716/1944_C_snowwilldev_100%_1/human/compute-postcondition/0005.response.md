State: **`N` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[0]]` equal to 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` equal to 1 (if `a[1]` was already a key) or `cnt[a[1]]` equal to 1 (if `a[1]` was not a key) and `cnt[a[2]]` equal to 1 (if `a[2]` was already a key) or `cnt[a[2]]` equal to 1 (if `a[2]` was not a key), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2**
