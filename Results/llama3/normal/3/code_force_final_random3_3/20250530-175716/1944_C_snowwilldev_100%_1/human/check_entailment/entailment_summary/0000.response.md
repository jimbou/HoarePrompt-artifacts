Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The program counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and returns the smallest integer that either occurs more than once or does not occur at all in the list. This is because Alice's optimal strategy is to pick the smallest integer that occurs more than once, and Bob's optimal strategy is to pick the smallest integer that occurs only once. If no such integer is found, the program returns N, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the list.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. It also efficiently processes the input and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
