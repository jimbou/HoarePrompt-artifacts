Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is `N-1`, `t` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `N` remains the same, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The list `a` still contains `N` integers. The dictionary `cnt` still keeps track of the number of occurrences of each element in `a`. The value of `i` remains `N-1`. A new variable `t` is introduced and assigned the value 0. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
