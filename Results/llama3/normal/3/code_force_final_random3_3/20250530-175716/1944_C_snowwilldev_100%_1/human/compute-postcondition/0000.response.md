Output State: **N is an integer, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, N is an integer that was read from the first line of the test case. The list 'a' contains N integers that were read from the second line of the test case. The dictionary 'cnt' is initialized with a default value of 0, but its contents are not modified by the given code snippet. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, since one test case has been read and processed.
