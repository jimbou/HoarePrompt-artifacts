Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game's strategy to maximize the score. The key insight is that Alice wants to maximize the MEX of her array `c`, which means she wants to include as many small numbers as possible. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, which means he wants to remove as many small numbers as possible.

The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `a`. Then, it iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N` (the size of the input array) and checks if the count of each number is 1. If it finds a number with a count of 1, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` reaches 2 or if the count of a number is 0, it returns the current number `i` as the MEX of `c`.

This strategy is correct because Alice will always choose the smallest available number that has not been chosen by Bob, and Bob will always choose the smallest available number that has not been chosen by Alice. By doing so, they will maximize the MEX of `c`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the input array is empty or contains only one element. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
