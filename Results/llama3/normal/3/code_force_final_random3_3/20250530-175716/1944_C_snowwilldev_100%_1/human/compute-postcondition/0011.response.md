Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 0, `t` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1, meaning that the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `N` integers, and the dictionary `cnt` still keeps track of the occurrences of each element in `a`. The index `i` is still 0, and the value of `cnt[i]` is still 1, indicating that the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
