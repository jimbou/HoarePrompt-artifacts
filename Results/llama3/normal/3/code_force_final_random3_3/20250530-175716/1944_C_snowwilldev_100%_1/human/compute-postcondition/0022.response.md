Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is `N`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and either `t` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that occur only once in the entire list, or the loop has returned a value `i` such that `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `N`, which is the length of the list `a`. The value of `t` will be equal to the number of elements in `a` that occur only once in the entire list, unless the loop has returned a value `i` such that `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is equal to 0. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and stdin, remains unchanged.
