Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with `cnt[a[i]]` equal to the number of occurrences of `a[i]` in `a` for all `i` in range(`N`), `i` is 2, `t` is either 3 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list, then `t` is 3. Otherwise, `t` is 2. Additionally, `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` in list `a` occurs only once in the entire list, then `t` is now 3. Otherwise, `t` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
