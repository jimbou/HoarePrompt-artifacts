Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into a regular polygon with n sides. The given program attempts to solve this problem.

The program first reads the number of test cases t. Then, for each test case, it reads the number of sides n, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen x, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen y (which is always 0 in this version of the problem). It then reads the x vertices chosen by Bessie.

The program then simply prints x - 2 as the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

The reasoning behind this is that if x vertices are chosen, the maximum number of non-intersecting diagonals that can be formed is x - 2. This is because each diagonal requires two vertices, and the first diagonal can be formed using the first two vertices, the second diagonal can be formed using the second and third vertices, and so on, until the (x - 2)th diagonal can be formed using the (x - 2)th and (x - 1)th vertices. The xth vertex cannot be used to form a diagonal because it would intersect with one of the previously formed diagonals.

Therefore, the program is correct in printing x - 2 as the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Correctness: **True**
