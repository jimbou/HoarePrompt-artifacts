The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of t needed to have been equal or greater than 2 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value and the original value of t is greater or equal to 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and x - 2 is printed**
