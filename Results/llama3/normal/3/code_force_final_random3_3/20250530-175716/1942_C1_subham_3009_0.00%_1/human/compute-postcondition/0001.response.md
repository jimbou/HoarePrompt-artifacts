Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The program has read the number of test cases `t` from the input, and `t` is now an integer. The remaining input contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line of each test case contains three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `n` is between 4 and 10^9, `x` is between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5, and `y` is 0. The second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers between 1 and `n`.
