Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of t is greater or equal to 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and x - 2 is printed**

The code first decrements the value of t by 1, making it two less than its original value. Then, it reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, x, and y, respectively. The value of y is now an integer, but its exact value is not specified. The code then reads a list of x distinct integers from stdin and assigns them to arr. The list contains integers from 1 to n. Since x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), the list arr will have a length between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5). The value of x - 2 is printed, but this does not affect the state of any variables. Finally, stdin now contains t-3 test cases.
