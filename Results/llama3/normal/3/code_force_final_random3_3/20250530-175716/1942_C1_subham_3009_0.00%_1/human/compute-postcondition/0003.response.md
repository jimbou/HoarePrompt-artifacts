Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, making it one less than its original value. The second line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. Since `y` is 0, it remains unchanged. The third line reads `x` distinct integers from stdin and assigns them to `arr`. The fourth line converts the elements of `arr` to integers. After the execution of the code, `t` is one less than its original value, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `arr` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases.
