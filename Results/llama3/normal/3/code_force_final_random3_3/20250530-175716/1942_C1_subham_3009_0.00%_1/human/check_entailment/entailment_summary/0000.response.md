Reasoning:

The problem statement requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into a regular polygon with n sides. The given program simply prints the value of x - 2 for each test case, where x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

The key insight here is that the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed is directly related to the number of vertices chosen. Specifically, if x vertices are chosen, then x - 2 non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake can be formed. This is because each vertex can be connected to every other vertex to form a diagonal, and each diagonal can be used to form a triangle with two other vertices. Since there are x vertices, there are x - 2 possible diagonals that can be formed, and each diagonal can be used to form a triangle.

The program correctly implements this insight by simply printing the value of x - 2 for each test case. The execution summary confirms that the program reads the input correctly and prints the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
