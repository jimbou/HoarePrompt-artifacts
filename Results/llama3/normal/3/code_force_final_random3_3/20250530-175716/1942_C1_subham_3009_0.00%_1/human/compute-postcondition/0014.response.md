Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin is empty, and the value of x - 2 is printed for each test case.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The values of n, x, and y will still be within their specified ranges, and arr will still be a list of distinct integers from 1 to n. The stdin will be empty, as all test cases will have been read and processed. Finally, the value of x - 2 will have been printed for each test case.
