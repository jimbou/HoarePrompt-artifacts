The code prints the value of `x - 2`, where `x` is an integer between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5.

Since `x` is an integer between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5, `x - 2` will be an integer between 0 and the minimum of `n - 2` and 2 * 10^5 - 2.

Output: **an integer between 0 and the minimum of n - 2 and 2 * 10^5 - 2**
