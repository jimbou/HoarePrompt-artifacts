Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing no more than y other vertices, given that Bessie has already chosen x vertices. Since y is 0, we cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake is determined solely by the x vertices chosen by Bessie.

The program correctly calculates this by printing x - 2 for each test case. This is because with x vertices, we can form at most x - 2 non-intersecting triangles. For example, with 4 vertices, we can form 2 non-intersecting triangles, and with 5 vertices, we can form 3 non-intersecting triangles.

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct output. There are no errors or logical flaws in the program.

Correctness: **True**
