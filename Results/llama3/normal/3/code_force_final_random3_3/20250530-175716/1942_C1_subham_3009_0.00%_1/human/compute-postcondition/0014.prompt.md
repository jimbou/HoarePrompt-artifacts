Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    print(x - 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and x - 2 is printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0 and is two less than its original value and the original value of t is greater or equal to 2, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and the value of x - 2 is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is at least 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the value of x - 2 is printed, where x - 2 is an integer between 0 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) - 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
