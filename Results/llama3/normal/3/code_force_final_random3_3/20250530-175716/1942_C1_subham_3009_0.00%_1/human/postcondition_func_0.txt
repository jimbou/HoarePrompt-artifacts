This function reads test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is between 4 and 10^9, x is between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. For each test case, the function prints the value of x - 2, which is an integer between 0 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) - 2. The function continues reading and processing test cases until there are no more test cases in standard input.
