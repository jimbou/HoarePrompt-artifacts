Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list a and values are their respective counts, cur is -adv, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order that must have at least 1 element, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv, ans is a list containing adv values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1, i is greater than 0, adv is greater than or equal to 0, and j is adv - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `counter`, `a`, `i`, `adv`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `cur` is decremented by `adv`, resulting in a new value of `-adv`. The value of `cnt` is also decremented by `adv`, resulting in a new value of `cnt - adv`. The list `ans` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
