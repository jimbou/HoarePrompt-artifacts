Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It modifies the list by adding the index plus one to each element, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and then constructs a new list by appending elements from the sorted list and filling in gaps with consecutive integers. The function prints the constructed list, which contains all possible values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise a list containing all possible values equal to a[0], followed by the remaining elements in descending order, with the last element repeated cnt times, where cnt is the difference between the original list length and the length of the sorted list.**
