Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is increased by 2, the third element is increased by 4, each integer between 3 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 2) is increased by `i + 1` (which is 3), so the third element of the list `a` is increased by 4. The other elements of the list `a` and the values of `n`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged.
