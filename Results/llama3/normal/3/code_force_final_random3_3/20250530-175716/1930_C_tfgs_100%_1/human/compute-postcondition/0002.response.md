Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is increased by 1, each integer between 2 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `a[0]` is increased by 1, so it is now between 2 and 10^9. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, but the first element has been incremented. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, and the value of `i` remains 0.
