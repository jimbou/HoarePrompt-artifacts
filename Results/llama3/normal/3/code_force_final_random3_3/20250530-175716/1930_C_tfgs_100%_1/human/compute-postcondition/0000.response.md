Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, which is the range specified in the initial state. The value of `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9, which is also the range specified in the initial state. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, because one test case has been processed by the code.
