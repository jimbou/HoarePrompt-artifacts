Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1**

The code appends a new value to the list `ans`, which is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Since `i` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1]` is a valid element in the list `a`. The value of `j` is 1, so the new value appended to `ans` is `a[i - 1] - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
