To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `adv`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `adv - 1` (since `j` is `adv - 1` if `i` is greater than 0). To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Additionally, `adv` is at least 1 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. Since `adv` is at least the previous value of `adv`, it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing adv + 2 values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing 2 values equal to a[0], `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `adv` is at least 1 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least the previous value of adv, and `j` is adv**

Note that only the state of `j` has been adjusted, as it is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be updated for the loop to execute again.
