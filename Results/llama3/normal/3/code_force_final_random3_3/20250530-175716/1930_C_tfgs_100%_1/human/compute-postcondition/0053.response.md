Output State: **The loop has executed `cnt` times, and the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans` has been appended with `ans[-1] - 1` `cnt` times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has run `cnt` times, and the only change to the initial state is that the list `ans` has been extended by appending `ans[-1] - 1` to it `cnt` times. All other variables remain unchanged.
