Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` is `adv - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ans` will contain `adv` values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, where `j` ranges from 0 to `adv - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
