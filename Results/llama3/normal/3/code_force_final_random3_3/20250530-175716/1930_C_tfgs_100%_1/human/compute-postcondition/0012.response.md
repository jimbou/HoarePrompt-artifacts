According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `adv`. If `adv` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. So for the loop to be executed, `adv` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0**
