The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list.

Since the loop has executed `cnt` times, and in each iteration, `ans` has been appended with `ans[-1] - 1`, the list `ans` will contain a sequence of decreasing numbers.

The initial state of `ans` is not specified, but let's assume it was initialized with some value, say `x`. After the first iteration, `ans` will be `[x, x-1]`. After the second iteration, it will be `[x, x-1, x-2]`, and so on.

After `cnt` iterations, the list `ans` will contain `cnt+1` elements, with the last element being `x-cnt`.

Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list, which is a sequence of decreasing numbers starting from the initial value `x` and decreasing by 1 in each step, until the last element `x-cnt`.

Output: **x, x-1, x-2, ..., x-cnt (where x is the initial value of ans and cnt is the number of times the loop has executed)**
