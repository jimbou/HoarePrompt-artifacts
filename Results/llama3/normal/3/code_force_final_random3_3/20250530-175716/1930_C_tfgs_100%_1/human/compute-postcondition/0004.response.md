Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is increased by 2, each integer between 3 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) has been increased by `i + 1` (which is 2), so the first element of the list `a` is now increased by 2. The other elements of the list `a` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `stdin`, and `i` are not affected by the code.
