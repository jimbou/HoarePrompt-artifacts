Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -`adv` + `counter[a[i]]` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` is `counter[a[i]]`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` + 1 values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing 1 value equal to `a[0]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is equal to the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and `j` is `adv` - 1 if `i` > 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(adv):
    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -`adv` + `counter[a[i]]` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` is `counter[a[i]]`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` + 2 values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing 2 values equal to `a[0]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is equal to the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and is at least 1, and `j` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -`adv` + `counter[a[i]]` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` is `counter[a[i]]`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` + 3 values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing 3 values equal to `a[0]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is equal to the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and is at least 1, and `j` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -`adv` + `counter[a[i]]` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` is `counter[a[i]]`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` + 4 values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing 4 values equal to `a[0]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is equal to the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and is at least 2, and `j` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
