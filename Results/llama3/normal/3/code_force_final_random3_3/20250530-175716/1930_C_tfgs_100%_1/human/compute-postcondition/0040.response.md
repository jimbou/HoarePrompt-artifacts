The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `adv`. If `j` is less than `adv`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `adv`, so for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `adv` and `adv` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing adv + 3 values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing 3 values equal to a[0], `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `adv` is at least 2 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least the previous value of adv, and `j` is less than `adv`**
