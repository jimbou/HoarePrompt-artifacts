To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `a` is a sorted list of unique integers that must have at least 1 element.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must have at least one more element. Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -`adv` + `counter[a[i]]` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` is `counter[a[i]]`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` + 1 values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing 1 value equal to `a[0]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` is `adv` - 1 if `i` > 0**
