Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is greater than 0, indicating that it is not the first test case.**
