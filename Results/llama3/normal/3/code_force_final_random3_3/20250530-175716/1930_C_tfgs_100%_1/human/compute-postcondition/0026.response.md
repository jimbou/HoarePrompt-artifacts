To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `adv`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `adv`. If `adv` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `adv` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `adv` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -`adv` + `counter[a[i]]` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` is `counter[a[i]]`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` + 2 values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing 2 values equal to `a[0]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is equal to the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and is at least 1, and `j` is 1**
