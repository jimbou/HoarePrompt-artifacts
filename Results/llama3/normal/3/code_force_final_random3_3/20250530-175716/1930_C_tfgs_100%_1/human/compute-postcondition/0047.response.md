The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `cnt`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt`. If `cnt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `cnt` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all possible values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing all possible values equal to a[0], `i` is -1, `adv` is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least the previous value of adv if i > 0, otherwise adv is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is less than adv if i > 0, otherwise j is adv - 1, `cnt` is reduced by adv if i > 0, and cur is reduced by adv if i > 0, ans now includes a[i], counter[a[i]] is reduced by 1, and cur is increased by the new value of counter[a[i]], `_` is 0**
