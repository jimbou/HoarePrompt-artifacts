Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list a and values are their respective counts, cur is 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is an empty list, i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        cur -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1
    cur += counter[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list a and values are their respective counts, cur is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order that must have at least 1 element, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is a list containing adv + 1 values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing 1 value equal to a[0], i is greater than or equal to 0, adv is greater than or equal to 0, and j is adv - 1 if i > 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list a and values are their respective counts, cur is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is a list containing adv + 1 values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing 1 value equal to a[0], i is greater than or equal to 1, adv is greater than or equal to 0, and j is adv - 1 if i > 0. If i > 0, adv is updated to the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least adv.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list a and values are their respective counts, cur is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is a list containing all possible values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing all possible values equal to a[0], i is greater than or equal to 2, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least the previous value of adv if i > 0, otherwise adv is greater than or equal to 0, j is less than adv if i > 0, otherwise j is adv - 1, cnt is reduced by adv if i > 0, and cur is reduced by adv if i > 0, ans now includes a[i], counter[a[i]] is reduced by 1, and cur is increased by the new value of counter[a[i]].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
