Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains between 1 and 3 * 10^5. The dictionary `counter` still contains the unique integers from the list `a` as keys and their respective counts as values. The variable `cur` remains 0. The list `a` is still sorted in descending order and contains at least one element. The number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` is still stored in `cnt`. The list `ans` now contains three values: `a[i - 1] - j - 1` (which was already present), `a[i - 1] - j - 1` (which was already present), and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` (which is the new value appended). The values of `i`, `adv`, and `j` remain the same, with `i` being greater than 0, `adv` being greater than 2, and `j` being 2.
