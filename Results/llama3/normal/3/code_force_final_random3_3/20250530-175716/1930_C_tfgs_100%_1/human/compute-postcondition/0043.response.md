Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list a and values are their respective counts, cur is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is a list containing all possible values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing all possible values equal to a[0], i is greater than or equal to 2, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least the previous value of adv, j is less than adv, cnt is reduced by adv, and cur is reduced by adv.**
