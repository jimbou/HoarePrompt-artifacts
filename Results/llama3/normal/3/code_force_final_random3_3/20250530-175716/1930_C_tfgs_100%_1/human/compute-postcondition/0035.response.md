Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing adv + 1 values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing 1 value equal to a[0], `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `adv` is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least the previous value of adv, and `j` is adv - 1 if i > 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `adv` is updated to be the minimum of the difference between the current and previous elements in the list `a` minus 1, the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus the previous value of `adv` if `i` is greater than 0, and the current value of `cur`. The value of `adv` is also at least its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
