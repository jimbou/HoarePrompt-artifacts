Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -`adv` + `counter[a[i]]` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cur` is `counter[a[i]]`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` > 0, otherwise `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` + 3 values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `ans` is a list containing 3 values equal to `a[0]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is equal to the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and is at least 1, and `j` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ans` now contains one more value, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i` > 0, otherwise `a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
