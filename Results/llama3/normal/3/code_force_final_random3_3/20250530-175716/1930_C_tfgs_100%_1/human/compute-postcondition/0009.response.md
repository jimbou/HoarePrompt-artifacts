To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, we can infer that `a` is not empty. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first index of `a`, which is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
