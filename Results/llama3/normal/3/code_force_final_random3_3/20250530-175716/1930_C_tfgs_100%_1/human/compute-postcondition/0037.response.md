Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing adv + 2 values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing 2 values equal to a[0], `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `adv` is at least 1 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least the previous value of adv, and `j` is adv - 1 if i > 0**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated to include an additional value of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1` if `i > 0`, otherwise it includes an additional value equal to `a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
