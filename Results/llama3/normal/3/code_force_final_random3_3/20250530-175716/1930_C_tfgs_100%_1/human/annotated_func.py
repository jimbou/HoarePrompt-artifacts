#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers, where each element at index i is increased by i + 1, each integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list a and values are their respective counts, cur is -adv + counter[a[i]] if i > 0, otherwise cur is counter[a[i]], a is an empty list, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing all possible values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise ans is a list containing all possible values equal to a[0], i is -1, adv is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and is at least the previous value of adv if i > 0, otherwise adv is greater than or equal to 0, j is less than adv if i > 0, otherwise j is adv - 1, cnt is reduced by adv if i > 0, and cur is reduced by adv if i > 0, ans now includes a[i], counter[a[i]] is reduced by 1, and cur is increased by the new value of counter[a[i]].
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `cnt` times, and the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `ans` has been appended with `ans[-1] - 1` `cnt` times.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: x, x-1, x-2, ..., x-cnt (where x is the initial value of ans and cnt is the number of times the loop has executed)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It modifies the list by adding the index plus one to each element, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and then constructs a new list by appending elements from the sorted list and filling in gaps with consecutive integers. The function prints the constructed list, which contains all possible values of the form a[i - 1] - j - 1 if i > 0, otherwise a list containing all possible values equal to a[0], followed by the remaining elements in descending order, with the last element repeated cnt times, where cnt is the difference between the original list length and the length of the sorted list.
