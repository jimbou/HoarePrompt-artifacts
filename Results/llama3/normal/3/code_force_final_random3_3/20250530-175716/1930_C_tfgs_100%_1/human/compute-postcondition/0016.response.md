To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for j in range(adv):`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it is defined by the `range(adv)` function.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `adv` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `adv` must be greater than the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is 2
* `adv` must be greater than 2

The other variables in the program state, such as `n`, `counter`, `cur`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
