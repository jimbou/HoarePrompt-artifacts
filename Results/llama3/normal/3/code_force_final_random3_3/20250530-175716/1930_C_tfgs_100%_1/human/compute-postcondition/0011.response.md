Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the list `a` and values are their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 element, `cnt` is the number of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than 0, and `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`.**

In this output state, the value of `adv` is calculated based on the minimum difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list `a`, the number of duplicate integers `cnt`, and the current value `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.
