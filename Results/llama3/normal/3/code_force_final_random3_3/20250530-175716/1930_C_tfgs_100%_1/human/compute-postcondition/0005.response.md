The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the first element is increased by 2, each integer between 3 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases, `i` is 2**
