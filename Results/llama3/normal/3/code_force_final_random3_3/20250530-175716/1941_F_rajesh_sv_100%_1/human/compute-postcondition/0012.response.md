Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, and n is greater than 2, max_diff is equal to diff, next_max_diff is equal to the original max_diff, and index is equal to i which is 2.**

The code snippet updates the values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index`. The first line assigns the original value of `max_diff` to `next_max_diff`. The second line assigns the value of `diff` to `max_diff`. The third line assigns the value of `i` to `index`. Since `i` is 2, `index` becomes 2. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged.
