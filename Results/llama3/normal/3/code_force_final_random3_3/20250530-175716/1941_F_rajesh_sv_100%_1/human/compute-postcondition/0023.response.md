Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, and ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for the introduction of three new variables: left, right, and ans. The values of left and right are determined by the elements in list A at the index of the maximum difference and the one before it, respectively. The value of ans is set to the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, which is stored in max_diff.
