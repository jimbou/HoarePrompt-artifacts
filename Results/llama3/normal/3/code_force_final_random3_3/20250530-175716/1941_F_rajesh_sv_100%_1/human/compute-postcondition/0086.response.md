Output State: **l is equal to mid + 1, h is greater than l, mid is greater than l - 1 and less than h, mid is equal to (l - 1) + (h - (l - 1)) // 2, mid_sum is equal to D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is equal to D[mid + 1] + f**

In this output state, the value of l has been updated to mid + 1. The other variables maintain their previous relationships, with h still being greater than l, and mid still being greater than l - 1 and less than h. The value of mid is still equal to the average of l - 1 and h, and mid_sum and mid_next_sum maintain their previous values based on the updated mid.
