Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, and index is the index of the maximum difference in A.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as positive integers, and the lists `A`, `D`, and `F` also remain unchanged. However, the variables `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` are updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in list `A`. Specifically, `max_diff` is set to the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is set to the second maximum difference, and `index` is set to the index of the maximum difference in `A`.
