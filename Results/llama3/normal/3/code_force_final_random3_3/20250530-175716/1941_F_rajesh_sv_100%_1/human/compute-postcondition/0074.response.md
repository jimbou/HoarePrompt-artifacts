Postcondition: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one and must be greater than l, mid is equal to l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is equal to D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is equal to D[mid + 1] + f, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, F has at least two more elements, f is the next next element in F. The current value of mid_sum minus left is less than the current value of right minus mid_next_sum.**
