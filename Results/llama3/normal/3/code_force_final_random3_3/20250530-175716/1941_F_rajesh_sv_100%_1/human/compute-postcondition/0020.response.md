Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `diff` is equal to `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is equal to `A[3] - A[2]`.***
