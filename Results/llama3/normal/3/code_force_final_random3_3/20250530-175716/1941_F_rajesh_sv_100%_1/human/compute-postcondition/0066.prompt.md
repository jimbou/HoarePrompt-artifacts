Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the middle index between l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, F has at least one more element, f is the next element in F
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: l and h are updated based on the comparison between mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, l is updated to be the average of the initial l and h plus 1, and h remains greater than l. Otherwise, l is updated to be less than mid, and mid is updated to be the average of l and mid. In both cases, mid_sum and mid_next_sum are updated accordingly, and the difference between mid_sum and left is compared to the difference between right and mid_next_sum to determine the next update.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *l and h are updated based on the comparison between mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum, and h must be greater than l. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to be the average of the old l and the old h. In both cases, mid is the average of the updated l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: l and h are updated based on the comparison between mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum, and h must be greater than l + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
