Output State: **`testcases` is a value returned by `func_3()` that must be greater than 1 and `func_6()` has been executed twice.**

The code snippet simply calls the function `func_6()`, which has already been executed once before. The execution of this function again does not affect the value of `testcases`, which remains the same as before. The only change is that `func_6()` has now been executed twice.
