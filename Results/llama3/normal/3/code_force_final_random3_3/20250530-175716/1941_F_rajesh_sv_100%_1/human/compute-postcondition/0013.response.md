Output State: **`n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, and n is greater than 2. If the difference between the first two elements of A is greater than max_diff, then max_diff is updated to this difference, next_max_diff is updated to A[2] - A[1], and index is set to 1. Otherwise, max_diff remains -inf, next_max_diff is updated to A[2] - A[1], and index remains None, and i is 2`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, m, k, A, D, F, and the condition that n is greater than 2 remain unchanged. The value of next_max_diff is updated to the difference between the second and third elements of A (A[2] - A[1]), while the values of max_diff and index depend on the initial difference between the first two elements of A. If this difference is greater than max_diff, max_diff is updated to this difference and index is set to 1. Otherwise, max_diff remains -inf and index remains None. The value of i remains 2.
