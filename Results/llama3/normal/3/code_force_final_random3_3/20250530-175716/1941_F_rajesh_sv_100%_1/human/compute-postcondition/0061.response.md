To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition `l < h`. Given that `h` must be greater than `l` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to maintain this relationship for the next iteration.

Since `l` and `h` are updated based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, we need to consider the possible updates to `l` and `h`.

1. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. In this case, we need to ensure that `h` is still greater than the updated `l`. Since `h` is not updated in this case, we need to maintain the condition that `h` is greater than `mid + 1`.
2. If `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` is updated to be the average of the old `l` and the old `h`. In this case, we need to ensure that the updated `h` is still greater than `l`. Since `l` is not updated in this case, we need to maintain the condition that the updated `h` is greater than the current `l`.

In both cases, we need to maintain the condition that `h` is greater than `l`. Therefore, we can conclude that:

State: **l and h are updated based on the comparison between mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum, and h must be greater than l + 1**
