Postcondition: ***l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D with respect to f, such that if mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1 and h remains the insertion point for right - f minus one. Otherwise, h is updated to mid and l remains less than mid, with mid being the average of l and h, mid_sum being the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum being the sum of D[mid + 1] and f, and l is less than h.***
