Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `diff` is equal to `A[3] - A[2]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only new information is the value of `diff`, which is calculated as the difference between the 4th element of `A` (`A[3]`) and the 3rd element of `A` (`A[2]`).
