Output State: **`n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, and n is greater than 2. If the difference between the first two elements of A is greater than max_diff, then max_diff is updated to this difference, next_max_diff remains -inf, and index is set to 1. Otherwise, max_diff remains -inf, next_max_diff is updated to the difference between the first two elements of A if this difference is greater than next_max_diff, and index remains None, and i is 2, diff is equal to A[2] - A[1]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of n, m, k, A, D, F, max_diff, next_max_diff, and index remain the same as in the initial state. The variable i is still 2. A new variable diff is introduced, which is equal to the difference between the second and third elements of list A.
