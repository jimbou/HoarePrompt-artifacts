Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, n is greater than 3, i is 3, diff is equal to A[3] - A[2], next_max_diff is equal to max_diff, max_diff is equal to diff, and index is equal to i.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `max_diff` to `next_max_diff`, the value of `diff` to `max_diff`, and the value of `i` to `index`. Since `diff` is equal to `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` becomes equal to `A[3] - A[2]`. The value of `next_max_diff` is now equal to the original value of `max_diff`, but since the original value of `max_diff` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. The value of `index` is now equal to `i`, which is 3. No other variables are affected.
