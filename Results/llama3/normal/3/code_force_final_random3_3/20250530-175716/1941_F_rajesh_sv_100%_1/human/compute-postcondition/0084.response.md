According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `h` are updated to maintain the sorted order of `D` with respect to `f`, and `l` is less than `h`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `l` must be less than `h` after the update. Since `l` is updated to `mid + 1` or remains less than `mid`, and `h` is updated to `mid` or remains the insertion point for `right - f minus one`, we need to ensure that `mid + 1` is less than `mid` or `l` remains less than `mid`. This can be achieved by making `mid` greater than `l` and less than `h`. Additionally, `h` must remain greater than `l` after the update.

State: **`l` and `h` are updated to maintain the sorted order of `D` with respect to `f`, such that `mid` is greater than `l` and less than `h`, and `h` is greater than `l`**
