Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, mid is the middle index between l and h, mid_sum is the sum of the middle element in D and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of the next element in D and f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid.***
