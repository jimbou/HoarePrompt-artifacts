Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `mid` is equal to `l`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, which is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[h] + f - left` and `right - D[h] - f`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of two expressions involving `D[l]`, `f`, `left`, and `right`. Since `l` is equal to `h`, the expressions can also be written in terms of `D[h]`. The values of `l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.
