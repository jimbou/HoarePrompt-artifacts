Postcondition: **l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D with respect to f, such that l is the insertion point for left - f and h is the insertion point for right - f minus one, and the minimum value of ans is updated based on the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, considering the condition that mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum to determine whether to update l or h.**
