Postcondition: **l and h are updated based on the comparison between mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum, and h must be greater than l + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid.**
