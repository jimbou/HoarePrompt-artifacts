According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `h` are updated based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `l` is still less than `h` after the update.

Since `l` is updated to be the average of the initial `l` and `h` plus 1 in one case, and to be less than `mid` in the other case, we can conclude that `l` will always be less than or equal to `h` after the update. However, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `l` is strictly less than `h`.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `h` remains greater than `l` after the update.

State: **`l` and `h` are updated based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, and `h` must be greater than `l`**
