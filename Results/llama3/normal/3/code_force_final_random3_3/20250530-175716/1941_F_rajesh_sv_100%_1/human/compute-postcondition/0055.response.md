Postcondition: **l and h are updated based on the comparison between mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, l is updated to be the average of the initial l and h plus 1, and h remains greater than l. Otherwise, l is updated to be less than mid, and mid is updated to be the average of l and mid. In both cases, mid_sum and mid_next_sum are updated accordingly, and the difference between mid_sum and left is compared to the difference between right and mid_next_sum to determine the next update.**
