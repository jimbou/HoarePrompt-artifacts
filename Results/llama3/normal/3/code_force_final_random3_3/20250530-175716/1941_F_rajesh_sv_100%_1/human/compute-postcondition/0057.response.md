Output State: **l and h are updated based on the comparison between mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum, and h must be greater than l, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `h` are updated based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`. The value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `l` and `h`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are calculated based on the values of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`. The value of `h` is still greater than `l`.
