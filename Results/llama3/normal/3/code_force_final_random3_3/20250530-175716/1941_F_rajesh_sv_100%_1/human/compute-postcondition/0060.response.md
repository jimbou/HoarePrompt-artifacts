Postcondition: ***l and h are updated based on the comparison between mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum, and h must be greater than l. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to be the average of the old l and the old h. In both cases, mid is the average of the updated l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.***
