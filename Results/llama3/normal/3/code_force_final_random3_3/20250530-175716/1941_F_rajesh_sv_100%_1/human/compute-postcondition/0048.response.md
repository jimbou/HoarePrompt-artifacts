Output State: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the middle index between l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, F has at least one more element, f is the next element in F**
