Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `mid` is equal to `l`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `F` has at least one more element, `f` is the next element in `F`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. This means that `ans` now holds the minimum value between its previous value and the maximum of the two expressions `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `l` still equal to `h`, `mid` still equal to `l`, `mid_sum` still equal to `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` still equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, `F` still has at least one more element, and `f` is still the next element in `F`.
