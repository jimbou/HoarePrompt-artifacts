Output State: **l is updated to mid + 1, h is the insertion point for right - f minus one, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f, and l is less than h.**

In this output state, the value of l has been updated to mid + 1, while the values of h, mid, mid_sum, and mid_next_sum remain unchanged. The relationship between l and h, where l is less than h, is still maintained.
