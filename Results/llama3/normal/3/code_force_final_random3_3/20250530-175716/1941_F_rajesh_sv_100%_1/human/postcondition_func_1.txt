This function takes in a tuple of values (args), a dictionary (d), and a function (func) as inputs. It checks if the tuple of values (args) is already a key in the dictionary (d). If not, it calls the provided function (func) with the values in the tuple (args) as arguments, stores the result in the dictionary (d) with the tuple (args) as the key, and returns the result. If the tuple (args) is already a key in the dictionary (d), it simply returns the existing value associated with that key. The function effectively caches the results of calling the provided function (func) with different tuples of values (args) in the dictionary (d), allowing for efficient reuse of previously computed results.
