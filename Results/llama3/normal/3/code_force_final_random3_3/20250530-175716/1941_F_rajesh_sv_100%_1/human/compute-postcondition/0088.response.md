Postcondition: **l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D with respect to f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is equal to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is equal to mid. In both cases, mid is greater than l and less than h, and mid is equal to l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is equal to D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is equal to D[mid + 1] + f.**
