Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, and h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each using the bisect module to find the insertion point for a specific value in the sorted list D. The first line calculates the insertion point for `left - f` in D, and the second line calculates the insertion point for `right - f` in D, then subtracts 1 from the result. The values of `l` and `h` are determined based on the positions where `left - f` and `right - f` would be inserted in D to maintain sorted order. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties.
