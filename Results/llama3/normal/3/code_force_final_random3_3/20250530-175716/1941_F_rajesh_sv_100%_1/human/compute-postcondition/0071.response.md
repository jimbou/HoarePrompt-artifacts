Output State: **l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one, mid is equal to l, mid_sum is equal to D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is equal to D[mid + 1] + f, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, F has at least two more elements, f is the next next element in F.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `h` have been updated based on the results of the `bisect_right` and `bisect_left` functions, respectively. The other variables, including `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `ans`, `F`, and `f`, remain unchanged.
