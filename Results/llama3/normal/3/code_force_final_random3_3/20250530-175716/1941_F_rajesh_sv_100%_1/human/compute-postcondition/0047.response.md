According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `F`. If `F` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `f` is the last element in `F`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `F` must have at least one more element and `f` is the next element in `F`.
State: **l is equal to h, mid is the middle index between l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, F has at least one more element, f is the next element in F**
