Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order, and h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is less than the index of the element before the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one, mid is the middle index between l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f. If the current value of mid_sum minus left is less than the current value of right minus mid_next_sum, then l is now mid + 1. Otherwise, h is now equal to mid.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is equal to mid + 1 which is greater than the index of the element before the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order. Otherwise, l is less than the index of the element before the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, mid is the middle index between l and h, mid_sum is the sum of the middle element in D and f, mid_next_sum is the sum of the next element in D and f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
