Output State: **l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D with respect to f, mid is greater than l and less than h, h is equal to mid, mid is equal to l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is equal to D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is equal to D[mid + 1] + f**

In this output state, the value of h has been updated to be equal to mid. The other variables maintain their previous relationships and values. The value of mid is still greater than l and less than h, but now h is equal to mid. The value of mid is still equal to l + (h - l) // 2, but now h is equal to mid, so mid is equal to l + (mid - l) // 2. The values of mid_sum and mid_next_sum are still equal to D[mid] + f and D[mid + 1] + f, respectively.
