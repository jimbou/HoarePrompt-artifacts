Output State: **l is equal to h, mid is equal to l, mid_sum is equal to D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is equal to D[mid + 1] + f, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, F has at least one more element, f is the next element in F**

The loop continues to execute until l is no longer less than h. At this point, l and h are equal, and mid is also equal to l. The values of mid_sum and mid_next_sum are updated accordingly, and the value of ans is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.
