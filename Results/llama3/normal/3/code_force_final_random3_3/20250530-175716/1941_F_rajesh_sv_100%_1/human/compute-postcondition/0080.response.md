Output State: **l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D with respect to f, such that l is the insertion point for left - f and h is the insertion point for right - f minus one, and l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged as they are used to calculate `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`. The new variables `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are introduced, with `mid` being the average of `l` and `h`, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` being the sums of `D[mid]` and `f`, and `D[mid + 1]` and `f`, respectively.
