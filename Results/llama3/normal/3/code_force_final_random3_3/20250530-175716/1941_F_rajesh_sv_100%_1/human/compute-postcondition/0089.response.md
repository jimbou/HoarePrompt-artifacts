Output State: **l is equal to h, mid is equal to l, mid_sum is equal to D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is equal to D[mid + 1] + f, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the insertion points for left - f and right - f in D to maintain sorted order, l and h, are equal. The mid index is also equal to l, and the sums of D[mid] and f, and D[mid + 1] and f, are updated accordingly. The minimum value of ans is updated based on the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.
