Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, and n is greater than 2. If the difference between the second and third elements of A is greater than the current max_diff, then max_diff is updated to this difference, next_max_diff is updated to the original max_diff, and index is set to 2. Otherwise, if the difference between the second and third elements of A is greater than the current next_max_diff, then next_max_diff is updated to this difference. Otherwise, next_max_diff remains unchanged.***
