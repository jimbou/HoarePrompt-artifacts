The variables in the loop head are l and h, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l and h. If l is less than h, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D with respect to f, such that l is the insertion point for left - f and h is the insertion point for right - f minus one. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of l and h such that l is still less than h.

State: **l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D with respect to f, such that l is the insertion point for left - f and h is the insertion point for right - f minus one, and l is less than h**
