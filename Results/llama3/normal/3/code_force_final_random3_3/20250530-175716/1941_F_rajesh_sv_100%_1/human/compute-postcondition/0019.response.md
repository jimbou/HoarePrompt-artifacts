Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct non-negative integers, `F` is a list of `k` non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `diff` is equal to `A[3] - A[2]`, and `next_max_diff` is equal to `A[3] - A[2]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `i`, and `diff` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `next_max_diff`, which is assigned the same value as `diff`, i.e., `A[3] - A[2]`.
