Output State: **`l` is less than `h`, `h` is the average of `l` and the old `h`, `mid` is the average of `l` and the old `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be the average of `l` and the old `h`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. The values of `l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `h` is still maintained, with `l` being less than `h`.
