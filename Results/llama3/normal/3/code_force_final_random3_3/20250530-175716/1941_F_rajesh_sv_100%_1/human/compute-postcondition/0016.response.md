To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is not explicitly stated, but we know that `n` is greater than 2.

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n`, we can infer that `i` is currently 2 (since it's the end of the previous iteration). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, and n is greater than 3, i is 3**
