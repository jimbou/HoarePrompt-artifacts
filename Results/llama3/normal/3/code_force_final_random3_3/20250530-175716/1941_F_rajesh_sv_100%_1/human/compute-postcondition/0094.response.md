To determine what will be printed when the statement `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` executes, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved.

1. **ans**: The value of `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` for all `f` in `F`. Since `F` is empty, there are no values of `f` to consider, so `ans` remains its initial value. However, without knowing the initial value of `ans`, we can't determine its exact numerical value.

2. **next_max_diff**: The value of `next_max_diff` isn't directly described in the initial state provided. It seems to be related to the maximum difference involving `D[mid + 1]` and `f`, but without explicit information on how `next_max_diff` is calculated or its relation to the given variables, we can't precisely determine its value.

Given the information, we can't calculate an exact numerical value for `max(ans, next_max_diff)` because the initial value of `ans` and the method of calculating `next_max_diff` are not specified.

However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions:

Output: **The maximum value between the minimum of ans's initial value and the maximum differences calculated using D[l], f, left, and right (which remains as ans's initial value due to F being empty), and the next maximum difference (next_max_diff)**
