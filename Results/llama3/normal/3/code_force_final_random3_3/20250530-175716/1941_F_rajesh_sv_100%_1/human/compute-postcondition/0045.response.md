Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `mid` is the middle index between `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, `mid_next_sum` is the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**

In this output state, the values of `l`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged because the given code snippet does not modify these variables. However, the value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of two expressions involving `D[l]`, `f`, `left`, and `right`. This update ensures that `ans` always stores the minimum value it has encountered so far.
