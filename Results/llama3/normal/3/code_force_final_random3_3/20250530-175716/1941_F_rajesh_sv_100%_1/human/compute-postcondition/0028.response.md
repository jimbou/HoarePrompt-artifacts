Postcondition: ***n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of at least 1 non-negative integer, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the element before the maximum difference in A, right is the element after the maximum difference in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in F, l is less than the index of the element before the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one, mid is the middle index between l and h, mid_sum is the sum of D[mid] and f, and mid_next_sum is the sum of D[mid + 1] and f. The current value of mid_sum minus left is less than the current value of right minus mid_next_sum.***
