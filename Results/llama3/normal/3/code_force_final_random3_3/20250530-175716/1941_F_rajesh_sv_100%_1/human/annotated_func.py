#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a function
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns the wrapper function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns a wrapper function, without modifying any input variables or performing any actions, and its sole purpose is to provide this wrapper function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of values of any type and value, d is a dictionary, and func is a function that takes a tuple of values as arguments and returns a value.
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: *args is a tuple of values of any type, d is a dictionary, and func is a function that takes a tuple of values as arguments and returns a value. If args is not a key in d, then d is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is args and the value is the result of calling func with the values in args as arguments. Otherwise, d remains unchanged.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the value associated with the key 'args' in dictionary 'd', which is either the result of calling function 'func' with the values in 'args' as arguments if 'args' was not already a key in 'd', or the existing value associated with 'args' in 'd' if 'args' was already a key.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes in a tuple of values (args), a dictionary (d), and a function (func) as inputs. It checks if the tuple of values (args) is already a key in the dictionary (d). If not, it calls the provided function (func) with the values in the tuple (args) as arguments, stores the result in the dictionary (d) with the tuple (args) as the key, and returns the result. If the tuple (args) is already a key in the dictionary (d), it simply returns the existing value associated with that key. The function effectively caches the results of calling the provided function (func) with different tuples of values (args) in the dictionary (d), allowing for efficient reuse of previously computed results.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that was read from the standard input (stdin), with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_2() returns a string that represents an integer.
    return int(func_2())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_2()

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_2() to an integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are obtained by splitting the string returned by func_2() using the delimiter string and then converting each split part to an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a delimiter string as input, splits a string returned by func_2() into parts using the delimiter, converts each part to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined as the function does not take any parameters.
    return func_2()
    #The program returns the value returned by the function `func_2()`, but the details of this value are unknown since the function `func_2()` is not defined in the given code snippet.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calls another function named `func_2()` and returns its result, without modifying or utilizing any input parameters, as it does not accept any. The exact nature of the returned value is dependent on the implementation of `func_2()`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, and F is a list of k non-negative integers.

    #State: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct non-negative integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct non-negative integers, F is a list of k non-negative integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, and index is the index of the maximum difference in A.

    #State: ans is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f for all f in F, l is equal to h, mid is equal to l, mid_sum is equal to D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is equal to D[mid + 1] + f, F is empty, and f is the last element in F.
    print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
    #This is printed: The maximum value between the minimum of ans's initial value and the maximum differences calculated using D[l], f, left, and right (which remains as ans's initial value due to F being empty), and the next maximum difference (next_max_diff)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list A, and then uses this information to find the minimum maximum difference between elements in A and a sorted list D, considering a list of non-negative integers F. It returns the maximum value between the minimum maximum difference calculated and the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: testcases is a positive integer
    testcases = func_3()
    for _ in range(testcases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: `testcases` is a value returned by `func_3()` that must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations and `func_6()` has been executed for the same number of iterations.

#Overall this is what the function does:Executes a specified number of test cases by calling another function (`func_6`) a certain number of times, where the number of test cases is determined by the return value of another function (`func_3`). The function does not return any value but modifies the program state by executing `func_6` multiple times.
