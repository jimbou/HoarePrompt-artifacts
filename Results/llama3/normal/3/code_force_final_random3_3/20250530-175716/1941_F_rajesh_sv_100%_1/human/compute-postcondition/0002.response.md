Output State: **`testcases` is a value returned by `func_3()` that must be greater than 0 and `func_6()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `testcases` remains unchanged as it was before executing the code. The code only executes the function `func_6()`, but does not modify or update the value of `testcases`. Therefore, `testcases` still holds the value returned by `func_3()` which is greater than 0.
