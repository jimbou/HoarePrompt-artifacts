Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, k is a non-negative integer, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer equal to a[s] * (k+1) + a[s], bp is an integer equal to a[b] * (k+1) + a[b], bm is an integer equal to max(a[b] * (k-1), a[b] * k + a[b]), sm is an integer equal to max(a[s] * (k-1), a[s] * k + a[s])**.

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains greater than 0. The value of `i` remains 0. The value of `k` remains a non-negative integer. The value of `b` is updated to be an integer between 0 and `n-1`, specifically `p[b] - 1`. The value of `s` is also updated to be an integer between 0 and `n-1`, specifically `p[s] - 1`. The list `p` remains a list of integers from 1 to `n`, and the list `a` remains a list of integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `sp` is updated to be an integer equal to `a[s] * (k+1) + a[s]`, which is the result of adding `a[s]` to the previous value of `sp`. Similarly, the value of `bp` is updated to be an integer equal to `a[b] * (k+1) + a[b]`, which is the result of adding `a[b]` to the previous value of `bp`. The value of `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value (`a[b] * (k-1)`) and the new value `a[b] * k + a[b]`. Similarly, the value of `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value (`a[s] * (k-1)`) and the new value `a[s] * k + a[s]`.
