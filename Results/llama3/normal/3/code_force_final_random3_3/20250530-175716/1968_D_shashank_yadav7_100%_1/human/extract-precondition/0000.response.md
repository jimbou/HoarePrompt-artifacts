Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a. The integer k is a non-negative integer and n is a positive integer. 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The permutation p and array a contain integers from 1 to n.**
