Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `b` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `sp` is an integer equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to `a[b]`. If `k` is 0, `bm` is 0, `sm` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `bm` is an integer equal to `a[b] * (k-1)`, `sm` is an integer equal to `a[s] * (k-1)`.***
