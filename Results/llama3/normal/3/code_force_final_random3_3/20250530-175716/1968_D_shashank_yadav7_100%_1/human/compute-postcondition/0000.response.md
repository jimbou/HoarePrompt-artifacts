Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a. The integer k is a non-negative integer and n is a positive integer. 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The permutation p and array a contain integers from 1 to n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case, but the structure of each test case remains the same. Each test case still contains four lines, with the first line containing four space-separated integers, the second line containing n space-separated integers representing the permutation p, and the third line containing n space-separated integers representing the array a. The constraints on the values of n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a are still valid.
