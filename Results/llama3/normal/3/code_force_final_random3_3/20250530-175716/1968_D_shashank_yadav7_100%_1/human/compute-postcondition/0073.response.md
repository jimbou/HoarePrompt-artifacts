Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer decreased by 1, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s] + a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b] + a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of a[b] * (k) and a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b], `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of a[s] * (k+1) and a[s] * k + a[s] + a[s], `i` is 1, `t` is greater than n+1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
