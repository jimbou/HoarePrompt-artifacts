Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a. The integer k is a non-negative integer and n is a positive integer. 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The permutation p and array a contain integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is a non-negative integer less than n, n is a positive integer, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[s] for each iteration, bp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[b] for each iteration, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-i) + bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-i) + sp, k is a non-negative integer decreased by the number of iterations, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If bm is higher than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, k is equal to 0, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer equal to a[s] * n + a[s] * (n-1) + ... + a[s], bp is an integer equal to a[b] * n + a[b] * (n-1) + ... + a[b], bm is an integer equal to max(a[b] * (n-1), a[b] * (n-2) + a[b], ..., a[b] * 0 + a[b] * (n-1) + a[b] * (n-2) + ... + a[b]), sm is an integer equal to max(a[s] * (n-1), a[s] * (n-2) + a[s], ..., a[s] * 0 + a[s] * (n-1) + a[s] * (n-2) + ... + a[s]). If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. If bm is equal to sm, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer equal to 0, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in a, bp is an integer equal to the sum of all elements in a, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of all possible products of elements in a and k, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of all possible products of elements in a and k, i is equal to n, t is greater than n+1. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
