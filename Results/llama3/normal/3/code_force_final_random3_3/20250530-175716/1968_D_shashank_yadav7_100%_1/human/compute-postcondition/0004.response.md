Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `b` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `sp` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `bp` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `bm` is an integer, `sm` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The input in stdin has not been affected by the code.
