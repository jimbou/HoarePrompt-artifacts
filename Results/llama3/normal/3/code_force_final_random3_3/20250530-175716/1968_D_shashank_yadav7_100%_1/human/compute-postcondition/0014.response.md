The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[s], `bp` is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-1) + bp, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-1) + sp, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**
