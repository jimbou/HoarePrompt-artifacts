Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including the number of elements `n`, the number of turns `k`, and the starting positions `b` and `s` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
2.  It correctly adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to make them 0-indexed, which is necessary for accessing the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
3.  The program initializes the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, by multiplying the value at their starting positions by the number of turns `k`. This represents the maximum score they can achieve if they stay at their starting positions for all turns.
4.  The program then simulates the game by iterating through the turns. In each turn, it updates the positions `b` and `s` based on the permutation `p` and updates the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` by considering the maximum possible score they can achieve by moving to the next position or staying at the current position.
5.  After simulating all turns, the program compares the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner of the game. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, it prints "Bodya". If `bm` is less than `sm`, it prints "Sasha". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
