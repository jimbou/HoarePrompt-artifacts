Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer decreased by 1, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to a[b] * (k+1), `sm` is an integer equal to a[s] * (k+1), `i` is 0, `t` is greater than n+1**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, but the values of `bm` and `sm` are now expressed in terms of the new value of `k`.
