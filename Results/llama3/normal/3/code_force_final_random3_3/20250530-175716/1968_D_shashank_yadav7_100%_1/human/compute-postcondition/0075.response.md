The code snippet modifies the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`. The first two lines update the values of `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 from the corresponding elements in the list `p`. The next two lines update the values of `bm` and `sm` by taking the maximum of their current values and the new values calculated using the updated `b` and `s` indices. The last two lines increment the values of `sp` and `bp` by adding the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged.
