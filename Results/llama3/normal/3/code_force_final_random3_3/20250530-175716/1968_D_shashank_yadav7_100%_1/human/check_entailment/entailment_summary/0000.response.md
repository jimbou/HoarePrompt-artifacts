Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game for each test case, updating the positions of 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the permutation p and calculating the maximum possible products. The program also correctly determines the winner of each game based on the maximum products.

However, there are a few potential issues with the program:

1. The program assumes that the input is valid, i.e., the permutation p and the array a are correctly formatted and contain only valid values. If the input is invalid, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.
2. The program uses a simple iterative approach to simulate the game, which may not be efficient for large values of k. A more efficient approach might be to use a recursive function or a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the maximum products.
3. The program does not handle the case where the maximum products are equal, in which case the game is a draw. The program should print "Draw" in this case.

Despite these potential issues, the program is correct and should produce the correct results for valid input.

Correctness: **True**
