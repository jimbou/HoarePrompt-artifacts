Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer decreased by 1, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s] + a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b] + a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of a[b] * (k) and a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b], `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of a[s] * (k+1) and a[s] * k + a[s] + a[s], `i` is 1, `t` is greater than n+1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `k`, which has been decreased by 1. The values of `bm` and `sm` have also been updated accordingly, as they depend on the value of `k`.
