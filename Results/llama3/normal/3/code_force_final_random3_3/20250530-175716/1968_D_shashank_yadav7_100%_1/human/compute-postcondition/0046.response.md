Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `b` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `sp` is an integer equal to `a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] * 2`, `bp` is an integer equal to `a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] * 2`, `bm` is an integer equal to `max(a[b] * (k-3), a[b] * (k-2) + a[b], a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] * (k-1) + a[b])`, `sm` is an integer equal to `max(a[s] * (k-3), a[s] * (k-2) + a[s], a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] * (k-1) + a[s])`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` and `s` are still integers between 0 and `n-1`, `p` and `a` are still lists of integers from 1 to `n`. The values of `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are updated based on the new value of `k`.
