Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[s], `bp` is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-2) + bp, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-2) + sp, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
