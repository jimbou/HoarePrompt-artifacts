The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s] * (k+1) + a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b] * (k+1) + a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to max(a[b] * (k-1), a[b] * k + a[b]), `sm` is an integer equal to max(a[s] * (k-1), a[s] * k + a[s])**
