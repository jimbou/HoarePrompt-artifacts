Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[s], bp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-1) + bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-1) + sp, k is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The code modifies the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`. The new values of `b` and `s` are calculated by subtracting 1 from the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the expressions `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The value of `k` is decreased by 1. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is decreased by 1.
