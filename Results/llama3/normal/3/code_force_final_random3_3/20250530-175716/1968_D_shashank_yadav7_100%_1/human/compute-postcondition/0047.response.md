Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `b` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `sp` is an integer equal to `a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] * 2`, `bp` is an integer equal to `a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] * 2`, `bm` is an integer equal to `max(a[b] * (k-3), a[b] * (k-2) + a[b], a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] * (k-1) + a[b])`, `sm` is an integer equal to `max(a[s] * (k-3), a[s] * (k-2) + a[s], a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] * (k-1) + a[s])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and relationships. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
