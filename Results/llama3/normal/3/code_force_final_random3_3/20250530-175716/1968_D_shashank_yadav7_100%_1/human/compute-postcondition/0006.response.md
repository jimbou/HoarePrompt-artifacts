Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `sp` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `bp` is an integer from 1 to `n`, `bm` is an integer, `sm` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
