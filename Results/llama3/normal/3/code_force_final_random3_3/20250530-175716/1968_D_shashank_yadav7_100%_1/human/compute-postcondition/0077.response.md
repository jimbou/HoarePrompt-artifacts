Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer decreased by 2, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s] + a[s] + a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b] + a[b] + a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of a[b] * (k-1) and a[b] * (k-2) + a[b] + a[b] and a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b], `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of a[s] * (k) and a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] + a[s] and a[s] * (k) + a[s] + a[s] + a[s], `i` is 2, `t` is greater than n+1**

The value of `k` is decreased by 1, making it an integer decreased by 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The maximum values of `bm` and `sm` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`.
