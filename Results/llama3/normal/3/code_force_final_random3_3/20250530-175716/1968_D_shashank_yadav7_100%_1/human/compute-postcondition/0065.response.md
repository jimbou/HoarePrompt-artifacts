According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is greater than or equal to `n+1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to a[b] * k, `sm` is an integer equal to a[s] * k, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than n+1**
