Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `b` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `s` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `sp` is an integer equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is an integer equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is an integer equal to `a[b] * (k-1)`, `sm` is an integer equal to `a[s] * (k-1)`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decreased by 1, and the values of `bm` and `sm` have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
