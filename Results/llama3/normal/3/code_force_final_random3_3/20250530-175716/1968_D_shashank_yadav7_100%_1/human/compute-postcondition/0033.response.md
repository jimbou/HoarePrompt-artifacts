Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer equal to a[s], bp is an integer equal to a[b], bm is an integer equal to a[b] * k, sm is an integer equal to a[s] * k, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` are updated based on the input provided. The variables `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are initialized with new values calculated using the input values. The stdin now contains one less test case.
