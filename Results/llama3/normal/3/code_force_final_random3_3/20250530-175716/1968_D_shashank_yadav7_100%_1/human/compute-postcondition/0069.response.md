Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to a[b] * (k+1), `sm` is an integer equal to a[s] * (k+1), `i` is 0, `t` is greater than n+1. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
