Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, n is a positive integer greater than 2, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[s] and a[s], bp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[b] and a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-1) + bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-1) + sp, k is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The values of `b` and `s` are updated to be one less than the value at their respective indices in list `p`. The values of `sp` and `bp` are increased by the value of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, twice. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the product of `a[b]` and `k` plus `bp`, and the product of `a[s]` and `k` plus `sp` respectively. The value of `k` is decreased by 1. The number of test cases in stdin is decreased by 1.
