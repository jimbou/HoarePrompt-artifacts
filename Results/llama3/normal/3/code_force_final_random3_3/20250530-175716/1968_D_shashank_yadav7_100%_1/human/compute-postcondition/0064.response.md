Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer equal to a[s], bp is an integer equal to a[b], bm is an integer equal to a[b] * k, sm is an integer equal to a[s] * k, i is an integer greater than or equal to n+1, t is greater than n+1**

Explanation: The code first reads four integers from stdin and assigns them to n, k, b, and s. Then it reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to p and a. The values of b and s are decremented by 1. The values of sp, bp, bm, and sm are calculated based on the values of a, b, s, and k. The values of i and t are not modified by the code.
