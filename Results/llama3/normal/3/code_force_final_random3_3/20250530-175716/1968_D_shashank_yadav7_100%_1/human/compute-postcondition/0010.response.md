Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is a positive integer greater than 1, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[s], bp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-1) + bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-1) + sp, k is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of k has been decreased by 1, and the values of bm and sm have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
