Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is a non-negative integer less than n, n is a positive integer, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[s] for each iteration, bp is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[b] for each iteration, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-i) + bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-i) + sp, k is a non-negative integer decreased by the number of iterations, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The current value of bm is higher than the current value of sm, and 'Bodya' is printed**
