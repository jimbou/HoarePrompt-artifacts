Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, b is an integer between 0 and n-1, s is an integer between 0 and n-1, p is a list of integers from 1 to n, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, sp is an integer equal to a[s] + a[s], bp is an integer equal to a[b] + a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of a[b] * (k+1) and a[b] * k + a[b] + a[b], sm is an integer equal to the maximum of a[s] * (k+1) and a[s] * k + a[s] + a[s], i is 0, t is greater than n+1. If k is 0, no changes are made.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The code updates the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`. The new values of `b` and `s` are obtained by subtracting 1 from the corresponding elements in the list `p`. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their previous values and the new values calculated using the updated `b` and `s` indices. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. If `k` is 0, the code does not make any changes.
