Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided problem description. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the duration of the game `k`, and the starting positions of Bodya `b` and Sasha `s`.
3.  It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
4.  The program subtracts 1 from `b` and `s` to adjust for 0-based indexing.
5.  It initializes the scores for Bodya `bp` and Sasha `sp` with the values from the array `a` at their respective starting positions.
6.  It also initializes the maximum scores for Bodya `bm` and Sasha `sm` with the product of their scores and the duration of the game `k`.
7.  The program then enters a loop that continues until `k` becomes 0. In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
8.  It updates the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` by considering the maximum score that can be achieved by staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.
9.  After the loop, it compares the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner of the game. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, it prints "Bodya"; if `bm` is less than `sm`, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided problem description. It accurately updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha, and it correctly determines the winner based on the maximum scores achieved.
