Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to 0, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to a[b], `sm` is an integer equal to a[s], `i` is 0, `t` is greater than n+1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
