Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game between two players, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', based on the maximum possible products of elements in an array and a given integer k. It takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of four lines: the first line contains four space-separated integers (n, k, P_B, P_S), the second line contains a permutation p, the third line contains an array a, and the fourth line is not used. The function then simulates the game for each test case, updating the positions of 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the permutation p and calculating the maximum possible products. Finally, it prints the winner of each game, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' if the maximum products are equal.**
