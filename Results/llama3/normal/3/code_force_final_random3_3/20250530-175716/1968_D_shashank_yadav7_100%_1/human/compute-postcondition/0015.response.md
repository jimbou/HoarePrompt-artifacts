Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[s], `bp` is an integer from 1 to n increased by a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-2) + bp, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-2) + sp, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been decreased by 1, and the values of `bm` and `sm` have been updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before.
