Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer decreased by 2, `b` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `s` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `p` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n, `sp` is an integer equal to a[s] + a[s] + a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to a[b] + a[b] + a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of a[b] * (k-1) and a[b] * (k-2) + a[b] + a[b] and a[b] * (k-1) + a[b] + a[b], `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of a[s] * (k) and a[s] * (k-1) + a[s] + a[s] and a[s] * (k) + a[s] + a[s] + a[s], `i` is 2, `t` is greater than n+1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
