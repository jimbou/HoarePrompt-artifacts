Output State: **`_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, and a function named func_1 has been executed twice.**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, as the code snippet does not consume any input. The function `func_1` has been executed twice, once before the code snippet and once by the code snippet itself.
