Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the original string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the original string `a`, `ans` is -1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `left` is 0, `lsum` is 0, `right` is the number of '1's in the original string `a`, `rsum` is `n`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. No variables have changed values, and the conditions in the initial state are still valid.
