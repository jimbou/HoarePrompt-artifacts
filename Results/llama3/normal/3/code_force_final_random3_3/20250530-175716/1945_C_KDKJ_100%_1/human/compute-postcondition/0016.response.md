Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing three lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, the third list contains two elements, `x` and `y`. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is not '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, otherwise, `x` is 0 and `y` is 2. `stdin` is empty, `s` is the second character in the string `a`, `x` and `y` are returned.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the values of `x` and `y` are now explicitly returned, and they depend on the first two characters of the string `a`.
