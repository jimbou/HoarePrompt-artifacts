Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the position of the road in a village that divides the village into two sides, ensuring that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 reads the input, processes the string to find the integer closest to n/2, and prints this value. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the road that satisfies the given conditions.

func_2 executes func_1 for a specified number of test cases read from standard input. It consumes all test cases from standard input and does not modify the input variables.

Since both functions work together to solve the problem correctly, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
