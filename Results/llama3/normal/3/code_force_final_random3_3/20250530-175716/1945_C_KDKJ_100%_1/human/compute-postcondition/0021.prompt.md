Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is a string of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, S is a list containing a list with two elements, both 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for s in a:
    x, y = S[-1]
    if s == '0':
        x += 1
    else:
        y += 1
    S.append([x, y])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the first character `s` in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing three lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, the third list contains two elements, `x` and `y`. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is not '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, otherwise, `x` is 0 and `y` is 2. `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing four lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', the second and third lists in `S` contain 3 and 0, otherwise, the second and third lists in `S` contain 2 and 1. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is not '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', the second and third lists in `S` contain 2 and 1, otherwise, the second and third lists in `S` contain 1 and 2. The fourth list in `S` contains `x` and `y`, `stdin` is empty, `s` is the second character in the string `a`, the values of the second and third lists in `S` are returned.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
