The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and int(input()), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the int(input()).  If the int(input()) is greater than 0 the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, int(input()) is greater than 0, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the int(input()) is greater than 1 and _ is 1.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, _ is 1, int(input()) must be greater than 1, and a function named func_1 has been executed**
