Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing three lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x+1` and `y`, the third list contains two elements, `x+1` and `y`. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', `x+1` is 3 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x+1` is 2 and `y` is 1. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is not '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', `x+1` is 2 and `y` is 1, otherwise, `x+1` is 1 and `y` is 2. `stdin` is empty, `s` is the second character in the string `a`, `x+1` and `y` are returned.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, and the values of `n`, `a`, `S`, `s`, and `y` remain the same. The list `S` still contains three lists, but the second and third lists now contain `x+1` and `y` instead of `x` and `y`. The conditions for `x+1` and `y` based on the characters in the string `a` are updated accordingly. The standard input `stdin` is still empty, and `s` is still the second character in the string `a`. The updated values of `x+1` and `y` are returned.
