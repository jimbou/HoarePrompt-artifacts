The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If stdin contains at least one more test case the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, and a function named func_1 has been executed twice. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain at least one more test case and `_` is 2.
State: **`_` is 2, stdin contains at least one more test case, and a function named func_1 has been executed twice.**
