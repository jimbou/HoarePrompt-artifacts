Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the original string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the original string `a`, `ans` is -1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `S` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `ans`, which is assigned the value -1. The stdin remains empty.
