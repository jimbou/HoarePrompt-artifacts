Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the original string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the original string `a`, `ans` is either -1 or `i+1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `left` is the number of '0's in the original string `a`, `lsum` is 1, `right` is the number of '1's in the original string `a`, `rsum` is `n - 1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, since the `continue` statement only skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next one, without modifying any variables.
