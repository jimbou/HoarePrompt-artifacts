Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `a`, and `S` remain unchanged. The value of `y` is still dependent on the second character of the string `a`. If the second character is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1.
