Output State: **`_` is 2, stdin contains at least one more test case, and a function named func_1 has been executed three times.**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin still contains at least one more test case, as the code does not affect the input. The function named func_1 has been executed three times, as it was executed twice initially and the code executes it once more.
