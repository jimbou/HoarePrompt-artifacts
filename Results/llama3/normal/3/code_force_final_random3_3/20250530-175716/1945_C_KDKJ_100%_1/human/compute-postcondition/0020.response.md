Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n-1` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing four lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', the second and third lists in `S` contain 3 and 0, otherwise, the second and third lists in `S` contain 2 and 1. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is not '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', the second and third lists in `S` contain 2 and 1, otherwise, the second and third lists in `S` contain 1 and 2. The fourth list in `S` contains `x` and `y`, `stdin` is empty, `s` is the second character in the string `a`, the values of the second and third lists in `S` are returned.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `S` now has four sublists. The first sublist remains the same with two zeros. The second and third sublists depend on the first two characters of the string `a`. If the first character is '0', then the second sublist contains 3 and the third sublist contains 0 if the second character is '0', otherwise, the second sublist contains 2 and the third sublist contains 1. If the first character is not '0', then the second sublist contains 2 and the third sublist contains 1 if the second character is '0', otherwise, the second sublist contains 1 and the third sublist contains 2. A new fourth sublist is added to `S` containing the values `x` and `y`. The string `a`, the integer `n`, and the empty `stdin` remain unchanged. The second character of the string `a` is still stored in the variable `s`, and the values of the second and third lists in `S` are returned.
