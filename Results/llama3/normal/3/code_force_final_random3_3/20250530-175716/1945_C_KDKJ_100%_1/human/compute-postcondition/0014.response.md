Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing three lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, the third list contains two elements, `x` and `y`. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the first character `s` in the string `a` is not '0', then if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, otherwise, `x` is 0 and `y` is 2. `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and `a` remains the same. The list `S` now contains three sublists. The first sublist contains two zeros, the second sublist contains `x` and `y`, and the third sublist also contains `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` depend on the first two characters of the string `a`. If the first character is '0', then if the second character is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x` is 1 and `y` is 1. If the first character is not '0', then if the second character is '0', `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, otherwise, `x` is 0 and `y` is 2. The `stdin` remains empty.
