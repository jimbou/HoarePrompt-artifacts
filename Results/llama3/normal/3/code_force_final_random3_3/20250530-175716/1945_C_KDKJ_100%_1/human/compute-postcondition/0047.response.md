Functionality: **This function reads two inputs from the standard input: an integer n (n >= 3) and a string a of length n consisting only of 0 and 1. It then processes the string to find the integer closest to n/2 and prints this value. The function does not modify the input variables and does not return any value, only printing the result.**
