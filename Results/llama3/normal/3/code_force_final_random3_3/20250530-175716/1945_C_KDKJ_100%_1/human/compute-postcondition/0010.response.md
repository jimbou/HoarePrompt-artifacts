Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing two lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the second list contains two elements, `x` and `y`, where if the second character `s2` in the string `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, otherwise, `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, `x` and `y` are now assigned the values of the last two elements of the second list in `S`, which are `x` and `y` respectively, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and `a` remains the same, the list `S` remains the same, but the values of `x` and `y` are now assigned the values they already had in the second list of `S`. The `stdin` is still empty.
