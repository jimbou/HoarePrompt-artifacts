Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the original string a and y is the number of '1's in the original string a, stdin is empty, left is the number of '0's in the original string a, lsum is 1, right is the number of '1's in the original string a, rsum is n - 1. If the absolute difference between n/2 and i is less than the absolute difference between n/2 and ans, then ans is 1. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged.***
