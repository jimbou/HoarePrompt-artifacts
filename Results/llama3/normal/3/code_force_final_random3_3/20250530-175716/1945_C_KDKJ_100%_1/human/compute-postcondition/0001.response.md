Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, _ is 0, int(input()) must be greater than 0, and a function named func_1 has been executed**.

The code snippet calls a function named `func_1()`, but the function definition is not provided. Therefore, the output state only indicates that the function has been executed, without any changes to the variables or stdin. The initial state conditions are still valid, and the function execution does not affect the values of `_` or the input condition.
