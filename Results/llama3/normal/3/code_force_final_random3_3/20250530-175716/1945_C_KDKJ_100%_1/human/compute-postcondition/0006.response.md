Output State: **_ is int(input()) - 1, stdin contains no more test cases, and a function named func_1 has been executed int(input()) times.**

This output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable `_` has reached the value of `int(input()) - 1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `int(input())` times. The stdin no longer contains any test cases, as they have all been processed by the loop. The function `func_1` has been executed `int(input())` times, as it was called once in each iteration of the loop.
