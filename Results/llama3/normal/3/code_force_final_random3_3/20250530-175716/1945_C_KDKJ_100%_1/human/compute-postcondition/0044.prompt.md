Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the original string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the original string `a`, `ans` is -1, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = i
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - i
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the original string a and y is the number of '1's in the original string a, ans is either -1 or i, stdin is empty, i is 0, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is the number of '1's in the original string a, rsum is n. If left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, left * 2 is greater than or equal to lsum and right * 2 is greater than or equal to rsum. The value of ans is either the original value -1 or the current value of i, whichever is closer to n/2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the original string a and y is the number of '1's in the original string a, stdin is empty, left is the number of '0's in the original string a, lsum is 1, right is the number of '1's in the original string a, rsum is n - 1. If left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n/2 and i is less than the absolute difference between n/2 and ans, then ans is 1. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the original string a and y is the number of '1's in the original string a, left is 0, lsum is 1, right is the number of '1's in the original string a, rsum is n - 1, i is 1, ans is 1. If left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n/2 and i is less than the absolute difference between n/2 and ans, then ans is updated to i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
