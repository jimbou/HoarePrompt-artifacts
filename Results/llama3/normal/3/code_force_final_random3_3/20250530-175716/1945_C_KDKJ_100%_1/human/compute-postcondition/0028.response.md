Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the original string a and y is the number of '1's in the original string a, ans is -1, stdin is empty, i is 0, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is the number of '1's in the original string a, rsum is n. Additionally, left * 2 is greater than or equal to lsum and right * 2 is greater than or equal to rsum. The current value of i is closer to n/2 than the current value of ans.***
