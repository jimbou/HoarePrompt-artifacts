State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists, the first list contains two elements, both 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements, x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the original string a and y is the number of '1's in the original string a, ans is either -1 or i+1, stdin is empty, i is 1, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is the number of '1's in the original string a, rsum is n. If left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, left * 2 is greater than or equal to lsum and right * 2 is greater than or equal to rsum. The value of ans is either the original value -1 or the current value of i+1, whichever is closer to n/2.**
