Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road for each possible position of the road, and it checks if the condition is satisfied for each position. It also correctly finds the position that minimizes the absolute difference between the number of houses on the left and right sides.

The program uses a prefix sum array `S` to efficiently calculate the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road for each position. This allows it to iterate over all possible positions in O(n) time, where n is the number of houses.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the road is laid before the first house or after the last house. In these cases, the number of houses on one side is zero, and the program correctly checks if the condition is satisfied.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
