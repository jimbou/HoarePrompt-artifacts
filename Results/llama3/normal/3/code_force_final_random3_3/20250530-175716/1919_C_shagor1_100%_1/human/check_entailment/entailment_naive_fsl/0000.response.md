Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to split the input array into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that every element of the array is either in `s` or `t`, and then calculates the minimum possible penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

The program uses two variables `la` and `lb` to keep track of the last elements of the two subsequences. It iterates through the input array, and for each element, it checks if it can be appended to either `s` or `t` without increasing the penalty. If it can be appended to either subsequence, it updates the corresponding variable (`la` or `lb`). If it cannot be appended to either subsequence, it increments the penalty counter `ans` and updates both `la` and `lb` to the current element.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input array has only one element, or when all elements are equal. It also correctly handles the case when the input array is already sorted, in which case the penalty is 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
