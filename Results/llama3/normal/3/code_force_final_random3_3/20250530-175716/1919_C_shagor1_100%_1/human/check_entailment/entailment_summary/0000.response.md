Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the input array into two subsequences. The program maintains two variables, `la` and `lb`, to keep track of the last elements in the two subsequences. It iterates through the input array, and for each element, it checks if it can be appended to either of the subsequences without increasing the penalty. If it cannot be appended to either subsequence, it increments the penalty and updates the last elements of the subsequences.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input array has only one element or when all elements are the same. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the size of the input array, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
