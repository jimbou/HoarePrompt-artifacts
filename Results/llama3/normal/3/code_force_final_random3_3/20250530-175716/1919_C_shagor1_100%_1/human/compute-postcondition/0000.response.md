Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).**

The code `pass` does not affect the state of the program, so the output state is the same as the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer n and n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n.
