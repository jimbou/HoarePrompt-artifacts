#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
    pass

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers a_1 to a_n, and processes them accordingly.
