Output State: **stdin contains t integers n, s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive**.

Explanation:

The first line `os.system('cls')` clears the console screen, but it does not affect any variables or the state of the program.

The second line `s = string.ascii_uppercase` assigns the string of all uppercase ASCII letters to the variable `s`. This is a constant value and does not depend on any previous state.

The third line `t = int(input())` reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since stdin initially contains two inputs (an integer `t` and `t` integers `n`), this line consumes the first input, leaving `t` integers `n` in stdin. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, as specified in the precondition.

Note that the value of `s` is not affected by the previous state, and its value is always the same. The value of `t` is updated to the input value, and the state of stdin is updated to contain only the remaining `t` integers `n`.
