Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains t-8 integers, n is an integer from stdin which is at least 4, ans is "AABBCC", x is 3, j is 2**

Explanation:
The first line of code appends two occurrences of the character at index `x` in string `s` to the end of `ans`. Since `x` is 2, the character at index 2 in `s` is 'C', so `ans` becomes "AABBCC". The second line increments `x` by 1, making `x` equal to 3. No other variables are affected by the code.
