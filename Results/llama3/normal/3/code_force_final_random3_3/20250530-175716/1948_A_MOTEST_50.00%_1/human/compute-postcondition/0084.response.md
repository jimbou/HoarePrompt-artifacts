Postcondition: ***`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even and at least 4, `ans` is a string consisting of the first `n//2` uppercase ASCII letters each repeated twice, `x` is `n//2`, `j` is `n//2-1`, stdin contains `t-6-n//2` integers, and 'YES' is printed, and `ans` is printed. If `n` is odd and at least 5, `ans` is 'AAABCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOO', `x` is 14, stdin contains `t-7` integers, `j` is 6, and 'YES' is printed, and `ans` is printed.***
