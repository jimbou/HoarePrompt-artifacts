The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the character at index `x` in string `s` twice to the string `ans`. Since `x` is 1, it appends the second uppercase ASCII letter ('B') twice to `ans`, making `ans` equal to "AA" + "BB" = "AABB". The second line increments `x` by 1, making `x` equal to 2.

Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, i is 2, stdin contains t-7 integers, n is an integer from stdin which is at least 4, ans is "AABB", x is 2, j is 1**
