Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t integers n, s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 integers. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, `ans` is a string consisting of the first `n//2` characters of `s` each repeated twice, `x` is `n//2`, and `j` is `n//2 - 1`. If `n` is odd and at least 3, `ans` is 'AAA' followed by two occurrences of each uppercase ASCII letter from the second to the (`n//2 - 1`)th, `x` is `n//2 - 1 + 1`, `j` is `n//2 - 2`, 'YES' is printed, and the string `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers, `n` is an integer from stdin. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is at least 4, 'YES' is being printed, and the string `ans` is being printed which is 'AAABBBBCD...Z' if `n` is odd otherwise it is the first `n//2` letters of `s` repeated twice if `n` is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even and at least 4, `ans` is a string consisting of the first `n//2` uppercase ASCII letters each repeated twice, `x` is `n//2`, `j` is `n//2-1`, stdin contains `t-6-n//2` integers, and 'YES' is printed, and `ans` is printed. If `n` is odd and at least 5, `ans` is 'AAABCCDDEEFFGGHHIIJJKKLLMMNNOO', `x` is 14, stdin contains `t-7` integers, `j` is 6, and 'YES' is printed, and `ans` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
