The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-4 integers, `n` is an integer from stdin. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is at least 4, 'YES' is being printed, and the string `ans` is being printed which is 'AAABBBBCD...Z' if `n` is odd otherwise it is the first `n//2` letters of `s` repeated twice if `n` is even.**
