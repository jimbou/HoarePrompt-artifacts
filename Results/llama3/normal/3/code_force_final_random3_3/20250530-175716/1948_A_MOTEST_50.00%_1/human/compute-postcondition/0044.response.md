Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-5 integers, `n` is an integer from stdin and is odd, `ans` is 'AAA', `x` is 1**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to 'AAA' and the value of `x` is updated to 1. The stdin now contains t-5 integers because one integer was consumed when `n` was read from stdin.
