Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases. 

1. If n is 1, it prints 'NO' because there is no string with exactly one special character.

2. If n is even, it constructs a string by repeating each character twice, which results in a string with exactly n special characters.

3. If n is odd, it starts with 'AAA' (which has 2 special characters) and then repeats each character twice for the remaining (n-2)/2 characters, resulting in a string with exactly n special characters.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the expected output in each case.
