Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is 0, `i` is `t`, stdin is empty. If any `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If all `n` are at least 2, 'YES' is printed for each `n`, and the string `ans` is printed for each `n`, which is 'AAABBBBCD...Z' if `n` is odd otherwise it is the first `n//2` letters of `s` repeated twice if `n` is even.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the string `s` remains unchanged, the counter `t` is reset to 0, the loop counter `i` is equal to the initial value of `t`, and the input buffer is empty. If any of the input integers `n` is 1, the string 'NO' is printed. If all input integers `n` are at least 2, the string 'YES' is printed for each `n`, followed by the corresponding string `ans`, which is either 'AAABBBBCD...Z' if `n` is odd or the first `n//2` letters of `s` repeated twice if `n` is even.
