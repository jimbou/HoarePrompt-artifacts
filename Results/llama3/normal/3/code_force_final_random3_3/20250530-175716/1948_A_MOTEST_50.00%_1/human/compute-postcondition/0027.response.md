Output: **n is an integer, s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 integers. If n is even, ans is a string consisting of the first n//2 characters of s each repeated twice, x is n//2, and j is n//2 - 1. If n is odd and at least 3, ans is 'AAA' followed by two occurrences of each uppercase ASCII letter from the second to the (n//2 - 1)th, x is n//2 - 1 + 1, j is n//2 - 2, and 'YES' is printed**
