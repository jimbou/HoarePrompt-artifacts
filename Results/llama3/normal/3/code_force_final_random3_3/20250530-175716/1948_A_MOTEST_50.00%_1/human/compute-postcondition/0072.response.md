To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n // 2 - 1` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an odd integer that must be at least 3, `ans` is 'AAA', `x` is 1, stdin contains t-7 integers, `j` is 0**
