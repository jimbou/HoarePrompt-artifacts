Postcondition: ***`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 integers, `n` is an integer from stdin. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is at least 4, 'YES' is being printed, and the string `ans` is being printed which is 'AAABBBBCD...Z' if `n` is odd otherwise it is the first `n//2` letters of `s` repeated twice if `n` is even.***
