Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an odd integer, `ans` is 'AAA', `x` is 1, stdin contains t-7 integers.**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an odd integer, but it is no longer the first input from stdin since one integer has been consumed. The value of `ans` is now 'AAA', and the value of `x` is now 1. The stdin now contains t-7 integers since one integer has been consumed.
