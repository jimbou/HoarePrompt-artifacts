Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 integers**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was input from stdin. The value of `s` remains unchanged as the string of all uppercase ASCII letters. The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 0. The stdin now contains t-1 integers because one integer was consumed to assign the value to `n`.
