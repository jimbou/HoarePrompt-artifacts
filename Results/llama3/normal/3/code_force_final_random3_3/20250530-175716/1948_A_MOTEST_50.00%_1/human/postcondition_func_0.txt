This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers n. For each n, if n is 1, it prints 'NO'. If n is at least 2, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of uppercase ASCII letters. The string is constructed by repeating the first n//2 letters of the alphabet twice if n is even, or by starting with 'AAA' and then repeating the next n//2 - 1 letters of the alphabet twice if n is odd. After processing all integers, the function leaves the standard input empty and the string of all uppercase ASCII letters unchanged.
