You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is n.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
        
    #State: n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], a is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], idx is t*n positions ahead of its original value, results is a list containing t elements: the original result of func_1(n, a), the new result of func_1(n, a), and so on, stdin is empty, _ is t-1
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], `a` is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], `idx` is t*n positions ahead of its original value, `results` is a list containing t results, `result` is the last result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is t-1, and the last result in the list which is `result` is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: `n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], `a` is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], `idx` is t*n positions ahead of its original value, `results` is a list containing t results, `result` is the last result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is t-1, and the last result in the list which is `result` is being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
