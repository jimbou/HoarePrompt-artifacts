Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], a is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], idx is t*n positions ahead of its original value, results is a list containing t elements: the original result of func_1(n, a), the new result of func_1(n, a), and so on, stdin is empty, _ is t-1
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], `a` is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], `idx` is t*n positions ahead of its original value, `results` is a list containing at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is t-1, and the first result in the list which is [result] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], `a` is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], `idx` is t*n positions ahead of its original value, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is t-1, and the second result in the list which is `result` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], `a` is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], `idx` is t*n positions ahead of its original value, `results` is a list containing at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is t-1, and the third result in the list which is `result` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
