Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The function `func_1` takes the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a` as input and returns the minimum number of pairs of cards that can be formed, which is the maximum number of points that can be scored.

The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each card in the list `a`. It then sums up the number of cards that appear twice, which represents the number of pairs that can be formed. The `min` function is used to ensure that the number of pairs does not exceed `n // 2`, which is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.

The program also handles the input and output correctly. The `func_2` function reads the input from the standard input, processes the data, and prints the results.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` is 1 or when there are no pairs of cards. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
