According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results. If the list has at least 1 result the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, idx is t*n positions ahead of its original value. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 result and the result is the first result in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], `a` is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], `idx` is t*n positions ahead of its original value, `results` is a list containing at least 1 result, `result` is the first result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is t-1**
