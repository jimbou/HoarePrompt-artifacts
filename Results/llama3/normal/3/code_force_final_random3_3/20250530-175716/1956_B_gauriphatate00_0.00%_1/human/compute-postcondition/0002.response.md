Output State: **n is a positive integer equal to its original value, a is a list of integers, and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is n, t is greater than 0, idx is n + 1, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(n, a), stdin is empty, _ is 0**

The first line assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to `n`. The second line increments `idx` by 1. The third line assigns a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]` to `a`. The fourth line increments `idx` by `n`. The fifth line appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to `results`. No other variables are affected.
