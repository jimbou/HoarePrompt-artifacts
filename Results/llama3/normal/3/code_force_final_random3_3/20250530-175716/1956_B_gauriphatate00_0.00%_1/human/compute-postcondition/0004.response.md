Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx], a is a list of n integers from data[idx+1:idx+n+1], idx is n + 2 positions ahead of its original value, results is a list containing two elements: the original result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a), stdin is empty, _ is 1**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to the integer value at `data[idx]`. The list `a` is updated to contain `n` integers from `data[idx+1:idx+n+1]`. The index `idx` is incremented by `n` to point to the next position after the `n` integers. The list `results` is appended with the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, in addition to the original result. The state of `stdin` and `_` remains unchanged.
