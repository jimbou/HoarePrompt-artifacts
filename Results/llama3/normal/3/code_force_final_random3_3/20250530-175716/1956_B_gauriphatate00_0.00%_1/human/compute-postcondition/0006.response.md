Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+1], a is a list of n integers from data[idx+2:idx+n+2], idx is n + 1 positions ahead of its original value, results is a list containing three elements: the original result of func_1(n, a), the new result of func_1(n, a), and the new result of func_1(n, a), stdin is empty, _ is 2, t must be greater than 2**

Here's a description of the final output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value at the next position in the `data` list, which is `data[idx+1]`. The list `a` now contains `n` integers from the subsequent positions in the `data` list, starting from `data[idx+2]` and ending at `data[idx+n+2]`. The index `idx` has moved `n + 1` positions ahead of its original value. The `results` list now contains three elements: the original result of `func_1(n, a)`, the new result of `func_1(n, a)`, and another new result of `func_1(n, a)`. The `stdin` remains empty, the value of `_` is still 2, and `t` is still greater than 2.
