Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], `a` is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], `idx` is t*n positions ahead of its original value, `results` is a list containing t results, `result` is the last result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is t-1, and the last result in the list which is `result` is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be the same as the initial state, except that the `results` list will contain `t` results, and the `result` variable will be the last result in the list. The loop will have printed all `t` results in the list.
