Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game by taking turns optimally. The game involves selecting cards from a hand and placing them on a table, with points awarded if a card with the same integer is already on the table.

Function `func_1` calculates the minimum value between the number of pairs of identical elements in a given list and half of a given positive integer. This function is relevant to the problem because it helps determine the maximum number of points a player can score by identifying the pairs of identical elements in their hand.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of integers, and then calls `func_1` with the processed input, storing the results in a list. This function is responsible for handling the input and output of the program.

The program is correct because it uses `func_1` to calculate the maximum number of points a player can score, which is the minimum value between the number of pairs of identical elements in their hand and half of the total number of cards. This calculation is based on the optimal strategy for the game, where a player should prioritize playing cards that have a pair already on the table to maximize their score.

Correctness: **True**
