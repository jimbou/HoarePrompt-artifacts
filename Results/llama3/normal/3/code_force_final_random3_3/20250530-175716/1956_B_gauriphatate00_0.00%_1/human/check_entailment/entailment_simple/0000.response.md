Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The problem statement asks for the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally in a card game. The game involves distributing 2n cards between you and Nene, with each player receiving n cards. The cards have integers from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice.
2.  The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of cards `n` and a list of integers `a` as input. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then calculates the number of pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` and returns the minimum value between this count and half of `n`.
3.  The program then defines a function `func_2` that reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes the input data, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It stores the results in a list `results` and prints each result.
4.  The key insight here is that the optimal strategy for maximizing your score is to play the pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand. This is because playing a pair will guarantee you a point, whereas playing a single integer may not. By playing the pairs first, you can maximize your score.
5.  The program correctly implements this strategy by counting the number of pairs and returning the minimum value between this count and half of `n`. This ensures that you play the maximum number of pairs possible, which maximizes your score.

Correctness: **True**
