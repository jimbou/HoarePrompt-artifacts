The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, and 1 <= `a_i` <= `n` for all `i`, and the length of `a` is `n`, `t` is an integer, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, and 1 <= `a_i` <= `n` for all `i`, and the length of `a` is `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 0**
