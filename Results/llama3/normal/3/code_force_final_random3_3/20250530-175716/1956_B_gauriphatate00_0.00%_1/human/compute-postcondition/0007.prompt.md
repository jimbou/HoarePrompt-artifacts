Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is n, t is an integer, idx is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer equal to its original value, a is a list of integers, and 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is n, t is greater than 0, idx is n + 1, results is a list containing one element which is the result of func_1(n, a), stdin is empty, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx], a is a list of n integers from data[idx+1:idx+n+1], idx is n + 2 positions ahead of its original value, results is a list containing two elements: the original result of func_1(n, a) and the new result of func_1(n, a), stdin is empty, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+1], a is a list of n integers from data[idx+2:idx+n+2], idx is n + 1 positions ahead of its original value, results is a list containing three elements: the original result of func_1(n, a), the new result of func_1(n, a), and the new result of func_1(n, a), stdin is empty, _ is 2, t must be greater than 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
