Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], a is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], idx is t*n positions ahead of its original value, results is a list containing t elements: the original result of func_1(n, a), the new result of func_1(n, a), and so on, stdin is empty, _ is t-1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` will be the value at the index `idx+t-1` in the `data` list. The list `a` will contain `n` integers from the indices `idx+t` to `idx+t+n-1` in the `data` list. The index `idx` will be `t*n` positions ahead of its original value. The list `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the result of the function `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration. The `stdin` will remain empty, and the loop variable `_` will be `t-1`.
