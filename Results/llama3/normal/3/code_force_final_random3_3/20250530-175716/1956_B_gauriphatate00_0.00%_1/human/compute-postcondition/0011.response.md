The only variable in the loop head is variable  result and results, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 2 results the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 1 result, result is the first result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 results and the result is the second result in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx+t-1], `a` is a list of n integers from data[idx+t:idx+t+n-1], `idx` is t*n positions ahead of its original value, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list, `stdin` is empty, `_` is t-1**
