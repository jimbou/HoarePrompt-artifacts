Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by the integer division of the third value in `cnt` by 4, `cnt` is a dictionary with all integers in the original list as keys and their respective counts that must have at least three values, `x` is the third value in `cnt`**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, the value of n remains the same, the list a is still empty, the value of ans is increased by the integer division of the third value in cnt by 4, the dictionary cnt still contains all integers in the original list as keys and their respective counts with at least three values, and the value of x is still the third value in cnt.
