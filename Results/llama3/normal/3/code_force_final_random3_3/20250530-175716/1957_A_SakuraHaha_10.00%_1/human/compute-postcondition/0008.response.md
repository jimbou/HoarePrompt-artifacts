To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `cnt`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `cnt`. If `cnt` has at least one value, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt` is a dictionary with all integers in the original list as keys and their respective counts, and `x` is the last integer in the original list. So for the loop to be executed, `cnt` must have at least one value and `x` is now the first value in `cnt`.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with all integers in the original list as keys and their respective counts that must have at least one value, `x` is the first value in `cnt`**
