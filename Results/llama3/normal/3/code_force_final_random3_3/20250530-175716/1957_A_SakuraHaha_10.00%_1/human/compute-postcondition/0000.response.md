Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary**

The code first reads an integer t from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads an integer n, which is the number of integers in the test case, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The variable ans is initialized to 0 and cnt is initialized as an empty dictionary. After executing the code, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, and cnt is an empty dictionary.
