Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by the integer division of all values in `cnt` by 4, `cnt` is a dictionary with all integers in the original list as keys and their respective counts that must have at least one value, `x` is the last value in `cnt`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `stdin`, `n`, and `a` as in the initial state. The value of `ans` will be increased by the integer division of all values in the `cnt` dictionary by 4. The `cnt` dictionary will remain unchanged, containing all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts. The value of `x` will be the last value in the `cnt` dictionary.
