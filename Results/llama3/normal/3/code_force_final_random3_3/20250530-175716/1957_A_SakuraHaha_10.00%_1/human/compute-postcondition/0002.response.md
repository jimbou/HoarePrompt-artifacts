Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its count is 1, `x` is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the code has updated the `cnt` dictionary by adding the first integer in the list `a` as a key and setting its count to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains t-1 test cases, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is still a list of n integers between 1 and 100, `ans` is still 0, and `x` is still the first integer in the list.
