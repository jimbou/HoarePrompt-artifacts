Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program only considers the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with 4 sides (quadrilaterals), but it does not consider the possibility of forming polygons with more or less than 4 sides.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 1 1

The program will output 0, but the correct answer is 1, because we can form an equilateral triangle with the three sticks of length 1.

The program needs to be modified to consider the possibility of forming polygons with different numbers of sides.
