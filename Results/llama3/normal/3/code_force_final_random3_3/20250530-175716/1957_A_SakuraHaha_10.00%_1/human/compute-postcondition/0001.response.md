To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `x` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. 

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 integer and `x` is the first integer in the list.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 1 integer, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary, x is the first integer in the list**
