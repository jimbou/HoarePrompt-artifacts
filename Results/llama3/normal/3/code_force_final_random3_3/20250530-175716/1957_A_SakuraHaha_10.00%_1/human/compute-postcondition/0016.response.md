The code prints the value of `ans` which is increased by the integer division of all values in `cnt` by 4.
Output: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by the integer division of all values in `cnt` by 4, `cnt` is a dictionary with all integers in the original list as keys and their respective counts that must have at least one value, `x` is the last value in `cnt`, and the value of `ans` is printed**
