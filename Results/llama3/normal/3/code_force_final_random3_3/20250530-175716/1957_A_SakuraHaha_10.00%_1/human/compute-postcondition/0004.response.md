The code `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` updates the count of the second integer `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `cnt` initially has the first integer in the list as a key with a count of 1, and `x` is the second integer in the list, the count of `x` in `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key with a count of 1 and the second integer `x` as a key with a count of 2, `x` is the second integer in the list.**
