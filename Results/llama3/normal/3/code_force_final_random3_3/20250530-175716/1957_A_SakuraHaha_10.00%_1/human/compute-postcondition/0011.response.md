Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is increased by the integer division of the second value in `cnt` by 4, `cnt` is a dictionary with all integers in the original list as keys and their respective counts that must have at least two values, `x` is the second value in `cnt`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the integer division of `x` by 4, where `x` is the second value in the dictionary `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is still an empty list, and `cnt` is still a dictionary with all integers in the original list as keys and their respective counts that must have at least two values.
