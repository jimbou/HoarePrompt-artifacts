Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and a string of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of length n, i is 2, j is 2. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'F', then the i-th and j-th elements of list a are each incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'S', then the i-th and j-th elements of list b are each incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
