Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 2, `j` is n+1. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing the values 1 and 2 and `sb` is a list containing the value 2. If the current value of `b[i]` is greater than 0 and the current value of `a[i]` is 0, then `sb` is a list containing the values 1 and 2 and `sa` is a list containing the value 1. Otherwise, `sa` is a list containing the value 1 and 2 and `sb` is a list containing the value 2.**

In this output state, the value of `sb` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `sa` and `sb` are still dependent on the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, but the value of `sb` has been updated to include the value 2.
