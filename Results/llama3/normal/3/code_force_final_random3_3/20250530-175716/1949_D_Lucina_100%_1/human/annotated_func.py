#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (2 <= n <= 24), the next n inputs are strings of length n. Each character in the strings is either 'F', 'S', '?' or '.'. The i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j. At most floor(n/2) characters in the input strings are 'F' or 'S'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the processed output. It first reads an integer n, followed by n strings of length n. It then analyzes the input strings, identifying indices where the characters are 'F' or 'S', and stores these indices in separate lists. Based on the lengths of these lists, it determines which list to use for further processing. The function then iterates over the input strings, replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in the chosen list. Finally, it prints the modified strings.
