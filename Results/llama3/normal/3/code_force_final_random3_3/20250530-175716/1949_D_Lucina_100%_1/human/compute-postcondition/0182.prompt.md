Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1. `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` also contains the index `i` which is between 1 and n+1 (inclusive). `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The current value of `sa` has a length greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa`, which is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` has reached `n+1`, and `sa` contains all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, as well as any indices `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The length of `sa` is stored in `t`, and `sb` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `x`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'F'
        else:
            nx += 'S'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is n+1, `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` also contains the index `i` which is between 1 and n+1 (inclusive). `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The current value of `sa` has a length greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa`, which is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. `nx` is a string of length n. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to the character at position `j-1` in the string at index `i` of `xx`. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then `nx` is a string containing either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is a string containing 'F' repeated between 1 and n times. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing 'S' repeated between 1 and n times, or 'F' and 'S' repeated between 1 and n times, and nx is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: nx is a string of length n, which is equal to the string at index i in xx if all characters in the string at index i of xx are not '?'. If any character at position j-1 in the string at index i of xx is '?', then if i is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa, the character at that position in nx is 'F'. Otherwise, the character at that position in nx is 'S', and the string nx is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: nx is a string, i is 2, n is at least 1, j is n + 1. If xx[i][j - 1] is not '?', then nx contains the character at xx[i][j - 1]. If xx[i][j - 1] is '?', then if i or j is in the first quarter of sa, nx is 'F', otherwise nx is 'S', and the value of nx is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
