Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and a string of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n` and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains `n-2` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. The current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F'.**
