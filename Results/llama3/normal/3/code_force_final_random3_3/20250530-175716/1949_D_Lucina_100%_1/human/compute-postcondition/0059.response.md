Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, i is 3, j is 2. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'F', then the 3rd and 2nd elements of list a are incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'S', then the 3rd and 2nd elements of list b are incremented by 1.***
