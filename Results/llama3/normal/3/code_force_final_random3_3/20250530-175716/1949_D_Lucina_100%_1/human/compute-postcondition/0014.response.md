Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length `n`, `stdin` contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then the `i-th` and `j-th` elements of list `b` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
