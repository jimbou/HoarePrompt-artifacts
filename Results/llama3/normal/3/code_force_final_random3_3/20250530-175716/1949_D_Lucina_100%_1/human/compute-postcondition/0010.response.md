Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, i is 1, j is 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then the i-th and j-th elements of list a are 1 and the rest are 0. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then the value at index i of list b is incremented by 1 and the value at index j of list b is incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is neither 'F' nor 'S', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
