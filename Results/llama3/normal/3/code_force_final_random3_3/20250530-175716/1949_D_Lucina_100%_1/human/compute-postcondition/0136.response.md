Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` also contains the index `i` which is between 1 and n+1 (inclusive). `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The current value of `sa` has a length greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa`, which is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1. `nx` is an empty string. The character at position `j-1` in the string at index `i` of `xx` is '?'. `i` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` and `j` is not in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`***
