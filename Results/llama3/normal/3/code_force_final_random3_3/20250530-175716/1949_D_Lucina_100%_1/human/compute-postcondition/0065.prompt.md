Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n` and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n` and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'F', then the value at index `i` of list `a` is incremented by 1 and the value at index `j` of list `a` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then the value at index 3 of list `b` is incremented by 1 and the value at index 1 of list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, i is 3, j is 2. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'F', then the 3rd and 2nd elements of list a are incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'S', then the 3rd and 2nd elements of list b are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, i is 3, j is 3. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', the elements at indices 3 and 3 of list a are incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', the i-th and j-th elements of list b are incremented by 1, otherwise list b remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
