You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (2 <= n <= 24), the next n inputs are strings of length n. Each character in the strings is either 'F', 'S', '?' or '.'. The i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j. At most floor(n/2) characters in the input strings are 'F' or 'S'.

For every index k in the range from 1 to n (inclusive), if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'F', then the i-th and k-th elements of list a are incremented by 1.
