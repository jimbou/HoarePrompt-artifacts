The code snippet increments the values of `b[i]` and `b[j]` by 1. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, the values of `b[1]` and `b[3]` are incremented. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is at least 2, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where b[1] and b[3] are incremented by 1, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, i is 1, j is 3**
