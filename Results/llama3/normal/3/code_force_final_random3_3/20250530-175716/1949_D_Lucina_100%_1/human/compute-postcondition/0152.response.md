Output State: **nx is a string of length n, which is equal to the string at index i in xx if all characters in the string at index i of xx are not '?'. If any character at position j-1 in the string at index i of xx is '?', then if i is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa, the character at that position in nx is 'F'. Otherwise, the character at that position in nx is 'S'.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that nx will be a string of length n. If all characters in the string at index i of xx are not '?', then nx will be equal to the string at index i in xx. However, if any character at position j-1 in the string at index i of xx is '?', then the character at that position in nx will be 'F' if i is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa. Otherwise, the character at that position in nx will be 'S'.
