Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0 and also contains all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0 and the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. `nx` is an empty string. The character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?'***
