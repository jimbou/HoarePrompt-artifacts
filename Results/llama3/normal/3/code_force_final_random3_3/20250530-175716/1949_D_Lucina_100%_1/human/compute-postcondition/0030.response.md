Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index 2 is incremented by 1 and the value at index 1 is incremented by 1, xx is a list containing an empty string and a string of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of length n, i is 2, j is 1, and the character at index 0 of string x is 'S'**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `xx`, `x`, `i`, `j`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The only modifications are to the list `b`, where the values at indices 2 and 1 are each incremented by 1.
