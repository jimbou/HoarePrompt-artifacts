The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n` and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 2.**
