Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, i is 1, j is n+1. For every index k in the range from 1 to n (inclusive), if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'F', then the i-th and k-th elements of list a are incremented by 1. If the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', then the i-th and k-th elements of list b are incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), and for each iteration, it checks the character at the current index in string x. If the character is 'F', it increments the corresponding elements in list a by 1. If the character is 'S', it increments the corresponding elements in list b by 1. After the loop finishes, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the variables in the loop head and body, which are updated according to the conditions in the loop.
