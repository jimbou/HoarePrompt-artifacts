Postcondition: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, i is 1, j is 3, sa is a list containing all the indices i where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0. If a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, then sa also contains the index i which is between 1 and n+1 (inclusive). sb is a list containing all the indices i where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0. The current value of sa has a length greater than or equal to the length of sb. t is the length of sa, which is increased by 1 if a[i] is 0 and b[i] is 0, n must be greater than 1. nx is a string of length 1, 2, or 3. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is not '?', then nx is equal to the character at position j-1 in the string at index i of xx. If the character at position j-1 of the string at index i in xx is '?', then nx is a string containing either 'F' or 'S'. If i or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa, then nx is either 'F', 'FF', 'FS', or 'FFS'. Otherwise, nx is either 'S', 'SF', 'SS', 'SFS', 'FSS', or 'SSS'.**
