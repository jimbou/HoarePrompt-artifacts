Output State: **`nx` is a string containing the character at `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

In this output state, the value of `nx` has been updated by appending the character at `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition that the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?' is still valid.
