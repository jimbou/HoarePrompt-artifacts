Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and three strings of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n` and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`.**

The code appends the string `x` to the list `xx`, which now contains an empty string and three strings of length `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
