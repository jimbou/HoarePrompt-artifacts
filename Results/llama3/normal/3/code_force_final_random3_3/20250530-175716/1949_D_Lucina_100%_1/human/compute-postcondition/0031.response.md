Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and a string of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of length n, i is 2, j is 1. If the character at index 0 of string x is 'S', then the value at index 2 of list b is incremented by 1 and the value at index 1 of list b is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
