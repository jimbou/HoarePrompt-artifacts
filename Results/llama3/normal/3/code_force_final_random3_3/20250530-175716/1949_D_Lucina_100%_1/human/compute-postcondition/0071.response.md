The code `sa.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `sa`. Since `i` is 1, the list `sa` now contains the value 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is n+1, `sa` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` is an empty list. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.**
