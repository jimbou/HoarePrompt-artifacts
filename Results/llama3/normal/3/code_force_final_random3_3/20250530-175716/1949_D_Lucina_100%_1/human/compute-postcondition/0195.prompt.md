Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1. `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is n+1. `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `i` is appended to `sb` and the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 2, `j` is n+1. `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `i` is appended to `sb` and the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 3, `j` is n+1. `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0 and also contains the index 3 and the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. Otherwise, `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The state of the variables remains unchanged if `a[i]` is not 0 or `b[i]` is not 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
