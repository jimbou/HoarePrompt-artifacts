According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nx` is an empty string, `i` is 2, and the string `nx` is not being printed, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1, and `j` is now 1.

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1**
