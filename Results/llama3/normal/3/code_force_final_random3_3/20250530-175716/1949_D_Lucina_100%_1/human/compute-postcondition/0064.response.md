Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, i is 3, j is 3. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', the elements at indices 3 and 3 of list a are incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', the i-th and j-th elements of list b are incremented by 1, otherwise list b remains unchanged.***
