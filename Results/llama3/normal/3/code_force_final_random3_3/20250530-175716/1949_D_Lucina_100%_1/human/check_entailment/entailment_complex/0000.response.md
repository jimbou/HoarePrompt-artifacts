Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, processes it, and prints the processed output. It correctly identifies the indices where the characters are 'F' or 'S', and stores these indices in separate lists. It then determines which list to use for further processing based on the lengths of these lists. The program correctly replaces '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in the chosen list, and finally prints the modified strings.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. The use of lists to store the indices of 'F' and 'S' characters, and the use of conditional statements to determine which list to use for further processing, are all correct. The program also correctly handles the replacement of '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in the chosen list.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
