Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 1, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are incremented by 1, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length n, x is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, i is 3, j is 3**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `xx`, `x`, `stdin`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only modification is to the list `b`, where the elements at indices `i` and `j` are incremented by 1.
