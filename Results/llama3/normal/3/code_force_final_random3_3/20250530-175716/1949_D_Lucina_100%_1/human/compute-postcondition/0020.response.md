Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length `n`, `stdin` contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If the character at index `j-1` in string `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` and `a[3]` are incremented by 1. If the character at index `j-1` in string `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` and `b[3]` are incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
