Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then the value at index i of list b is incremented by 1 and the value at index j of list b is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
