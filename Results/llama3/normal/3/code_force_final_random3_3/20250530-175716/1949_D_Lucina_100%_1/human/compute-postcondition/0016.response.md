The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length `n`, `stdin` contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
