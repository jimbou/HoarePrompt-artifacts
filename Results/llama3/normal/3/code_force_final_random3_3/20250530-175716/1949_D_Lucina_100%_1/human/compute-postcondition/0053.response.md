Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n` and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1. If the character at index `j-1` of string `x` is 'S', then the value at index 3 of list `b` is incremented by 1 and the value at index 1 of list `b` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
