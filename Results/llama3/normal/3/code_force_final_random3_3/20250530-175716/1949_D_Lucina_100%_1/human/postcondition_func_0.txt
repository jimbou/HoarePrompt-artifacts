This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the processed output. It first reads an integer n, followed by n strings of length n. It then analyzes the input strings, identifying indices where the characters are 'F' or 'S', and stores these indices in separate lists. Based on the lengths of these lists, it determines which list to use for further processing. The function then iterates over the input strings, replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in the chosen list. Finally, it prints the modified strings.
