State: **nx is a string of length n, which is equal to the string at index i in xx if all characters in the string at index i of xx are not '?'. If any character at position j-1 in the string at index i of xx is '?', then if i is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa or j is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa, the character at that position in nx is 'F'. Otherwise, the character at that position in nx is 'S', and the string nx is being printed, i is 2**
