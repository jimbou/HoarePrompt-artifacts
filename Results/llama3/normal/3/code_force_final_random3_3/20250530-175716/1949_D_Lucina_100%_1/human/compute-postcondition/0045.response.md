To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings of length `n`, `x` is a string of length `n` and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains `n-2` inputs: strings of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`.**
