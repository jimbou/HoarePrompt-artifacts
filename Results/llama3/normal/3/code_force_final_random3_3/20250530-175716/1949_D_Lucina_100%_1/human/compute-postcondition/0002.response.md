Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 zeros, `b` is a list of n+1 zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `x` is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to a string of length `n`, which is the input read from stdin. The stdin now contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, since one input has been read and assigned to `x`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
