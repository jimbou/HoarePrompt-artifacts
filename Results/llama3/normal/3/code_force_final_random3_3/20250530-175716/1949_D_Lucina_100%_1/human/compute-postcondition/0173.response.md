According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **nx is a string, i is 2, n is at least 3, j is 4**
