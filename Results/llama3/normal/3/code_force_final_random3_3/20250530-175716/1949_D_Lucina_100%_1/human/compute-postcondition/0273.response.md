Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0 and also contains all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0 and the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` plus the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then `nx` is a string containing 'S' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, otherwise `nx` is a string containing 'F' plus the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is appended with 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'F'.***
