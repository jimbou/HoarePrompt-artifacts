Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and a string of length n, x is a string of length n, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, i is 1, j is n+1. For every index k in the range from 1 to n (inclusive), if the character at index k-1 of string x is 'F', then the i-th and k-th elements of list a are incremented by 1. If the character at index k-1 of string x is 'S', then the i-th and k-th elements of list b are incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `xx` now contains an additional string `x` of length `n`, in addition to the empty string it initially contained. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
