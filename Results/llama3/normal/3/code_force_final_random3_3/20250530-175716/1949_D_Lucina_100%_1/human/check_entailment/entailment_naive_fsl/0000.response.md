Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it assigns 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transition videos. The program tries to balance the number of 'F's and 'S's by assigning 'F' to the first n//4 - 1 scenarios and 'S' to the rest. However, this approach does not guarantee that the condition of not having more than ceil(3n/4) videos of the same type consecutively will be satisfied.

For example, consider the case where n = 8 and the input is:

.?F????
?.??????
??.?????
???.????
????.????
?????.???
??????.??
???????.?
???????.

The program will assign 'F' to the first 1 scenario and 'S' to the rest. However, this will result in a sequence of 6 'S's in a row, which is more than the allowed ceil(3*8/4) = 6.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
