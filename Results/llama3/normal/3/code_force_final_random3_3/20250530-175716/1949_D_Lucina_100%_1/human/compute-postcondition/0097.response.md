Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 3, `j` is n+1. `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` also contains the index `i` which is 2. `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The current value of `sa` has a length greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa`, which is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` contains the index `i` which is 2. Otherwise, `sa` remains unchanged. `sa` now contains the index `i` which is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `x`, `i`, `j`, `sb`, and `t` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `sa` now contains the index `i` which is 3, in addition to the indices it already contained.
