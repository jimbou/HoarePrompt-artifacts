Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1. `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `sa` will contain all the indices where the value in list `a` is greater than 0 and the corresponding value in list `b` is 0. Similarly, `sb` will contain all the indices where the value in list `b` is greater than 0 and the corresponding value in list `a` is 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `x`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The variables `i` and `j` will be equal to `n+1` after the loop finishes executing.
