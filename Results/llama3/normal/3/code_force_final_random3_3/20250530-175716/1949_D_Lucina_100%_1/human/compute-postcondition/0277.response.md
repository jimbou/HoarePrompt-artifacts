Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is n+1, `j` is n+1, `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0 and also contains all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0 and the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. `nx` is a string of length n. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is appended to `nx`. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then 'S' is appended to `nx` if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, otherwise 'F' is appended to `nx`, and `nx` is printed for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `i` and `j` have reached their final values of `n+1`. The string `nx` has been printed for each iteration of the loop, and its value is determined by the characters in the strings at index `i` in `xx` and the indices `i` and `j` in the lists `sa` and `sb`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
