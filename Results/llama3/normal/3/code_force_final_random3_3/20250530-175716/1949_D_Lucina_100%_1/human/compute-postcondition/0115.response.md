Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` also contains the index `i` which is between 1 and n+1 (inclusive). `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The current value of `sa` has a length greater than or equal to the length of `sb`. `t` is the length of `sa`, which is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1. `nx` is a string of length 2 and is equal to the character at position `j-1` in the string at index `i` of `xx` if it is not '?', otherwise it is 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, otherwise it is 'S' and then 'F' is appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `nx` has been updated by appending 'F' to it. The length of `nx` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
