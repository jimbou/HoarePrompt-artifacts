Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n+1 integers, `b` is a list of n+1 integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and n strings of length n, `x` is a string of length n and is equal to the first input string from stdin, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sa` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0 and also contains all the indices `i` where `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0 and the length of `sa` is less than or equal to the length of `sb`. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string that is equal to the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` and is appended with the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` and then 'S'. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then `nx` is a string containing either 'S' or 'F' and then 'S'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S' and is appended with 'S' at the end and then 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' and is appended with 'F' and then 'S'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `nx` has been appended with the character 'S'. The value of `nx` depends on the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`, and whether `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.
