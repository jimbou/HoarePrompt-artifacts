Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The solution provided checks if either the width (a) or the height (b) of the rectangle is even. If either dimension is even, it prints "Yes", indicating that the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a different rectangle. Otherwise, it prints "No".

This solution is correct because if either dimension is even, the rectangle can be cut into two equal halves, which can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle. On the other hand, if both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two equal halves, and therefore cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Therefore, the solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
