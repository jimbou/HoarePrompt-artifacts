Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin is empty. For each line of input that was read, 'Yes' is printed if either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, otherwise 'No' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0 (since it started between 1 and 10^4 and was decremented by 1 in each iteration), and the standard input (stdin) will be empty because all lines of input have been read. Additionally, for each line of input that was read, the program will have printed 'Yes' if either of the two integers in that line was even, and 'No' otherwise.
