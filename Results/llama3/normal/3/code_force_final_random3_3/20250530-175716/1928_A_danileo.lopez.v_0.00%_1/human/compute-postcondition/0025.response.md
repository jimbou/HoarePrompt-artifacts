Functionality: **This function reads a series of lines from standard input, where the first line contains a single integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers a and b. It then checks each pair of integers to determine if either a or b (or both) is even, printing 'Yes' if so, and 'No' otherwise. The function processes all input lines and prints a corresponding output for each pair of integers, leaving the standard input empty after execution.**
