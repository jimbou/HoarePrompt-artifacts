Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if either the width (a) or the height (b) of the rectangle is even. If either of them is even, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and then these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle with different dimensions. This is because an even number can be divided by 2, allowing for a cut to be made parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle.

The program correctly handles the case where both a and b are odd, in which case it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

The program also correctly handles the case where a and b are equal, in which case it prints 'Yes' if a (or b) is even, and 'No' if a (or b) is odd.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
