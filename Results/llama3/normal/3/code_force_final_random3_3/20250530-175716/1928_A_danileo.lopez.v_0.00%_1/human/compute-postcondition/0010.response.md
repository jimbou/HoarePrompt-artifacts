The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-1, `a` and `b` are integers, stdin contains at least `t` lines of input, each containing two integers. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, 'Yes' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.**
