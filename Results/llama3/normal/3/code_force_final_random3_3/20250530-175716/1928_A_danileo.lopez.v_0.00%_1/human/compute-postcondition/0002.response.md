Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers, stdin contains at least `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers from the first line of input. The stdin now contains at least `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
