The code `t = int(input())` reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains a single integer t, and assigns it to the variable t. The value of t is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The remaining lines of input in stdin are still present, each containing two integers a and b.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two integers a and b**
