Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4-1, `a` and `b` are integers that were read from the second line of input, stdin contains at least `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers. 'Yes' is printed if either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, otherwise 'No' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers read from the second line of input, and the number of lines in stdin has decreased by one. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the condition for printing 'Yes' or 'No' still depends on the parity of `a` and `b`.
