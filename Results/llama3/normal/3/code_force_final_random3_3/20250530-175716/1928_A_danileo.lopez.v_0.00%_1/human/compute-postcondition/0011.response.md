Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4-1, `a` and `b` are integers that were read from the first line of input, stdin contains at least `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, 'Yes' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two integers read from the first line of input. The value of `t` remains the same, and the stdin now contains at least `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers. The condition for printing 'Yes' or 'No' is still dependent on the values of `a` and `b`.
