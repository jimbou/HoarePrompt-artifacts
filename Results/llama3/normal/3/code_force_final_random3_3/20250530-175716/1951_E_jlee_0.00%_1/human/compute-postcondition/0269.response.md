Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1, `count` is 1, If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `count` which is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
