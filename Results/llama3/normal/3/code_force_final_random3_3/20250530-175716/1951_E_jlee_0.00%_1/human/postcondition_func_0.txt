This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and each of the following t lines contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). It then checks each string to determine if it can be split into two substrings that are the same when reversed. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES', the number of splits required (1 or 2), and the resulting substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all input strings and prints the results for each one.
