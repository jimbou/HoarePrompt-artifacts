Postcondition: **`count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is True.**
