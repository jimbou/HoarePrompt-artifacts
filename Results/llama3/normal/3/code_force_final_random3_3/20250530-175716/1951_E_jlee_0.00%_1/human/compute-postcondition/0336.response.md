Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 3, j is 2. If count is greater than 1, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the string with the first character and the rest of the string, and sets done to True. If count is not greater than 1, the program sets count2 to 0 and done to False, without printing any output. If count2 is greater than count, then done is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
