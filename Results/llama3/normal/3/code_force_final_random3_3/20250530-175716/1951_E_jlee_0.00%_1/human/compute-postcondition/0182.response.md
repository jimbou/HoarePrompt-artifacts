Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, count is either 0 or 1 or 2, count2 is either 0 or 1 or 2, done is False, n is the length of the string s. If n is equal to 1, 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.***
