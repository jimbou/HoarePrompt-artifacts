Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`***
