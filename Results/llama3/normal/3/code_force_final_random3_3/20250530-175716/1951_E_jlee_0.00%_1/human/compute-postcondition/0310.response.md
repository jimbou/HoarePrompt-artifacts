Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 3, j is 2, count is 2. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is set to True.**

In this output state, the value of count is updated to 2, which is the current value of j. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions and relationships between them are still valid.
