The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. The values of the variables do not change but we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, count is either 0 or 1 or 2, count2 is either 0 or 1 or 2, done is False, n is the length of the string s, and 'NO' is being printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only.
