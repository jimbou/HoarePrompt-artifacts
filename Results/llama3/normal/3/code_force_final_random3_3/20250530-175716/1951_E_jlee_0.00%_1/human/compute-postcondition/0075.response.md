Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, if count > 1, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first j-1 characters of the string and the rest of the string starting from the jth character are printed. Otherwise, if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False, x is the first character of s, n must be greater than 0, j is 0, and count2 is 0.***
