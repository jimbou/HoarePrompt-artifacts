Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `j` is 2, `n` is unknown but (n + 1) // 2 is greater than 2, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, `done` is True. If `count` > 1, then `done` is True. If `count2` >= `count`, then `count2` is 0, `count` is 2, `done` is True, 'YES' has been printed, the number 1 has been printed, and the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6) has been printed. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is increased by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' is being printed, the number 1 is being printed, and the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6) is being printed.**
