The code prints two substrings of the string `string`. The first substring `string[:j]` includes all characters from the start of the string up to, but not including, the character at index `j`. The second substring `string[j:]` includes all characters from index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `j` is 0, the first substring `string[:j]` is an empty string, and the second substring `string[j:]` is the entire string `string`.

Output: **an empty string, the entire string string**
