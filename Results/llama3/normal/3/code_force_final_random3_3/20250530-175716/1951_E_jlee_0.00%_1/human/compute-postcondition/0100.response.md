Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, j is 1, n is unknown but (n + 1) // 2 is greater than 1. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True.***
