Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, done is False, x is the first character of s. If the first character of s is not equal to the last character of s, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, the string is printed, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
