Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, the current value of count is greater than 0, count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 0, j is 0. The current value of count is greater than 0, indicating that s[j] is not equal to x and count was less than 1 at some point. The character at the jth index of s is not equal to the character at the (n-1-j)th index of s, so done is True, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first j characters of string and the rest of the string are printed**
