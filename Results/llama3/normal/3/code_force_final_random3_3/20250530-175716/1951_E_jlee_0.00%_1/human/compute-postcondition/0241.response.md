Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, count is 1, count2 is 0, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 0, j is 0. The current value of count is 1, indicating that s[j] is not equal to x and count was less than 1 at some point. The character at the jth index of s is not equal to the character at the (n-1-j)th index of s, so done is True. Additionally, either count2 is less than or equal to 0 or count2 is greater than or equal to count. The current value of count2 is equal to the current value of count.**
