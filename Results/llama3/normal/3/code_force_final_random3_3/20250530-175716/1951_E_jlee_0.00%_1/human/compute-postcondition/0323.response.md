Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
* `j` is an integer with a value of 2.
* The print statement uses slicing to extract two parts of the `string`:
	+ `string[:j - 1]` extracts the substring from the beginning of `string` up to, but not including, the character at index `j - 1`, which is equivalent to `string[:1]`. This will extract the first character of `string`.
	+ `string[j - 1:]` extracts the substring from the character at index `j - 1` (which is the second character of `string`) to the end of `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string, starting from the second character.

Output: **the first character of the string, followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character**
