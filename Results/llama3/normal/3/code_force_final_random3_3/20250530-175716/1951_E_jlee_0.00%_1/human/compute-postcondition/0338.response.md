Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 3, j is 2, count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is set to 2. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is set to True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the value of count2 has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
