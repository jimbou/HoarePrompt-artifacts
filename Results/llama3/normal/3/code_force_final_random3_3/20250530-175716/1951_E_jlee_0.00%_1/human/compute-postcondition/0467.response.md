Postcondition: **`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 1, `done` is a boolean. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `done` is True. If `count` is larger than 1, then `done` is True. If `count` is 1, then `count2` is 0 and `done` is True. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 1, and if `s[1]` is not equal to `s[n - 2]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' was printed, 1 was printed, and `s` was printed. Otherwise, no changes were made.**
