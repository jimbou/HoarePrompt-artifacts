Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 3, j is 2. If s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 > 0 and count2 < count, done is True. Otherwise, if count is greater than 1, 'YES', the number 2, and the string with the first character and the rest of the string are printed, and done is set to True. If count is not greater than 1, count2 is set to 0 and done to False, without printing any output. If count2 is greater than count, then done is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made. If s[j] is equal to x, count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is set to 2. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is set to True.***
