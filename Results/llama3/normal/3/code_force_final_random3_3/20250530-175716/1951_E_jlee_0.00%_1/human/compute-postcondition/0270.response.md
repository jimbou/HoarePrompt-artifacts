Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 1, j is 1. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is 1 and if s[j] is not equal to s[n-1-j], then done is True. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
