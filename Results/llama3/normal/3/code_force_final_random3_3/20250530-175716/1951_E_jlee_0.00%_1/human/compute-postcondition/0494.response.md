Output: **`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 2, `done` is a boolean. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, no changes were made. `n` is greater than or equal to 3, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and the string `s` is split into two parts at index `j - 1` (which is 1) and printed**
