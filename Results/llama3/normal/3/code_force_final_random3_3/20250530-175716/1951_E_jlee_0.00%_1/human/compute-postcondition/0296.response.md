Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 1, j is 1. If count2 is equal to count, then done is True if count is greater than 1 or if count is less than or equal to 1 and s[j] is not equal to x and s[j] is not equal to s[n-1-j]. If count2 is not equal to count, then done is True, count is 1, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first j characters of the string which is string[:j] are printed, and the rest of the string which is string[j:] are printed.***
