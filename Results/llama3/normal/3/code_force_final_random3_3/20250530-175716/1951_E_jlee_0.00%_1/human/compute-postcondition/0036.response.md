Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, done is False, x is the first character of s. The first character of s is equal to the last character of s, the count of x in s is equal to n - 1. If n is odd and the middle character of s is not equal to x, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and string is printed. We skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the string `s` and its characters are still valid. The program will move on to the next iteration of the loop, if any.
