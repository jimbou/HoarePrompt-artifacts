Postcondition: ***`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 2, `done` is a boolean. If `count` > 0, then the following changes are made: if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count` is 2 and `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string `s` is split into two parts at index 1 and printed, and `done` is True. Otherwise, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0, and no changes were made to `n`, `s`, `j`, or `done`. If `count2` is less than `count`, then `count` is 2, `count2` is an integer, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string, `j` is 2, and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is increased by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, then no changes were made to `count`, `count2`, `n`, `s`, `j`, or `done`.***
