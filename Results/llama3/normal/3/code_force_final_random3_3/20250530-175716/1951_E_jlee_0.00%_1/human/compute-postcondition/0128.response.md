Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `j` is 1, `n` is unknown but (n + 1) // 2 is greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, `count` is either 0 or 1, and `count2` is 0.***
