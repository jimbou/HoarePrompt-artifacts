Postcondition: ***`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 2, `done` is a boolean. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count` is 2, `done` is True. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, no changes were made. `n` is greater than or equal to 3.***
