Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, count is greater than 0, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 0, j is 0, done is True. If count2 is greater than count, then count2 is greater than count. Otherwise, count2 is less than or equal to count.***
