Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, done is True, x is the first character of s, n must be greater than 0, j is 0, count is greater than 0, count2 is greater than count.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The value of `i` remains 0. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). The `string` variable remains unchanged, still a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). The `s` variable remains a list of characters. The `done` variable is now True. The `x` variable remains the first character of `s`. The `n` variable remains greater than 0. The `j` variable remains 0. The `count` variable remains greater than 0. The `count2` variable remains greater than `count`.
