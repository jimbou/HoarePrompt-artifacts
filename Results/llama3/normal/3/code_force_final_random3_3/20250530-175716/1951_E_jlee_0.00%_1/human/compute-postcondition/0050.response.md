Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False, x is the first character of s, count is 0, count2 is 0, n must be greater than 0, j is 0. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x and the current value of count is less than 1***
