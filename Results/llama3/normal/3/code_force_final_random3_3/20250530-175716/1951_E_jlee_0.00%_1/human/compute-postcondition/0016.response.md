Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, and the current value of `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.
