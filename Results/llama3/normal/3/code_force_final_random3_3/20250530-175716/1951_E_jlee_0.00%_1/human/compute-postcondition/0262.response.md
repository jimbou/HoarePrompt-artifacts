Output: ** `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 1, `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first `j` characters of `string` and the rest of the string are printed. If `count2` is not greater than 0 and less than `count`, then if `count2` is equal to `count`, `count` is either greater than 1 or equal to 1, otherwise `count2` is either greater than `count` or less than or equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `done` is False, `count2` is 1, and the character at the `jth` index of `s` is equal to the character at the `(n-1-j)th` index of `s`. If `count` is not greater than 0, then no action is taken, and 'YES' is printed**
