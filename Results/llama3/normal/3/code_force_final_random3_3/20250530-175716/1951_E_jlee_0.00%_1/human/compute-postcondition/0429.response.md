Postcondition: **`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 0, `done` is a boolean. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and `done` is True. If `count2` is not greater than 0 and less than `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `count2` is equal to `count`, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and `done` is True. If `count` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1, then `count2` is 0, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, if the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j` which is 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is True. Either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 1, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j` which is 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is True. Additionally, the current value of `s[j]` is equal to `x`.**
