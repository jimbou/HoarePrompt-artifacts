Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` remains False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count2` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0. The value of `i` is still 0. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The value of `string` is still a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The value of `s` is still a list of characters. The value of `done` is still dependent on whether `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. The value of `x` is still the first character of `s`. The value of `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `j` is still 0. The value of `count` is still greater than 0.
