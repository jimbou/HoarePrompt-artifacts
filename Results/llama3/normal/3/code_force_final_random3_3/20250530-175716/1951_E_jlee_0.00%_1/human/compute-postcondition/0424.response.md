Postcondition: ***`count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, if the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j` which is 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is True. Either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. `count2` is not equal to `count`.***
