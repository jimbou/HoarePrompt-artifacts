Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, done is False, x is the first character of s. The first character of s is equal to the last character of s, 'YES' is not printed, 1 is not printed, the string is not printed, and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is executed. The count of x in s is equal to n - 1. Either n is even or s[(n - 1) // 2] is equal to x, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed**
