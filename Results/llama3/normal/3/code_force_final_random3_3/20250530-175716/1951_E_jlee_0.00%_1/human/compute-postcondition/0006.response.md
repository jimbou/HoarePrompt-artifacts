Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, the current value of n is 1, done is False, and 'NO' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the continue statement. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, and the other variables retain their initial values.
