Postcondition: **The program continues to execute if the count of the first character of `s` is not equal to `n` and the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`. If the count of the first character of `s` is equal to `n`, then 'NO' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If the count of the first character of `s` is equal to `n - 1`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
