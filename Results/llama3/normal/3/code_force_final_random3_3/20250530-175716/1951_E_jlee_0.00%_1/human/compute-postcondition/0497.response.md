Postcondition: ***`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 2, `done` is a boolean. If `count` is greater than 1, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string `s` is split into two parts at index 1 and printed, and `done` is True. Otherwise, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0, and no changes were made to `n`, `s`, `j`, or `done`.***
