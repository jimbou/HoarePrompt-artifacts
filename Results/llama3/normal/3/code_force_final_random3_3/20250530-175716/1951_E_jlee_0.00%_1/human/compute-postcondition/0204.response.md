Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, count is either 0 or 1 or 2, count2 is either 0 or 1 or 2, done is False, n is the length of the string s. If n is odd and the middle character of s is not equal to x, 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed, the number 1 is being printed, and the string is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
