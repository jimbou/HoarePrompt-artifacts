Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, done is False, x is the first character of s.**

In this output state, the value of x has been updated to be the first character of the string s. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. The string and s are still lists of characters, and done is still False.
