Postcondition: ***`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 1, `done` is a boolean. If `count` is larger than 1, then `count` is an integer, `count2` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `j` is 1, `done` is True. If `count` is 1, then `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, `j` is 1, `done` is True.***
