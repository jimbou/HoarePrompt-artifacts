The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than (n + 1) // 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0, n is unknown but (n + 1) // 2 is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again j must be increased by 1 and (n + 1) // 2 must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, j is 1, n is unknown but (n + 1) // 2 is greater than 1**
