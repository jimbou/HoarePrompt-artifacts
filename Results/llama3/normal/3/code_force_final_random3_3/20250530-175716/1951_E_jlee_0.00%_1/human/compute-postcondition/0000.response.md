The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that the first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4).

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input. The remaining input lines, which contain strings `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters, are still present in the standard input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6).**
