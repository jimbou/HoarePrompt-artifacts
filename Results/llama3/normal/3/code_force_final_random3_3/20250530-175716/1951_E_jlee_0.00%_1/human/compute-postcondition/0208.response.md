To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because `(n + 1) // 2` will be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, `n` is the length of the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed `n` must be greater than 0 and `j` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, `n` is the length of the string `s` and must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
