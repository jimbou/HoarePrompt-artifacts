Based on the precondition, the code `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])` will print two parts of the string `s`.

Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` will print an empty string because it's trying to print from the beginning of the string up to, but not including, the 0th character.

`string[j - 1:]` will print the entire string `s` because it's printing from the 0th character (since `j - 1` is 0) to the end of the string.

So, the output will be an empty string followed by the entire string `s`.

Output: **[empty string], [the entire string s]**
