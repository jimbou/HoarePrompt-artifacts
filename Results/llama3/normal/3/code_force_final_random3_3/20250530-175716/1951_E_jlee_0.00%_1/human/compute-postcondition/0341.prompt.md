Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, count is 0, count2 is 0, done is False, n is the length of the string s.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 0, j is 0. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, done is True. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first j characters of string and the rest of the string are printed. If count2 is not greater than 0 and less than count, then if count2 is equal to count, count is either greater than 1 or equal to 1, otherwise count2 is either greater than count or less than or equal to count. If s[j] is equal to x, then done is False, count2 is 1, and the character at the jth index of s is equal to the character at the (n-1-j)th index of s. If count is not greater than 0, then no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 1, j is 1. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, done is True if count is greater than 1 or if count is less than or equal to 1 and s[j] is not equal to s[n-1-j]. If count2 is greater than 0 and count2 is less than count, then done is True, count is 1, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first j characters of the string are printed and the rest of the string from index j to the end is printed. If count2 is not greater than 0 or count2 is not less than count, then count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is equal to x, then count is 1 and if s[j] is not equal to s[n-1-j], then done is True. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 1, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters, x is the first character of s, n is the length of the string s and must be greater than 3, j is 2. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, if count2 > 0 and count2 < count, done is True. Otherwise, if count is greater than 1, 'YES', the number 2, and the string with the first character and the rest of the string are printed, and done is set to True. If count is not greater than 1, count2 is set to 0 and done to False, without printing any output. If count2 is greater than count, then done is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made. If s[j] is equal to x, count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is set to 2. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is set to True. If count is not greater than 0, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
