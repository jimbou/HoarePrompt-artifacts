Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters. If count > 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, the program checks the value of count2 and performs different actions based on its value. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. If count2 equals count, then if count > 1, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first j-1 characters of the string and the rest of the string starting from the jth character are printed, and done is True. If count2 is not equal to count and count2 is greater than count, done is True. If count2 is not equal to count and count2 is less than count, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If count is not greater than 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
