Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 2, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `j` is 2, `n` is unknown but (n + 1) // 2 is greater than 2, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' is being printed, the number 1 is being printed, and the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6) is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `j`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for printing 'YES', the number 1, and the string, as well as the value of `done`, are still dependent on the comparison of `s[j]` and `s[n - 1 - j]`.
