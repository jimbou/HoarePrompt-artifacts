To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0. Additionally, since `i` is the loop counter, it should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6)**
