Postcondition: ***`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 0, `done` is a boolean. If `count` is greater than 1, then `count2` is equal to `count`, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and `done` is True. If `count` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1, then `count2` is 0, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0.***
