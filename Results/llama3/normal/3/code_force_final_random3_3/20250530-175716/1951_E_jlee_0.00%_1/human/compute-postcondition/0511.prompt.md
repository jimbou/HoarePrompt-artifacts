Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The program continues to execute with the same conditions as before, but with two new variables `count` and `count2` initialized to 0. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 0, `done` is a boolean. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and `done` is True. If `count2` is not greater than 0 and less than `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, `count2` is equal to `count`, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and `done` is True. If `count` is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1, then `count2` is 0, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Additionally, if the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j` which is 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is True. Either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 1, `s` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j` which is 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is less than 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and done is True. Additionally, the current value of `s[j]` is equal to `x`. If `count` is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 1, `done` is a boolean. If `count` is larger than 0, then `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is increased by 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `done` is True. If `count` is larger than 1, then `done` is True. If `count` is 1, then `count2` is 0 and `done` is True. If `count` is 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 1, and if `s[1]` is not equal to `s[n - 2]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' was printed, 1 was printed, and `s` was printed. Otherwise, no changes were made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`count`, `count2`, `n` are integers, `s` is a string, `j` is 2, `done` is a boolean. If `count` > 0, then the following changes are made: if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count` is 2 and `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string `s` is split into two parts at index 1 and printed, and `done` is True. Otherwise, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0, and no changes were made to `n`, `s`, `j`, or `done`. If `count2` is less than `count`, then `count` is 2, `count2` is an integer, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a string, `j` is 2, and `done` is True. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is increased by 1. If `count` is not greater than 0, then no changes were made to `count`, `count2`, `n`, `s`, `j`, or `done`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
