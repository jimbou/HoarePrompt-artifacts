Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `j` is 1, so `string[:j]` will print the substring of `string` from index 0 to 1, which is the first character of the string.
* `string[j:]` will print the substring of `string` from index 1 to the end of the string.

Since the exact value of `string` is not provided, we can't determine the exact characters that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **the first character of the string s, the substring of s from the second character to the end**
