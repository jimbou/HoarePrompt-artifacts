Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |string| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters, `j` is 1, `n` is unknown but (n + 1) // 2 is greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is set to 1. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then done is True. Otherwise, if count is greater than 1 or count2 is greater than or equal to count, then done is True. Otherwise, count is either 0 or 1, and count2 is 0. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then done is True. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If count is greater than 0, then done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
