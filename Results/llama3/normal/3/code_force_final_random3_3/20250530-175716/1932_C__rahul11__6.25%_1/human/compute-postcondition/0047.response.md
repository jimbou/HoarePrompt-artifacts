Output State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all integers in the list modulo `m` modulo MOD, `ans` is the product of all integers in the list divided by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo MOD, MOD is 1000000006, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is 2, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `ans` is divided by `arr[l]`. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is divided by `arr[r]`.**

The value of `c` is incremented by 1, resulting in `c` being 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
