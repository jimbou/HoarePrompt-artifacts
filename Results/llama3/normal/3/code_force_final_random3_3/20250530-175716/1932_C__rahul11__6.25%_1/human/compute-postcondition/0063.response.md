To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element. Since `i` is the last integer in the list, for the loop to start, `i` should be the first element in the list `arr`. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of n integers, `ans` is 1, `MOD` is 1000000006, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 1, `i` is the first integer in the list `arr`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `n`, `r` is 0, `k` is `n - 1`, and the elements of the list `res` are being printed**
