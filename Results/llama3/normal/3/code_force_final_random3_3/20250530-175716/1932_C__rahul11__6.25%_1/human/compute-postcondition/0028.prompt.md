Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in the list arr modulo m modulo MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is the product of all elements in the list arr, _ is 0, stdin is empty, t is at least 0, i is the last element in the list, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all elements in the list `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD` and the rest are zeros, `ans` is the product of all elements in the list `arr` divided by either `arr[l-1]` or the last element of `arr` modulo `MOD`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `c` is 2, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0. The value of `s[k]` is either 'L' or not equal to 'L'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all elements in the list `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', the second element of `res` is the product of all elements in the list `arr` divided by `arr[l-1]` modulo `MOD` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, and the rest are zeros. If `s[k]` is not 'L', the third element of `res` is the product of all elements in the list `arr` divided by the last element of `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`, and the rest are zeros except the first one. `ans` is the product of all elements in the list `arr` divided by either `arr[l]` or the last element of `arr` modulo `MOD`. `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 0, `i` is the last element in the list, `c` is 3, `l` is either 0, 1, or 2, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, and `k` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is at least 3, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in the list arr modulo m modulo MOD. If s[k] is 'L', the second element of res is the product of all elements in the list arr divided by arr[l-1] modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros. If s[k] is not 'L', the third element of res is the product of all elements in the list arr divided by the last element of arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros except the first one. ans is the product of all elements in the list arr divided by either arr[l] or the last element of arr modulo MOD. If s[k] is 'L', ans is not divided by arr[r] modulo MOD. If s[k] is not 'L', ans is divided by arr[r] modulo MOD. _ is 0, stdin is empty, t is at least 0, i is the last element in the list, c is 4, l is either 0, 1, or 2, r is either n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, and k is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
