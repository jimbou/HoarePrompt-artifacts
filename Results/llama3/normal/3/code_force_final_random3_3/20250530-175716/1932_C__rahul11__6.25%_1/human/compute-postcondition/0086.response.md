Postcondition: ***n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, the third element is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index l or r in arr modulo m modulo MOD, depending on whether the character at index k of the list s is 'L' or not, and the fourth element is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index l or r in arr modulo m modulo MOD, depending on whether the character at index k of the list s is 'L' or not, c is 3, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 0, l is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character at index k of the list s is 'L' or not, r is either n - 1 or n - 2 depending on whether the character at index k of the list s is 'L' or not, k is 2, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index l or r in arr modulo MOD, depending on whether the character at index k of the list s is 'L' or not, and stdin is empty.***
