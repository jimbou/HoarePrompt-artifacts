Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of n integers, `ans` is `i` times the second integer in the list `arr`, `MOD` is 1000000006, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 1, `i` is the second integer in the list `arr`, `c` is `n`, `l` is `n`, `r` is 0, `k` is `n - 1`, and the elements of the list `res` are being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of its original value (`i`) and the second integer in the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
