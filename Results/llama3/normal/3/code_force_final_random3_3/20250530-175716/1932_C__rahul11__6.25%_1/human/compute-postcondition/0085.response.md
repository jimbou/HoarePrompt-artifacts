Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, the third element is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the fourth element is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo m modulo MOD, c is 3, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 0, stdin is empty, l is 0, r is n - 2, k is 2, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, and ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo MOD.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integer at index `r` in `arr` modulo MOD. The value of `res[c]` has been updated to be the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integer at index `r` in `arr` modulo `m` modulo MOD. The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
