Postcondition: ***n is an integer that is at least 3, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in the list modulo m modulo MOD, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 1, stdin is empty, t is at least 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is either 2 or 3, l is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, r is either n - 1, n - 2, n - 3 or n - 4, k is the last integer in the list + 1, k is 1. If s[k] is 'L', then ans is the product of all integers in the list divided by arr[l] modulo MOD. Otherwise, ans is the product of all integers in the list divided by arr[r] modulo MOD.***
