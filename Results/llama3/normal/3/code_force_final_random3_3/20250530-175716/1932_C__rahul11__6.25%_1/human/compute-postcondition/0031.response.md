The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, stdin is empty, and the input is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1 and stdin must have at least one input. 
State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in the list arr modulo m modulo MOD and the rest are the product of all elements in the list arr divided by either arr[l] or the last element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin is not empty, t is at least 0, i is the last element in the list, c is n, l is n, r is -1, k is n - 1**
