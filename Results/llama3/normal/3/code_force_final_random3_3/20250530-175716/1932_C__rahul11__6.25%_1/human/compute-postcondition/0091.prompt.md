Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in the list arr modulo m modulo MOD and the rest are the product of all elements in the list arr divided by either arr[l] or the last element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty, t is at least 0, i is the last element in the list, c is n, l is n, r is -1, k is n - 1, and the elements of the list res are printed, which are the product of all elements in the list arr modulo m modulo MOD and the rest are the product of all elements in the list arr divided by either arr[l] or the last element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in the list modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 1, stdin is empty, t is at least 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is n, l is n, r is 0, k is n - 1, and the elements of the list res are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, c is n, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 0, stdin is empty, l is n - 1 if the number of 'L's in s is equal to n - 1, otherwise l is n - 1 - (the number of 'L's in s), r is 0 if the number of 'L's in s is equal to 0, otherwise r is the number of 'L's in s, k is n - 1, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, and ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the product of all integers at indices l and r in arr modulo MOD, and the list res is printed, where the first element of res is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest of the elements in res are not explicitly defined in the precondition




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
