The code prints the elements of the list `res`, which contains `n` integers. The first element of `res` is the product of all integers in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. The remaining elements of `res` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so their values cannot be determined precisely.

However, based on the given information, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, followed by n-1 integers (where n is at least 2)**
