Output State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all integers in the list modulo `m` modulo MOD, `ans` is the product of all integers in the list divided by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo MOD, MOD is 1000000006, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is 3, `l` is either 0, 1 or 2, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is the last integer in the list + 1. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `l` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `l` is either 0 or 1. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, otherwise `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1, so the new value of `c` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
