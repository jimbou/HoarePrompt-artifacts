Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the product of the array elements is zero. In this case, the program will output incorrect results because it does not handle the case when the product is zero before taking the modulus. 

For example, if the input is:

3 6
0 1 2
LRL

The program will output:

0 0 0

However, the correct output should be:

0 2 4

This is because when the product of the array elements is zero, the remainder when divided by m is also zero, but the program does not correctly handle this case. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
