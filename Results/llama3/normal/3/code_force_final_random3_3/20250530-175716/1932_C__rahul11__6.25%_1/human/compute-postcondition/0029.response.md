The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list.

Based on the initial state, the `res` list contains `n` integers. The first element of `res` is the product of all elements in the `arr` list modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. The rest of the elements in `res` are the product of all elements in the `arr` list divided by either `arr[l]` or the last element of `arr` modulo `MOD` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `m`, and `MOD` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated products.

Output: **product of all elements in arr modulo m modulo MOD, product of all elements in arr divided by arr[l] modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, ..., product of all elements in arr divided by the last element of arr modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD**
