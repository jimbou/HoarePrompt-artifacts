Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers (n and m), a list of n integers, and a string of n characters ('L' or 'R'). The function calculates the product of the integers modulo m modulo MOD, then iteratively updates this product by dividing it by the integers at specific indices based on the characters in the string. The updated products are stored in a list, which is then printed. The function repeats this process for each test case until stdin is empty.**
