Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is at least 3, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all elements in the list arr modulo m modulo MOD. If s[k] is 'L', the second element of res is the product of all elements in the list arr divided by arr[l-1] modulo MOD modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros. If s[k] is not 'L', the third element of res is the product of all elements in the list arr divided by the last element of arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest are zeros except the first one. ans is the product of all elements in the list arr divided by either arr[l] or the last element of arr modulo MOD. If s[k] is 'L', ans is not divided by arr[r] modulo MOD. If s[k] is not 'L', ans is divided by arr[r] modulo MOD. _ is 0, stdin is empty, t is at least 0, i is the last element in the list, c is 4, l is either 0, 1, or 2, r is either n - 1, n - 2, or n - 3, and k is 2.**

In this output state, the value of c has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
