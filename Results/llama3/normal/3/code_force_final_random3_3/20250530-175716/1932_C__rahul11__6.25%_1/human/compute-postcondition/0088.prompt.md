Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1, k is n - 1, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, ans is the product of all integers in the list arr, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, c is 2, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 0, and stdin is empty. If the character at index k of the list s is 'L', then l is 1, r is n - 1, k is 0, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, and ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the integer at index l in arr modulo MOD. Otherwise, l is 0, r is n - 2, k is 0, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, and ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the integer at index r of arr modulo MOD.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all integers in `arr` modulo `m` modulo MOD, `c` is 3, MOD is 1000000006, `_` is 0, and `stdin` is empty. If the character at index `k` of the list `s` is 'L', then `l` is 1, `r` is `n` - 1, `k` is 1, `t` is at least 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `arr`, and `ans` is the product of all integers in the list `arr` divided by the integer at index `l` in `arr` modulo MOD. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 2, `k` is 1, `t` is at least 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `arr`, and `ans` is the product of all integers in the list `arr` divided by the integer at index `r` of `arr` modulo MOD. The third element of `res` is the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integer at index `l` or `r` in `arr` modulo `m` modulo MOD, depending on whether the character at index `k` of the list `s` is 'L' or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all integers in `arr` modulo `m` modulo MOD, the third element is the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integer at index `l` or `r` in `arr` modulo `m` modulo MOD, depending on whether the character at index `k` of the list `s` is 'L' or not, and the fourth element is the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integer at index `l` or `r` in `arr` modulo `m` modulo MOD, depending on whether the character at index `k` of the list `s` is 'L' or not, `c` is 4, MOD is 1000000006, `_` is 0, `l` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the character at index `k` of the list `s` is 'L' or not, `r` is either `n` - 1 or `n` - 2 depending on whether the character at index `k` of the list `s` is 'L' or not, `k` is 2, `t` is at least 1, `i` is the last integer in the list `arr`, `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integer at index `l` or `r` in `arr` modulo MOD, depending on whether the character at index `k` of the list `s` is 'L' or not, and stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
