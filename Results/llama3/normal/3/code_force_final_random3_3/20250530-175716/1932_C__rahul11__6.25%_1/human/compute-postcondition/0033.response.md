According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is the last element in the list. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is 1, `MOD` is 1000000006, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 0, `i` is the first integer in the list, `c` is n, `l` is n, `r` is -1, `k` is n - 1**
