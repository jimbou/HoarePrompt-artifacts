Output: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, c is n, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 0, stdin is empty, l is n - 1 if the number of 'L's in s is equal to n - 1, otherwise l is n - 1 - (the number of 'L's in s), r is 0 if the number of 'L's in s is equal to 0, otherwise r is the number of 'L's in s, k is n - 1, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, and ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the product of all integers at indices l and r in arr modulo MOD, and the list res is printed, where the first element of res is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the rest of the elements in res are not explicitly defined in the precondition**
