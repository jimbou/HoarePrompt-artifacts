Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in the list modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in the list, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 1, stdin is empty, t is at least 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1, k is n - 1
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer that is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all integers in the list modulo `m` modulo MOD, `ans` is the product of all integers in the list divided by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo MOD, MOD is 1000000006, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is 2, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `ans` is divided by `arr[l]`. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is divided by `arr[r]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of characters, `res` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is the product of all integers in the list modulo `m` modulo MOD, `ans` is the product of all integers in the list divided by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` modulo MOD, MOD is 1000000006, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is at least 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is 3, `l` is either 0, 1 or 2, `r` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is the last integer in the list + 1. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `l` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `l` is either 0 or 1. If `s[k]` is 'L', then `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, otherwise `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer that is at least 3, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in the list modulo m modulo MOD, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 1, stdin is empty, t is at least 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is either 3 or 4, l is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, r is either n - 1, n - 2, n - 3 or n - 4, k is the last integer in the list + 1, k is 1. If s[k] is 'L', then ans is the product of all integers in the list divided by arr[l] modulo MOD. Otherwise, ans is the product of all integers in the list divided by arr[r] modulo MOD.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
