Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.**

The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value 1000000006, which is a large prime number often used in competitive programming for modular arithmetic. The value of `MOD` is now fixed and will not change. The rest of the initial state remains the same, with stdin containing the input data for the test cases.
