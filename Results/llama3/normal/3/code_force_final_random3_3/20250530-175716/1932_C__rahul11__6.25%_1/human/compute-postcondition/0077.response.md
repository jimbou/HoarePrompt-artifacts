Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of characters, res is a list of n integers where the first element is the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, c is 2, MOD is 1000000006, _ is 0, and stdin is empty. If the character at index k of the list s is 'L', then l is 1, r is n - 1, k is 0, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, and ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the integer at index l in arr modulo MOD. Otherwise, l is 0, r is n - 2, k is 0, t is at least 1, i is the last integer in the list arr, and ans is the product of all integers in the list arr divided by the integer at index r of arr modulo MOD.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of c has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
