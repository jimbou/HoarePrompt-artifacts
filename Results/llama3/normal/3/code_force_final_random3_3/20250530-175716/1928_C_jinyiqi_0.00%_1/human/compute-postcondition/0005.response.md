To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. `i` is 2. If the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, then output1 is a list containing 1 and output2 is a list containing `x`.**
