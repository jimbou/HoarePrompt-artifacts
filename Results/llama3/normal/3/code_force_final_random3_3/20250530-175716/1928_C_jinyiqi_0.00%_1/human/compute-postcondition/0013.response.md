Output State: **The program returns a list that contains all the quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1` and all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order. The divisors are of a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1.**
