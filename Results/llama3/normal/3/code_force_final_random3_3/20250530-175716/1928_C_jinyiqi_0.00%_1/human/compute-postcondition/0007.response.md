Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, then output1 is a list containing 1 and 2, output2 is a list containing `x` and `x` divided by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to output1 and output2.***
