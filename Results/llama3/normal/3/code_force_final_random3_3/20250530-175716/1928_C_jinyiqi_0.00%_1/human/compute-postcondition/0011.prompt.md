Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, output1 is an empty list, output2 is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        output1.append(i)
        output2.append(int(x / i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. `i` is 1. If the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, then output1 is a list containing 1 and output2 is a list containing `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 2. If the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, then output1 is a list containing 1 and 2, output2 is a list containing `x` and `x` divided by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to output1 and output2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 4, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` is a list containing 1, 2, and 3, and `output2` is a list containing `x`, `x` divided by 2, and `x` divided by 3. Otherwise, `output1` is a list containing 1 and 2, and `output2` is a list containing `x` and `x` divided by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
