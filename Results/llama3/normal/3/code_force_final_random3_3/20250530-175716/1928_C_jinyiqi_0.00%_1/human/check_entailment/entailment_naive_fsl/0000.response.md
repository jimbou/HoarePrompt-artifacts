Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. It first checks if (n + x - 2) and (n - x) are even, and if so, it finds the divisors of these numbers using the func_1 function. It then filters the divisors to only include those that are greater than or equal to x and have a remainder of 2 when divided by 2. The program correctly handles the case where k = 2, which is a special case mentioned in the problem description.

The func_1 function correctly finds all the divisors of a given number x. It iterates from 1 to the square root of x, checks if x is divisible by i, and if so, adds i and x/i to the list of divisors. The function then reverses the order of the divisors and returns the combined list.

The program correctly handles the case where n = x, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. In this case, the program will not find any divisors for (n + x - 2) and (n - x), and therefore will not include k = 2 in the output.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints, and handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
