Output State: **`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1`**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `output1` is reversed, meaning that the order of the divisors is now in reverse order. The value of `output2` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
