#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1.

    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)

    #State: `x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1`.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that contains all the quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1` and all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order. The divisors are of a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It calculates all divisors of the input list that are less than or equal to the square root of the input list, along with their corresponding quotients. The function returns a list containing these quotients and divisors in reverse order, effectively providing all divisors of the input list.
