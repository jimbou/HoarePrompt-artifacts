Output State: **`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `x` remains a list of two integers with the first integer greater than the second, and the second integer greater than 1. The list `output1` will contain all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by each of these divisors.
