Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 4, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` is a list containing 1, 2, and 3, and `output2` is a list containing `x`, `x` divided by 2, and `x` divided by 3. Otherwise, `output1` is a list containing 1 and 2, and `output2` is a list containing `x` and `x` divided by 2.***
