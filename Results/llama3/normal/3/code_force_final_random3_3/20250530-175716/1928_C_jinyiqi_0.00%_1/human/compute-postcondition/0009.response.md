Output State: **x is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 4, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, i is 3, output1 is a list containing 1, 2, and 3, output2 is a list containing x, x divided by 2, and x divided by 3.**

In this output state, the value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 3. The list `output1` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 3, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`. The list `output2` is appended with the integer value of `x` divided by `i`, which is `x` divided by 3.
