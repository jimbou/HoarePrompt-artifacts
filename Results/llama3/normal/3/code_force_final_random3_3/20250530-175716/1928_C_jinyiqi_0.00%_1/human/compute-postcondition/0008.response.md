To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):`.

The objects in the loop head are `i` and `x`. Since `x` is a list of two integers, we can only adjust the value of `i` and the value of `x` as a whole, not the individual elements of the list.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The value of `x` is not changed by the loop body, so it remains the same. However, we need to ensure that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute again. Since `x` is a list of two integers, we can assume that the value of `x` is the first element of the list. Let's call this value `x_val`.

We know that `x_val` is greater than or equal to 1, and the second integer in the list is greater than 1. To ensure that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 3, we need `x_val` to be greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 4, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing 1 and 2, `output2` is a list containing `x` and `x` divided by 2**
