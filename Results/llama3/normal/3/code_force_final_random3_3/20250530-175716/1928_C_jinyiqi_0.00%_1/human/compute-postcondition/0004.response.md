Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers that must be greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. `i` is 1. If the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, then output1 is a list containing 1 and output2 is a list containing `x`.***
