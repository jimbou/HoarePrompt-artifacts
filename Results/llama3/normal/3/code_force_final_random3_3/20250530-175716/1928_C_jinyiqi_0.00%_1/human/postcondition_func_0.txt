This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It calculates all divisors of the input list that are less than or equal to the square root of the input list, along with their corresponding quotients. The function returns a list containing these quotients and divisors in reverse order, effectively providing all divisors of the input list.
