Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description requires the string to consist of uppercase Latin letters, but the program generates a string consisting of digits ('1' and '0'). This does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs "YES" and "110110", which is not a string of uppercase Latin letters.
