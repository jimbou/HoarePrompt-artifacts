Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` is a string of '110' repeated n//2 times, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `t` is still an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The new variable `s` is assigned a string value, which is the repetition of '110' for `n//2` times. The stdin still contains `t-5` lines, each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50 inclusive.
