Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which is the first line of input from stdin. The value of `t` remains the same, and `_` is still 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50 inclusive, since one line has been read and assigned to `n`.
