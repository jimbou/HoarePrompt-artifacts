Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` is a string of '110' repeated n // 2 times, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `_` remains 1, the value of `t` is still an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, the value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. A new variable `s` is introduced, which is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The stdin still contains `t-3` lines, each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50 inclusive.
