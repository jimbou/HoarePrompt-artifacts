Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `t` is still an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which is the input from the user. The stdin now contains t-5 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), as one line has been consumed by the input statement.
