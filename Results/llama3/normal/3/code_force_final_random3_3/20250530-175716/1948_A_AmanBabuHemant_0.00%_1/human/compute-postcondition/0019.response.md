Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), since one line has been consumed by the input statement. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
