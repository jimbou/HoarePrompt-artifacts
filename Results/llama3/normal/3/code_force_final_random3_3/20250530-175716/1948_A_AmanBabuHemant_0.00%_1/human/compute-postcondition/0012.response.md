Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). The current length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is being printed, and the string `s` which is '110' repeated `n // 2` times is being printed**
