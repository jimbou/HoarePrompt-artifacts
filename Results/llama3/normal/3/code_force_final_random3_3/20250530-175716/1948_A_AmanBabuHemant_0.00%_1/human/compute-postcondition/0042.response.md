Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` is a string of '110' repeated n//2 times, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and a string of '110' repeated n//2 times is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
