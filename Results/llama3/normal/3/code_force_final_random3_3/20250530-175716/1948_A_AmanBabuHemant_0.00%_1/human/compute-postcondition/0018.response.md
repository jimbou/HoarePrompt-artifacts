The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` of '110' repeated `n // 2` times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, 'NO' is printed.**
