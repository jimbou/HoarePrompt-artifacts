This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers. For each subsequent integer n, the function checks if n is even or odd. If n is odd, it prints 'NO'. If n is even, it generates a string s consisting of '110' repeated n // 2 times and checks its length. If the length of s is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string s. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all t integers and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
