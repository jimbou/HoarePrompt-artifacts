Output State: **_ is t-1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains 0 lines. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` of '110' repeated `n // 2` times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variable `_` has reached the value of `t-1`. The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` remains an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The stdin contains 0 lines, indicating that all input lines have been processed. The output state also describes the final output of the loop, which depends on the parity of `n` and the length of the string `s`.
