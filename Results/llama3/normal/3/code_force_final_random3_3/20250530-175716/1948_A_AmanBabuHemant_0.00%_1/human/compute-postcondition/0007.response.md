Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `_` is 0, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and is even, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a string that consists of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, where `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).
