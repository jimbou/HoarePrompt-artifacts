To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since `i` is not defined before the loop, we can define it as 0, which is the starting value for the range function.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is `n`**
