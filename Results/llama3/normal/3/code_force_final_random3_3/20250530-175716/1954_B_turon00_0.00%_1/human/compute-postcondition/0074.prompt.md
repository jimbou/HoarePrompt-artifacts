Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    aa = set(a)
    if len(aa) == 1:
        print(-1)
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt`, and the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt` which is either 0 or the original value of `ans` (whichever is smaller) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is either greater than 0 or equal to 0, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and `cnt` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum between the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, and the minimum between the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a` which is `ans` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
