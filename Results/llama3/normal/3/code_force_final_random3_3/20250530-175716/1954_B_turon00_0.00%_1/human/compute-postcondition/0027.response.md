Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, i is not defined, cnt is not defined, ans is not defined, stdin is empty**

The code snippet reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, replacing its original value. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns the list to `a`, replacing its original value. The first element of the new list `a` is assigned to `tmp`, replacing its original value. Finally, a set of unique integers from the new list `a` is created and assigned to `aa`, replacing its original value.

The variables `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not defined after the code execution because they were not assigned any values in the given code snippet. The variable `t` and `_` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. Stdin is empty after the code execution because two inputs were read from it.
