Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, i is 0, cnt is 0, ans is min(n, 0)**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` (which is initially `n`) and `cnt` (which is initially 0) to `ans`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the minimum value is 0, so `ans` becomes 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
