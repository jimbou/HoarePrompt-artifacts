The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `ans` is initially `n` and `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, i is 0, cnt is 0, ans is 0, and stdin is empty.**
