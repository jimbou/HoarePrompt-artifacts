The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes 0. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, cnt is 0, ans is 0, i is 0, and the current element of a at index i is not equal to tmp**
