Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`, and `ans` is the minimum between the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum between its previous value and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
