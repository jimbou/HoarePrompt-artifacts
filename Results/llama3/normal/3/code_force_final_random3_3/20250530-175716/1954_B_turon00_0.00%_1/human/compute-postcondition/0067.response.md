Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3, and `ans` is `n`. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `i` is 2, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 3. If the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
