Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, i is 2, cnt is 0, ans is either 0 or n, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 2 or 1 and `ans` is either `n` or 0, the minimum value will be either 0 or 1. Therefore, `ans` becomes either 0 or 1. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`, making `cnt` equal to 0. No other variables are affected.
