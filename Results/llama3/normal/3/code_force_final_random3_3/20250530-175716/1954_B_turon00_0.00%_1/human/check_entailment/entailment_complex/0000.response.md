Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers.
2.  It checks if all elements in the list are the same by converting the list to a set and checking its length. If all elements are the same, it prints -1, which is the correct output according to the problem statement.
3.  If not all elements are the same, it initializes a variable `ans` to `n` (the length of the list) and a variable `cnt` to 0. It then iterates over the list, incrementing `cnt` whenever it encounters the first element of the list (`tmp`). Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
4.  After iterating over the entire list, it updates `ans` one more time to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, to account for the case where the last elements of the list are all the same as the first element.
5.  Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the list. This is the correct output according to the problem statement.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
