Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

2. If not all elements are the same, the program iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. 

3. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.

4. Finally, it prints the minimum count of consecutive occurrences, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
