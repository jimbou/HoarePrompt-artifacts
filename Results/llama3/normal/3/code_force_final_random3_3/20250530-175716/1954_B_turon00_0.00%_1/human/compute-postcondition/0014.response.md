To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is 1**
