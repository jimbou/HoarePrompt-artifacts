Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is the minimum of the original value of `ans` and `cnt`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the value of `cnt`, which is either 0 or 1. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
