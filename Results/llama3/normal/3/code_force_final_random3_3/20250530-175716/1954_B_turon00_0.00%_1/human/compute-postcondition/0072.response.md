The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum between the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in `a` and the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`. 

Here, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of `a`. 

Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element of `a` in `a`.

Output: **minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element of `a` in `a`**
