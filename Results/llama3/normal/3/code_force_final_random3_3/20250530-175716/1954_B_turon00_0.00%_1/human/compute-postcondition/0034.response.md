Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains integers, and `tmp` is still equal to the first element of `a`. The set `aa` still contains unique integers from `a`. The index `i` is still 0, and `a[i]` is still equal to `tmp`. The value of `ans` is still `n`, and `stdin` is still empty.
