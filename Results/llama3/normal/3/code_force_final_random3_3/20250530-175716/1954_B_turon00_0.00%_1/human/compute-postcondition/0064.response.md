Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer and must be greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, i is 1, ans is the minimum of n and cnt, and cnt is 0.**

The code first assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum of `n` and 0. Then, `cnt` is reset to 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain unchanged.
