Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is either 2 or 1, `ans` is either `n` or 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
