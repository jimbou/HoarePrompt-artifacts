Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is `n`. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
