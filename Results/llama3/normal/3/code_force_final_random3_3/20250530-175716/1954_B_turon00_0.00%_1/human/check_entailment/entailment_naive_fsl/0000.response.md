Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only two distinct elements, and the first and last elements are the same. In this case, the program will print the count of the first element, but it should print 1, because removing one element can make the array not beautiful.

For example, the input:

5
1 2 1 2 1

The program will print 2, but the correct answer is 1.
