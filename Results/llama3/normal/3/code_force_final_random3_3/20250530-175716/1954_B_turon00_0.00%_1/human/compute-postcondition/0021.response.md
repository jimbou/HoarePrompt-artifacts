Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.**
