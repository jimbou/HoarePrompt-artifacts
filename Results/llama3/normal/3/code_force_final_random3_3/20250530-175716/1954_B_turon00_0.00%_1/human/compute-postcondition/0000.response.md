The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer `t`, then for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers. After the code is executed, the first input integer is removed from the stdin, and the remaining inputs are still present.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers.**
