Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is either greater than 0 or equal to 0, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `a` contains at least one element equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is either greater than 0 or equal to 0, and `ans` is either 0 or greater than 0. If `a` does not contain any element equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.
