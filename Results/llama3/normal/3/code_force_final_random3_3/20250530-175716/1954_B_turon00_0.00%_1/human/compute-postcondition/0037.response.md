Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is an integer equal to the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.***
