Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer and must be greater than 2, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, i is 2, ans is the minimum of n and cnt, and cnt is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans` and `cnt`. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `ans` is initially equal to `n` when `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, and `cnt` is 2, `ans` becomes 2. When `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is already the minimum of `n` and `cnt`, so its value remains unchanged. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
