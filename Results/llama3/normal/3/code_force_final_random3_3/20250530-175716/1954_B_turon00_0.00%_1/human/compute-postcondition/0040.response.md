Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, i is 1, ans is 0, cnt is 0, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either 0 or `n`, the minimum value will always be 0. Therefore, `ans` becomes 0. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`. 

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The value of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The `stdin` also remains empty.
