Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, tmp is an integer equal to the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, i is not defined, cnt is 0, ans is n, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable cnt. The second line assigns the value of n to the variable ans. Since n is an integer, ans becomes an integer as well. No other variables are affected by the code.
