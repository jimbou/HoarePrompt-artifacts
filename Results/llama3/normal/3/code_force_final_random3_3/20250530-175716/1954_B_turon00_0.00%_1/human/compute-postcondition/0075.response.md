Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first integer in the list and prints this value. If all integers in the list are the same, it prints -1. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
