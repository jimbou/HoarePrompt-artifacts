The code prints the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive).
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), and this is printed: m // a + m // b + 2, where m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), and b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive)**
