Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the first set of three space-separated integers from the input, which are between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18).
