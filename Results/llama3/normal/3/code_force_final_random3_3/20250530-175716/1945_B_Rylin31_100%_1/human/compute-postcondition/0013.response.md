Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), stdin is empty, and this is printed: m // a + m // b + 2, where m is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), a is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), and b is an integer between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive), for all sets of three space-separated integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18) that were initially in stdin.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0, `i` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the last set of three space-separated integers read from stdin, stdin will be empty, and the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` will be printed for all sets of three space-separated integers `a`, `b`, and `m` that were initially in stdin.
