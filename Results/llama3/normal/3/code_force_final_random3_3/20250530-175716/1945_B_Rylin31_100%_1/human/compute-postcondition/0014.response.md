Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression m // a + m // b + 2 for each test case. The function continues to read and process test cases until all input has been consumed, at which point it terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
