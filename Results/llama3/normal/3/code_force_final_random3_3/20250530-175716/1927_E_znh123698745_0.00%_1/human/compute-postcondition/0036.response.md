The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list.

Based on the precondition, the `answer` list contains the integers 1 and all the elements of the `array` list in reverse order if `n` is odd, or the integers 1 and all the elements of the `array` list in ascending order if `n` is even.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine whether the elements of `array` will be printed in reverse or ascending order. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

If `n` is odd, the `answer` list will contain the integers 1 and all the elements of `array` in reverse order. For example, if `n` is 5, the `array` list will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and the `answer` list will be [1, 5, 4, 3, 2].

If `n` is even, the `answer` list will contain the integers 1 and all the elements of `array` in ascending order. For example, if `n` is 4, the `array` list will be [1, 2, 3, 4], and the `answer` list will be [1, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `answer` list, which depends on the value of `n`.

Output: **1 and the elements of array in reverse order if n is odd, or 1 and the elements of array in ascending order if n is even**
