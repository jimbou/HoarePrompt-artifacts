The `print(*answer)` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list.

The `answer` list contains integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order, starting from 1. This means that the list will have the following structure: `[1, 3, 5, ..., n-1, n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2]`.

Since `n` is an integer equal to the first input, the exact value of `n` is not specified. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `answer` list in the specified order.

Output: **1, 3, 5, ..., n-1, n, n-2, n-4, ..., 2 (where n is the first input)**
