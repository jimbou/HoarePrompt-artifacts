The first line appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to `answer`. Since `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `a[-1]` is -1. `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, so `array[-1]` is `n`. Therefore, `answer` now contains the integers 1 and `n`.

The second line decrements the last element of `a` by 1. Since `a[-1]` is -1, it becomes -2.

The value of `i` is not affected by the code, so it remains 1.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and n, a is a list containing the integers 1 and -2, stdin is empty, i is 1.**
