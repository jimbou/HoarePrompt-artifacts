Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and all the elements of array in reverse order if n is odd, or the integers 1 and all the elements of array in ascending order if n is even, a is a list containing the integers 1 and -n if n is odd, or the integers n and -1 if n is even, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `k`, `array`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The `answer` list will contain the integer 1 followed by all the elements of `array` in reverse order if `n` is odd, or in ascending order if `n` is even. The `a` list will contain the integers 1 and -n if `n` is odd, or the integers n and -1 if `n` is even.
