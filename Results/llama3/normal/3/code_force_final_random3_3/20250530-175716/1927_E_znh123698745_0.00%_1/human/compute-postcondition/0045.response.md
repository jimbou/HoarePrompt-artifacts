Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, i is 1, k is an integer equal to the second input, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin is empty. If (-1) ** i == -1, then answer is a list containing the integers 1 and array[-1], and a is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. Otherwise, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and array[1], a is a list containing the integers 2 and -1, and ((-1) < k < (n - i)).***
