Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3 (if `n` is 3) or `i` is greater than 2 (if `n` is greater than 3), `answer` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and an additional element appended from `array`. If `i` is odd, the last element of `a` is decremented by 1. If `i` is even, the first element of `a` is incremented by 1.**
