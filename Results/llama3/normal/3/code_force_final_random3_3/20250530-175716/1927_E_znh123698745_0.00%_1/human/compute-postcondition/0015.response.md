Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is unknown but increased by 1. If `i` is odd, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 and `answer` contains the value of `array[a[-1]]`. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list containing the first element of `array` and `a` is a list with its first element incremented by 1.**
