Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.**
