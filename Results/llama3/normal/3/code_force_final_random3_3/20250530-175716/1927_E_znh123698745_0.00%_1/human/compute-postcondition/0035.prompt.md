Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integer 1, a is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if (-1) ** i == -1:
        answer.append(array[a[-1]])
        a[-1] -= 1
    else:
        answer.append(array[a[0]])
        a[0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is at least 2, k is an integer equal to the second input, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin is empty. If i is odd, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and the last element of array, and a is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. If i is even, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and a is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2 (if `n` is 2) or `i` is greater than 1 (if `n` is greater than 2). If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and an additional element appended from `array`, `a` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and the last element decremented by 1. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and now includes the first element of `array`, `a` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and now its first element is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3 (if `n` is 3) or `i` is greater than 2 (if `n` is greater than 3), `answer` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and an additional element appended from `array`. If `i` is odd, the last element of `a` is decremented by 1. If `i` is even, the first element of `a` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
