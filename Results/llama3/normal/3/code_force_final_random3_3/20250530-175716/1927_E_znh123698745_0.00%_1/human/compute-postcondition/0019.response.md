To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.


The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are the input from `stdin` and the loop variable `_` (which is not explicitly used in the loop body, but is still part of the loop head).


At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, there must be another input available in `stdin`. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used, so we don't need to adjust its state.


The other variables `n`, `k`, `array`, `answer`, and `a` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.


State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and -`n`, `stdin` is not empty, and the elements of the list `answer` are being printed**
