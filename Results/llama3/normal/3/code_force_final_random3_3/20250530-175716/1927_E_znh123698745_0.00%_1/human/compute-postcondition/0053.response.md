Postcondition: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, then `array` is decremented by 1 at index `a[-1]` and `answer` contains the value of `array` at index `a[-1]` before decrementing. Otherwise, `answer` is a list containing the first element of `array`, `a` is a list containing a single integer equal to 1.**
