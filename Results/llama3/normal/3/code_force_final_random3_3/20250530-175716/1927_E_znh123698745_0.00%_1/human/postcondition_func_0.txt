This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k, and generates a list of integers from 1 to n in alternating order starting from 1. It then prints this list for each test case. The function iterates over all input test cases, updating the variables n and k accordingly, and finally prints the list of integers in alternating order for the last test case.
