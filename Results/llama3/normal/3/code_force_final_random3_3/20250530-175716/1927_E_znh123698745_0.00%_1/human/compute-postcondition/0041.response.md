Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `i` is odd, since `(-1) ** i` equals -1.**
