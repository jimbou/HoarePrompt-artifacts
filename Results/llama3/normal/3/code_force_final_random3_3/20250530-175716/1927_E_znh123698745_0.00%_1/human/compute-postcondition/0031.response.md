The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 (if `n` is 2) or `i` is greater than 1 (if `n` is greater than 2), `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3 (if `n` is 3) or `i` is greater than 2 (if `n` is greater than 3), `answer` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and an additional element appended from `array`, `a` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and the last element decremented by 1 or the first element incremented by 1**
