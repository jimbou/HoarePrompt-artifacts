Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2 (if `n` is 2) or `i` is greater than 1 (if `n` is greater than 2). If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and an additional element appended from `array`, `a` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and the last element decremented by 1. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and now includes the first element of `array`, `a` is a list with values depending on whether `i` is odd or even and now its first element is incremented by 1.***
