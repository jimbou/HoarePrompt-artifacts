Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integer 1, a is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if (-1) ** i == -1:
        answer.append(array[a[-1]])
        a[-1] -= 1
    else:
        answer.append(array[a[0]])
        a[0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is odd, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is unknown but increased by 1. If `i` is odd, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 and `answer` is appended with the value of `array` at index `a[-1]` before decrement. If `i` is even, `answer` has one more element which is the first element of `array` and `a[0]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is unknown but increased by 1. If `i` is odd, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 and `answer` contains the value of `array[a[-1]]`. If `i` is even, `answer` is a list containing the first element of `array` and `a` is a list with its first element incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
