Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5), where k is even.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(range(1, n + 1))
    answer = [1]
    a = [1, -1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (-1) ** i == -1:
            answer.append(array[a[-1]])
            a[-1] -= 1
        else:
            answer.append(array[a[0]])
            a[0] += 1
    print(*answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and -`n`, `stdin` is empty, and the elements of the list `answer` are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and all the elements of array in reverse order if n is odd, or the integers 1 and all the elements of array in ascending order if n is even, a is a list containing the integers 1 and -n if n is odd, or the integers n and -1 if n is even, stdin is empty, and the elements of the answer list are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list of integers from 1 to n in alternating order starting from 1, a is a list containing the integers n and -1, stdin is empty, i is n-1, and the list of integers from 1 to n in alternating order starting from 1 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
