Reasoning:

The given program is designed to construct a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. The program works by creating an array of numbers from 1 to n and then constructing the permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k, where k is even.
3. It creates an array of numbers from 1 to n using the list comprehension `list(range(1, n + 1))`.
4. It initializes the answer array with the number 1, which is the smallest number in the array.
5. It defines a list `a` with two elements: 1 and -1. The value of `a[-1]` is used to keep track of the index of the next smallest number to be added to the answer array, and the value of `a[0]` is used to keep track of the index of the next largest number to be added to the answer array.
6. The program then enters a loop that runs from 1 to n-1. In each iteration, it checks whether the current index `i` is even or odd using the expression `(-1) ** i == -1`.
7. If `i` is even, it appends the smallest remaining number to the answer array by accessing the array at index `a[-1]`. It then decrements the value of `a[-1]` to point to the next smallest number.
8. If `i` is odd, it appends the largest remaining number to the answer array by accessing the array at index `a[0]`. It then increments the value of `a[0]` to point to the next largest number.
9. After the loop finishes, the program prints the constructed permutation.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired k-level permutation for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
