Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list of integers, `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and -`n`, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `k`, `array`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The `answer` list will contain a sequence of integers, and the `a` list will contain the integers `n` and `-n`.
