Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is unknown but increased by 1. If `i` is odd, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 and `answer` is appended with the value of `array` at index `a[-1]` before decrement. If `i` is even, `answer` has one more element which is the first element of `array` and `a[0]` is increased by 1.***
