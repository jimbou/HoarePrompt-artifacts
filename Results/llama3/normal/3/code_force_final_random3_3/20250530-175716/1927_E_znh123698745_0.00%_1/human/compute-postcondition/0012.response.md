The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unknown but increased by 1, `n` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than `i` + 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is unknown but increased by 1**
