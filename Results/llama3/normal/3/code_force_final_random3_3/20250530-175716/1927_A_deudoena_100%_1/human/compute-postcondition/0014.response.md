Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is the position of the first 'B' in the string s, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', c is the length of the string s, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', j is the last character in the string s.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `mi` will hold the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `c` will be equal to the length of the string `s`, and `j` will be the last character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
