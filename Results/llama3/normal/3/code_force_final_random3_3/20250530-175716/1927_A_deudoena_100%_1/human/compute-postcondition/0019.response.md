Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or the length of string `s` minus 1, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `m-1` integers and `m-1` strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and the current value of `j` is either 'B' or one of the characters in `s` other than 'B'. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is the length of string `s` minus 1. Otherwise, `ma` remains 0.***
