Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or the length of string `s` minus 2 depending on whether the next `j` is 'B', `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 3, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `m-1` integers and `m-1` strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B`, and the current value of `j` is the next character in the reverse order of `s`. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is updated to the length of string `s` minus 3.***
