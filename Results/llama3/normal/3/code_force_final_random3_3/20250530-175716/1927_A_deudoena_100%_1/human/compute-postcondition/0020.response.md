To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for j in s[::-1]:`. The loop head involves the string `s` and the variable `j`.

Given that `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and the loop iterates over `s` in reverse order (`s[::-1]`), we need to adjust the state of `j` and `s` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is either 'B' or one of the characters in `s` other than 'B'. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is the length of string `s` minus 1. Otherwise, `ma` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character to iterate over in reverse order. Since `s` is being iterated over in reverse, the next character to be assigned to `j` would be the one before the current `j` in the reverse order of `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or the length of string `s` minus 1, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `m-1` integers and `m-1` strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and the current value of `j` is the character before the current `j` in the reverse order of `s`. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is the length of string `s` minus 1. Otherwise, `ma` remains 0.**
