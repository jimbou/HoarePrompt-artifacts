Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is the position of the last 'B' in the string `s`, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is the length of the string `s`, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `m-1` integers and `m-1` strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and the current value of `j` is the first character in the string `s`.**

The loop iterates over the string `s` in reverse order, and for each character `j`, it increments `d` by 1. If `j` is 'B', it updates `ma` to the current position of `j` in the string `s`. The loop continues until it has iterated over all characters in the string `s`. At the end of the loop, `ma` will hold the position of the last 'B' in the string `s`, and `d` will be equal to the length of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
