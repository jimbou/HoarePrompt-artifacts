Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 1, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least 2 'B's, c is 1, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', the first character in the string s, j, is 'B'.**

The code assigns the value of `c` to `mi`, making `mi` equal to 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
