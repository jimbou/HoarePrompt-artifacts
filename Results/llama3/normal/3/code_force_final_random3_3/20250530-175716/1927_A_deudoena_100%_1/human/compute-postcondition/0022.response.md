Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is the length of string s minus 2, mi is the position of the first 'B' in the string s, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', c is the length of the string s, d is 2, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and j is the character before the current j in the reverse order of s. If j is 'B', then ma is the length of string s minus 2. Otherwise, ma remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ma` has been updated to be the length of string `s` minus 2, as a result of the line `ma = len(s) - d`. The value of `d` remains 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
