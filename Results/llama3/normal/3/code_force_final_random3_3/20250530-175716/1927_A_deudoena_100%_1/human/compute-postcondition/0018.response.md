Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is the length of string s minus 1, mi is the position of the first 'B' in the string s, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', c is the length of the string s, d is 1, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and the current value of j is 'B'.**

The first line assigns the value of `len(s) - d` to `ma`. Since `d` is 1, `ma` becomes the length of string `s` minus 1. The second line is a break statement, which does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
