Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 0, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', c is 0, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'.
Code of the loop:
for j in s:
    c += 1
    if j == 'B':
        mi = c
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 1 if the first character in the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 0, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least 2 'B's, c is 1, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 2 if the second character in the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 1, s is a string of length between 2 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least 2 'B's, c is 2, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', j is the second character in the string s

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, s is a string of length between 2 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least 2 'B's, c is 3, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', j is the third character in the string s. If the third character in the string s is 'B', then mi is 3. Otherwise, mi is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
