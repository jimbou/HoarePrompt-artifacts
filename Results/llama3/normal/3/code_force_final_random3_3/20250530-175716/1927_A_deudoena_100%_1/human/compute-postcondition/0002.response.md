Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 0, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least 2 'B's, c is 1, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', j is the first character in the string s.**

In this output state, the value of c has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'. The string s still has at least 2 'B's and j is still the first character in the string s.
