The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and string `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, string `s` has at least 2 characters. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 2 characters and `j` is the second character in the string `s`. 
State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 1 if the first character in the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 0, s is a string of length between 2 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least 2 'B's, c is 1, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', j is the second character in the string s**
