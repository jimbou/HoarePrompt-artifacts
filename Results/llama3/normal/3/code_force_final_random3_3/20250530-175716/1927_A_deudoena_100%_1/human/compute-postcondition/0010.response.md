To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the string `s`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be the next character in the string `s`.

Since `s` is a string of length between 2 and 10, and it has at least 2 'B's, we can assume that the next character in the string `s` is the third character.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 2 if the third character in the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 1, s is a string of length between 2 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least 2 'B's, c is 2, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', j is the third character in the string s**
