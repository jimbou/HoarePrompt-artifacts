Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 0, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', c is 0, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'.**

The first line initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `m`. The third line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The fourth line initializes `c` and `d` to 0. The fifth line initializes `l` as an empty list. After the execution of the code, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` and `mi` are 0, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `c` and `d` are 0, and `l` is an empty list. Stdin now contains `m-1` integers and `m-1` strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'.
