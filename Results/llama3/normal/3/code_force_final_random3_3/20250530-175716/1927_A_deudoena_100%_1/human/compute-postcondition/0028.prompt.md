Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is the position of the first 'B' in the string s, s is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', c is the length of the string s, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', j is the last character in the string s.
Code of the loop:
for j in s[::-1]:
    d += 1
    if j == 'B':
        ma = len(s) - d
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or the length of string `s` minus 1, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `m-1` integers and `m-1` strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and the current value of `j` is either 'B' or one of the characters in `s` other than 'B'. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is the length of string `s` minus 1. Otherwise, `ma` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or the length of string `s` minus 2, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `m-1` integers and `m-1` strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', and the current value of `j` is the character before the current `j` in the reverse order of `s`. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is the length of string `s` minus 2. Otherwise, `ma` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or the length of string `s` minus 2 depending on whether the next `j` is 'B', `mi` is the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 3, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains `m-1` integers and `m-1` strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B`, and the current value of `j` is the next character in the reverse order of `s`. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is updated to the length of string `s` minus 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
