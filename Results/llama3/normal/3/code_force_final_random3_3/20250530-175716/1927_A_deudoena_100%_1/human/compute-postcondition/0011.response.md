Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 2 if the third character in the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 1, s is a string of length between 2 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least 2 'B's, c is 3, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains m-1 integers and m-1 strings of length between 1 and 10 consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B', j is the third character in the string s**

The code increments the value of c by 1. The initial value of c is 2, so the new value of c is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.
