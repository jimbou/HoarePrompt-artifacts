The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and stdin contains `t-1` inputs, each an integer, the new value of `x` will be one of these integers. The second line assigns the value of `x // 2` to `y`. Since `x` is now one of the input integers, `y` will be half of that integer.

Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 1000, y is an integer equal to x // 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-2 inputs: each an integer (2 <= x <= 1000)**
