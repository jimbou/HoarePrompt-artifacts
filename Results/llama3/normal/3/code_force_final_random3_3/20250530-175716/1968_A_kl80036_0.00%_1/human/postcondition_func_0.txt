This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer (t) specifies the number of subsequent integers to read. For each of these integers (x), it calculates and prints the integer division of x by 2. The function continues this process until all specified integers have been read and processed, at which point it concludes, leaving the standard input empty.
