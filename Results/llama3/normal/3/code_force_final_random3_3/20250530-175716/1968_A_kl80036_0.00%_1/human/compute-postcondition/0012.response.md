Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 1000, y is an integer equal to x // 2, i is t-1, stdin contains 0 inputs, and the value of y which is equal to x // 2 is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable x will hold the last integer input from stdin, y will be half of this integer, the loop counter i will be one less than the initial number of test cases t, and there will be no more inputs left in stdin. The value of y, which is half of x, will be printed as the output.
