To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is at least 1.

State: **stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (t) (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing an integer (x) (2 <= x <= 1000), i is 0, int(input()) must be greater than 0**
