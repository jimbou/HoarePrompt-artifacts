Based on the precondition, we know that `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `y` is an integer equal to `x // 2`. The `print` statement simply prints the value of `y`.

Since `y` is equal to `x // 2`, we can infer that `y` will be an integer between 1 and 500 (since `x` is between 2 and 1000).

Therefore, the output will be the value of `y`, which is an integer between 1 and 500.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 500 (which is the value of y)**
