Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 1000, y is an integer equal to x // 2, i is 1, stdin contains t-2 inputs: each an integer (x) (2 <= x <= 1000)**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `x`, which was previously a positive integer. Since the input is between 2 and 1000, `x` becomes an integer within this range. The second line assigns the value of `x // 2` to `y`, making `y` equal to the integer division of `x` by 2. The value of `y` is now an integer equal to `x // 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains `t-2` inputs, each an integer between 2 and 1000, as one input has been consumed by the code.
