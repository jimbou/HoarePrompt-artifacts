The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of inputs in stdin. If `i` is less than the number of inputs in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-2 inputs. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and stdin must contain at least t-1 inputs.
State: **x is an integer between 2 and 1000, y is an integer equal to x // 2, i is 2, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each an integer (x) (2 <= x <= 1000)**
