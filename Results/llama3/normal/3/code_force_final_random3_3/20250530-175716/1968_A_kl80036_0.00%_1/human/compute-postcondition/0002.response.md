Based on the initial state, we know that `y` is a non-negative integer, but its exact value is not specified. The `print(y)` statement will output the current value of `y`.

Since `y` is not modified or assigned a specific value in the given code snippet, its value remains unknown. However, we can describe its value based on the precondition.

Output: **y (where y is a non-negative integer)**
