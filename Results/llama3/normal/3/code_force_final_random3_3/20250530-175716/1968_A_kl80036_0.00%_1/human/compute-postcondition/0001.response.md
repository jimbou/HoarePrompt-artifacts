The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` is an integer and `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `x` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns the value of `x // 2` to `y`. Since `x` is a positive integer, `y` becomes a non-negative integer. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **x is a positive integer, y is a non-negative integer, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each an integer (x) (2 <= x <= 1000)**
