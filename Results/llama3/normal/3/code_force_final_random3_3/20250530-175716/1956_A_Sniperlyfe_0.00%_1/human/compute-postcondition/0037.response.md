To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for n in qs:`. This means we can only adjust the states of `n` and `qs`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `qs` must have at least 1 element, and `n` is the first element of `qs`. For the loop to execute again, `qs` must have at least 2 elements, and `n` must be the second element of `qs`.

State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `t` is 1, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a string of space-separated integers**
