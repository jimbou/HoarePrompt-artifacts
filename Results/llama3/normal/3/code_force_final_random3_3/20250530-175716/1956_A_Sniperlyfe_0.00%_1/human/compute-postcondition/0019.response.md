Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the first element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `n` and `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `func_1(n, p)` is not specified, so it is left as is in the output state.
