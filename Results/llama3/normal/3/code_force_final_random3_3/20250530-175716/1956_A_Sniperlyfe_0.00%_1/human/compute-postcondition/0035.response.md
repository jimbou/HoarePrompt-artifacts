The code prints a string containing the elements of the `res` list, separated by spaces. The `res` list contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element of `qs` and `p` is a list of integers. Since the exact values of `n` and `p` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of `func_1(n, p)` as a string of space-separated integers.

Output: **result of func_1(n, p) (where n is the first element of qs and p is a list of integers)**
