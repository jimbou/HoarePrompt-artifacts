Output State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `t` is 1, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a string of space-separated integers twice.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, since the code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. The result of `func_1(n, p)` is also printed as a string of space-separated integers twice, since the initial state mentions that the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a string of space-separated integers.
