To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to worry about its state. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n` and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer greater than 0**
