The `print` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, which contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice. Since `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, and `p` is a list of positive integers, the output will be the results of `func_1` applied to these values, repeated twice.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p), result of func_1(n, p)] (where n is the second element in the list qs and p is a list of positive integers)**
