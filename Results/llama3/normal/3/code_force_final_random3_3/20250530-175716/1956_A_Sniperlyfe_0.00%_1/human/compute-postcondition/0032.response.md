Output State: **k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of integers, qs is a list of integers, res is an empty list, n is not defined, t is 1**

The code snippet reads three lines of input and assigns the values to the variables k, q, p, and qs. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to k and q. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to p. The third line assigns a list of integers from the input to qs. The fourth line initializes an empty list res. 

The initial state of res containing the results of func_1(n, p) for all elements n in the list qs is overwritten by the empty list. The initial state of n being the last element that was processed in the list qs is no longer valid since qs is now a new list of integers. The values of t, k, and q remain unchanged.
