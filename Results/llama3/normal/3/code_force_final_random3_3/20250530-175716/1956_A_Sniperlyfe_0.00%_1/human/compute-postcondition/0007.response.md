The only variables in the loop head are variables  `n` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` has at least 1 element, `n` is the first element in the list `qs`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and `n` is the second element in the list `qs`.
State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**
