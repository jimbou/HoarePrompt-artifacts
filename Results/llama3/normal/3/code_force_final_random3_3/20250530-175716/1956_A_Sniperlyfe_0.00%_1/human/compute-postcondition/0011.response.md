To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for n in qs:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` has at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 3 elements, and `n` must be the third element in the list `qs`.

State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice**
