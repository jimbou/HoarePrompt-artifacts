The code prints a string containing the results of two function calls to `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, and `p` is a list of positive integers. The results are converted to strings and joined together with spaces in between.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where n is the second element in the list qs and p is a list of positive integers)**
