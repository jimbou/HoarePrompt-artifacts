To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all elements `n` in the list `qs`
* `qs` is empty
* `n` is the last element that was processed in the list `qs`
* `p` remains unchanged
* `t` has been decremented to 0
* `k` and `q` remain unchanged

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state of `t`, as it is the only variable in the loop head. Since `t` is currently 0, we need to increment it to 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all elements `n` in the list `qs`, `qs` is empty, `n` is the last element that was processed in the list `qs`, `p` remains unchanged, `t` is 1, `k` and `q` remain unchanged**
