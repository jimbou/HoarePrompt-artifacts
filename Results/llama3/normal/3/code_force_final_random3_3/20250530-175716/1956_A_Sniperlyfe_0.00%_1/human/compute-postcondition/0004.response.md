Output State: **`n` is the first element in the list `qs`, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `n` and `p`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so its output is unknown, but it is appended to the list `res`.
