To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `n` and `qs`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `n` is not defined before the loop, we need to define it as the first element of `qs`.

State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `t` is 1**
