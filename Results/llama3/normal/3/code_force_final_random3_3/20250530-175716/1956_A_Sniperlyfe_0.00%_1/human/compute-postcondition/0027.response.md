Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed twice, separated by a space**

In this output state, the list `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, as the code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
