The function takes a positive integer `n` and a sorted list of positive integers `p` as input, and for each element `n` in a list of query integers `qs`, it calls another function `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to a list `res`. After processing all elements in `qs`, it prints the final state of `res` with all elements separated by spaces. The function does not modify the input list `p` or the variables `k` and `q`.
