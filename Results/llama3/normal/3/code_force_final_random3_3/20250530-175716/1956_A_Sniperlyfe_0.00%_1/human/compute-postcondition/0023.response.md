Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**

The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `res` now contains the original result of `func_1(n, p)` and the same result appended to it.
