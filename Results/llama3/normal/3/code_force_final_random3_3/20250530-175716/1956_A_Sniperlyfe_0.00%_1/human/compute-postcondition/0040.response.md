Output: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `t` is 1, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a string of space-separated integers twice, and this is printed: "result of func_1(n, p) result of func_1(n, p)"**
