Output State: **`qs` is an empty list, `n` is the last element in the initial list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each element in the initial list `qs`, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each element in the initial list `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `qs` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The variable `n` will hold the last element from the initial list `qs`. The lists `p`, `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The list `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element in the initial list `qs`. These results are printed as a string of space-separated integers.
