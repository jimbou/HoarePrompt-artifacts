Output State: **k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of integers, qs is an empty list, res is a list containing the result of func_1(n, p) for all elements n in the initial qs, n is the last element of the initial qs, t is 1, and the result of func_1(n, p) is printed as a string of space-separated integers for all elements n in the initial qs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for k, q, p, and t as in the initial state. The list qs will be empty because the loop iterates over all its elements. The list res will contain the results of func_1(n, p) for all elements n in the initial qs. The variable n will hold the value of the last element in the initial qs. The results of func_1(n, p) for all elements n in the initial qs will be printed as strings of space-separated integers.
