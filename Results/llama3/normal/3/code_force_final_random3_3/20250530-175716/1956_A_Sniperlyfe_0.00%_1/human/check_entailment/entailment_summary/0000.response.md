Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. The function `func_1(n, p)` simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the game based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed. The function `func_2()` reads the input, calls `func_1(n, p)` for each query integer `n`, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the game simulation and query processing as described in the problem statement. It handles the edge cases where the number of players `n` is less than the minimum value in the sequence `p`, and it correctly prints the results for each query integer `n`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
