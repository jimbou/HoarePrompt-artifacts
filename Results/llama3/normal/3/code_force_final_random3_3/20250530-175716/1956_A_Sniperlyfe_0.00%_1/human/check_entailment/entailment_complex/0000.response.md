Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the number of players declared as winners in a game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and the number of players n_i. The game rules state that in each round, the a_1-th, a_2-th, ..., a_k-th players are kicked out simultaneously, and the game ends when no one is kicked out in a round.

Function func_1 implements the game logic. It takes a non-negative integer n and a list of non-negative integers p as input, where all elements in p are less than or equal to n. The function repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in p that are less than or equal to n from n until n is less than the minimum value in p. This process simulates the game rounds, and the final value of n represents the number of players declared as winners.

Function func_2 is the main function that reads input, processes test cases, and prints the results. It reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads the length of the sequence k, the number of query integers q, the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, and the query integers n_1, n_2, ..., n_q. For each query integer n_i, it calls func_1 with n_i and the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_k as input and appends the result to a list res. Finally, it prints the list res with all elements separated by spaces.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the game logic and processes the input according to the problem description. The use of func_1 to simulate the game rounds and calculate the number of winners is correct, and the main function func_2 correctly reads input, processes test cases, and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
