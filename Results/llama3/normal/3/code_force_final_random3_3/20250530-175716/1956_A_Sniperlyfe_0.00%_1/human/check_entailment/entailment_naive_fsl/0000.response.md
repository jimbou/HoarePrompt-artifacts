Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly simulates the game and determines the number of winners for each test case.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `p`, where `n` is the number of players and `p` is the list of positions to be eliminated. It simulates the game by repeatedly eliminating players at the positions specified in `p` until no more players can be eliminated. The remaining players are declared as winners.

`func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the number of players is less than the minimum position to be eliminated, the game ends immediately, and all players are declared as winners.
* When the number of players is greater than or equal to the minimum position to be eliminated, the game continues until no more players can be eliminated.
* When the list of positions to be eliminated is empty, the game ends immediately, and all players are declared as winners.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the number of players is 1 or when the list of positions to be eliminated contains only one element.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
