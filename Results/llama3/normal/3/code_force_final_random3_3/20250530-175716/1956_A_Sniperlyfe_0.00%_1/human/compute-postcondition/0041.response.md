The only variable in the loop head is `n` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `qs`.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` has at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element of `qs`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `n` is the third element of `qs`.
State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, `n` is the third element of `qs`, `t` is 1, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a string of space-separated integers twice, and this is printed: "result of func_1(n, p) result of func_1(n, p)"**
