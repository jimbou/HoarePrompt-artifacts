Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the list `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all elements `n` in the list `qs`. The list `qs` is empty, and the variable `n` is the last element that was processed in the list `qs`. The list `p` remains unchanged, and the variable `t` has been decremented to 0. The variables `k` and `q` remain unchanged. The final state of the list `res` is printed, with all elements separated by spaces.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has completed its execution, and the list `res` now contains the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element `n` in the list `qs`, along with the corresponding list `p`. The list `qs` is now empty, and the variable `n` holds the last element that was processed. The list `p` remains unchanged, and the variable `t` has been decremented to 0. The variables `k` and `q` remain unchanged. Finally, the entire list `res` is printed, with all elements separated by spaces.
