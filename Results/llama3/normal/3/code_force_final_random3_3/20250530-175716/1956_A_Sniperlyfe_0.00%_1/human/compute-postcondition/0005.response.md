The `print` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, which contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`. Since the exact definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The `map(str, res)` expression converts each element of the `res` list to a string, and the `' '.join(...)` expression concatenates these strings with spaces in between.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, p) (where n is the first element of the list qs and p is a list of positive integers)**
