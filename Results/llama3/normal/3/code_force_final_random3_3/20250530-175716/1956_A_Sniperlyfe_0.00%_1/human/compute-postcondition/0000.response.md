Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n` and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer**.

In this output state, the values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code only reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `t` with its assigned value, which is an integer.
