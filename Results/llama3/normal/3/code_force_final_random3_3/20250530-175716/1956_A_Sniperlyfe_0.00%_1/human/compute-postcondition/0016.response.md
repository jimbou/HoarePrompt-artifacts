To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`qs` is an empty list, `n` is the last element in the initial list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each element in the initial list `qs`, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each element in the initial list `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers.**
