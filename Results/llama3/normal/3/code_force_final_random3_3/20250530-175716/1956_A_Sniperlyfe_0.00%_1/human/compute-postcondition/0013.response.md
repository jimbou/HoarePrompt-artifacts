Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `qs` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements.
* `n` is the third element in the list `qs`.
* `p` is a list of positive integers.
* `t` is an integer greater than 0.
* `k` is an integer.
* `q` is an integer.
* `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times.

The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the `res` list into a single string, separated by spaces. The `map` function is used to convert each element of the `res` list to a string using the `str` function.

Since the exact values of `n`, `p`, and the function `func_1` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `res` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)]**

where each `[result of func_1(n, p)]` represents the result of calling the `func_1` function with `n` and `p` as arguments, repeated three times.
