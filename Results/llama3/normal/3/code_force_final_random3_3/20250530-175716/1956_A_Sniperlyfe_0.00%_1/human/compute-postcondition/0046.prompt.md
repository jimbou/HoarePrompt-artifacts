Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n` and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `qs` is an empty list, `n` is the last element in the initial list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each element in the initial list `qs`, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each element in the initial list `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has finished executing, and the list `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all elements `n` in the list `qs`. The list `qs` is empty, and the variable `n` is the last element that was processed in the list `qs`. The list `p` remains unchanged, and the variable `t` has been decremented to 0. The variables `k` and `q` remain unchanged. The final state of the list `res` is printed, with all elements separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of integers, qs is an empty list, res is a list containing the result of func_1(n, p) for all elements n in the initial qs, n is the last element of the initial qs, t is 1, and the result of func_1(n, p) is printed as a string of space-separated integers for all elements n in the initial qs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
