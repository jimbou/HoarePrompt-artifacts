Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves simulating a game where players are kicked out based on a given sequence of integers. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `p`, where `n` is the number of players and `p` is the sequence of integers. It simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the game based on the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed. The function returns the number of players remaining in the game, which is the number of winners.

`func_2` is the main function that reads input from the user, calls `func_1` for each query, and prints the results. It reads the number of test cases, the length of the sequence `p`, the number of queries, the sequence `p`, and the queries. For each query, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to the list `res`. Finally, it prints the list `res` with all elements separated by spaces.

The program correctly implements the logic of the game and the problem description. It handles all possible inputs correctly, including edge cases where the number of players is 0 or the sequence `p` is empty.

Correctness: **True**
