Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

The `res` list contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times. Since `n` is the third element of `qs`, and `qs` has at least 3 elements, `n` is a valid integer. The result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed as a string of space-separated integers.

When the print statement is executed, it will print the elements of the `res` list, which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` three times, separated by spaces.

Output: **result of func_1(n, p) result of func_1(n, p) result of func_1(n, p)**
