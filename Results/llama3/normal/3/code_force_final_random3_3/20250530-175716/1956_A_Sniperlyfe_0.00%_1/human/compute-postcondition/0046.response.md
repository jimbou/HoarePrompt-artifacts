Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the list `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all elements `n` in the list `qs`. The list `qs` is empty, and the variable `n` is the last element that was processed in the list `qs`. The list `p` remains unchanged, and the variable `t` has been decremented to 0. The variables `k` and `q` remain unchanged. The final state of the list `res` is printed, with all elements separated by spaces.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element `n` in the list `qs` with the list `p` as the second argument. The list `qs` will be empty, and the variable `n` will hold the value of the last element that was processed in `qs`. The list `p` will remain unchanged, and the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables `k` and `q` will retain their initial values. Finally, the contents of the list `res` will be printed as a string of space-separated integers.
