Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: qs is a list of integers, n is the last element in the list qs, p is a list of positive integers, t is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, k is an integer, q is an integer, res is an empty list, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for n in qs:
    res.append(func_1(n, p))
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the first element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and the elements of the list `res` are being printed, separated by spaces

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed twice, separated by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is printed twice, separated by a space, and the following is printed: the result of `func_1(n, p)` three times, separated by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
