Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times**

In this output state, the list `res` now contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times, in addition to the previous two results. The other variables remain unchanged.
