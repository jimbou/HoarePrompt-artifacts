The code prints a string of space-separated integers, where each integer is an element in the `res` list. The `res` list contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element in the list `qs` and `p` is a list of positive integers. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values in the `res` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of `func_1(n, p)` as a string of space-separated integers.

Output: **result of func_1(n, p) (where n is the first element in the list qs and p is a list of positive integers)**
