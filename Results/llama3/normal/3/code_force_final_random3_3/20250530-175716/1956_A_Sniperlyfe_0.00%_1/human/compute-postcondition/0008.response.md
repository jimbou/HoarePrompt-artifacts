Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, `p` is a list of positive integers, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice.**

In this output state, the list `res` has been updated to include the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, as the code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.
