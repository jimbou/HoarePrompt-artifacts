Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
