The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, win_with_swap and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `win_with_swap` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`, `win_with_swap` is increased by 1 and `k` is greater than `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is `win_with_swap + 2` and `k` is greater than `i`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is increased by 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`.**
