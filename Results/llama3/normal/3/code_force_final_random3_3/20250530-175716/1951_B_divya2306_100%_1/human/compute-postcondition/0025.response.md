Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap`.**

In this output state, the value of `win_with_swap` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than `k`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1. The value of `i` is still equal to `win_with_swap`, which has been incremented.
