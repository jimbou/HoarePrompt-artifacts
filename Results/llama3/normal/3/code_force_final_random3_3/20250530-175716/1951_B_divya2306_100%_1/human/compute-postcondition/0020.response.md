Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is n. The number of iterations of the loop (`wins`) is less than `k`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of iterations of the loop (`wins`) has been incremented by 1 and assigned to `win_with_swap`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the loop iterations and the comparison between `a[i]` and `a[k - 1]` still apply.
