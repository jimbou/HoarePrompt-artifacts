Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `wins` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `wins` being equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the relationship between `a[i]` and `a[k - 1]` still apply.
