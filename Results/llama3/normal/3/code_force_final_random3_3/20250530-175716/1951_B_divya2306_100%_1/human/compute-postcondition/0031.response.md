Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is increased by 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, `win_with_swap`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the `break` statement. However, the program now breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside, which is the only change in the output state.
