Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
