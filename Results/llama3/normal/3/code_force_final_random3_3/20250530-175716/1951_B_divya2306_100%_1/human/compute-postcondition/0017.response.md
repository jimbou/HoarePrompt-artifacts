Output: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is n. The current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. and the number of wins minus 1 is printed, where the number of wins is the number of iterations of the loop which is greater than or equal to k**
