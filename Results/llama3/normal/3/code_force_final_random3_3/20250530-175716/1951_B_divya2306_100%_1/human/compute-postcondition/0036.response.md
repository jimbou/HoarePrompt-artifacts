Output: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is increased by `wins`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. The maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1` plus 1 if `wins` is not equal to 0 is being printed.**
