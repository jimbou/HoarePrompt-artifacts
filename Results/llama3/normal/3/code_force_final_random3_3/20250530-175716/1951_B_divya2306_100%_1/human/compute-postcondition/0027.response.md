Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables maintain their initial values, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, `win_with_swap`, and `i` remain unchanged, and we still have multiple test cases minus one in the standard input. However, we break out of the innermost loop or if statement, which may affect the control flow of the program.
