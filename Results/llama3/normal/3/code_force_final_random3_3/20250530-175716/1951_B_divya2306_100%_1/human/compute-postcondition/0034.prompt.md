Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is n. The number of iterations of the loop (`wins`) is less than `k`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    win_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is increased by 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
