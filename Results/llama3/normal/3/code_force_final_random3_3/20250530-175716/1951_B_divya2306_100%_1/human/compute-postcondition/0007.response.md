Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
