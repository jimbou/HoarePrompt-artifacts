The code prints the value of `wins - 1`, where `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop. Since the current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `wins - 1` will be at least `k - 1`. However, the exact value of `wins - 1` cannot be determined without knowing the exact value of `wins`.

Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is the number of iterations of the loop and is greater than or equal to k)**
