Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is less than `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `a[i]` is still greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`. The other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
