Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the cow's rating is the highest among all cows. In this case, the cow will win all matches, but the program will not correctly calculate the number of wins.

For example, consider the input:

3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1

The program will output:

1
2
0

However, the correct output should be:

1
2
1

The program incorrectly calculates the number of wins for the third test case, where the cow's rating is the highest among all cows.
