Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `wins` is the number of iterations of the loop, `win_with_swap` is less than `k`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `win_with_swap`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`***
