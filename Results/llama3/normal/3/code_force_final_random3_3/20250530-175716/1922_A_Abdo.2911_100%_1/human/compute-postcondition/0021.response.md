Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or b, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, possible is set to True.***
