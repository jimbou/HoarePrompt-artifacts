To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we can make the state more specific by stating that `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so its value is not important.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
