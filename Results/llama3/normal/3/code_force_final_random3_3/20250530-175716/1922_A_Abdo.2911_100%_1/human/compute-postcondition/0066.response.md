Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n, possible is True if there exists at least one index j such that a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is not equal to a[j] and c[j] is not equal to b[j], and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, and the variable `possible` is set to True if there exists at least one index `j` where the characters at index `j` in strings `a` and `b` are different and the character at index `j` in string `c` is not equal to the characters at index `j` in strings `a` and `b`. If no such index `j` exists, the value of `possible` remains False. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
