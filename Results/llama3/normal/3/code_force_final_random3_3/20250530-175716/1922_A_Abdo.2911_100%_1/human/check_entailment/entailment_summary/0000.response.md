Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c.
2. If the characters at the current position in a and b are the same, it checks if the character at the same position in c is different from the characters in a and b. If it is, it sets the `possible` flag to True and breaks the loop.
3. If the characters at the current position in a and b are different, it checks if the character at the same position in c is the same as either the character in a or the character in b. If it is not, it sets the `possible` flag to True and breaks the loop.
4. If the loop completes without finding a position where the strings a and b match but c does not, it sets the `possible` flag to False.
5. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the `possible` flag is True, indicating that a template t exists that matches a and b but not c, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
