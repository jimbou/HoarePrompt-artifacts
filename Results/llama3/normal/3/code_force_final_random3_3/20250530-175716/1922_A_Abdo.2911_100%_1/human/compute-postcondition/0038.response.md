The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1 and stdin contains t test cases.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n**
