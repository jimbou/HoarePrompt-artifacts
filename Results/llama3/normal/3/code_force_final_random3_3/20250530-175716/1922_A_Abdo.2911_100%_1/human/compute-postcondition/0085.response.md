Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, possible is True, stdin contains t-3 test cases, a[i] is not equal to b[i], and c[i] is neither equal to a[i] nor equal to b[i].**

The code sets the value of `possible` to `True` and then encounters a `break` statement, which terminates the loop. Since there are no other statements after the `break`, the loop ends, and the program continues executing the next lines of code. The `break` statement does not affect any variables, so the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
