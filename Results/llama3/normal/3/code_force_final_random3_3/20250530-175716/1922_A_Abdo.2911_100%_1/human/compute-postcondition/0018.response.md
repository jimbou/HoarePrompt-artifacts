Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases. The only change is that the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the program moves on to the next iteration.
