Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, possible is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases, a[i] is not equal to b[i], and c[i] is neither equal to a[i] nor equal to b[i]**.

The code sets the value of `possible` to `True` and then breaks out of the loop. The `break` statement does not affect any variables, so the only change is that `possible` is now `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
