Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, possible is True.***
