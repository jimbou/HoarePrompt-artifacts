The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since we are inside a loop that iterates over the test cases, this means that the current test case is skipped and the next test case is processed.

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are not affected by the `continue` statement.

Since we have skipped one test case, the number of remaining test cases is now `t-2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2**
