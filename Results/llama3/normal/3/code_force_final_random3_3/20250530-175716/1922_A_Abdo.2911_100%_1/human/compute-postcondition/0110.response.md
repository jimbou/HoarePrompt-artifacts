Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n. If there exists at least one index j such that a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is not equal to a[j] and c[j] is not equal to b[j], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if for all indices j, either a[j] equals b[j] or c[j] equals a[j] or c[j] equals b[j], then 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input. The variable `t` is now 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process. The input stream `stdin` is empty, as all the test cases have been read and processed. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` still hold the values of the last test case processed, and the variable `i` is still equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished processing the last test case. The output of the loop is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether there exists at least one index `j` where `a[j]` is not equal to `b[j]` and `c[j]` is neither equal to `a[j]` nor equal to `b[j]`. If such an index exists, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
