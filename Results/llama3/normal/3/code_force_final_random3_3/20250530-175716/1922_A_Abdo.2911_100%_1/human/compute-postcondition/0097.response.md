Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the character at index `i` (which is 2) in string `c` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `a`, a SyntaxError is raised due to a break statement outside a loop and possible is True. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
