Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, possible is True, i is 0, the current value of a[i] is equal to the current value of b[i], and the current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of a[i].**

The code snippet sets the value of `possible` to `True` and then breaks out of the loop. The `break` statement does not affect any variables, so the only change is that `possible` is now `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
