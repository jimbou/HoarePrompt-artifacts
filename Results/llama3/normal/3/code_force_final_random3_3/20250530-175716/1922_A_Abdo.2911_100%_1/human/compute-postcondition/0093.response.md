Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, possible is True.***
