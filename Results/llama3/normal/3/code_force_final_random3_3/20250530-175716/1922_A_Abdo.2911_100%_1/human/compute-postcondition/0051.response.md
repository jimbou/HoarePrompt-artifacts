Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and we move to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor equal to `b[i]`.***
