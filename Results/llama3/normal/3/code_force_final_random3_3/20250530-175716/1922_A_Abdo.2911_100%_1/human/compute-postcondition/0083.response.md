Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `possible` is False, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. The current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or equal to `b[i]`. We skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
