Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain the same, and the stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
