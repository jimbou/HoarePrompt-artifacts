Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, possible is True, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. The current value of a[i] is equal to the current value of b[i]. The current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of a[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`, which was initially `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `possible` is now `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
