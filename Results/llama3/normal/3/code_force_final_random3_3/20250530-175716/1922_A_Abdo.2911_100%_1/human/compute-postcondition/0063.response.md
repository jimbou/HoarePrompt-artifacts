The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the only change is the assignment of `True` to `possible`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 2, possible is True, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
