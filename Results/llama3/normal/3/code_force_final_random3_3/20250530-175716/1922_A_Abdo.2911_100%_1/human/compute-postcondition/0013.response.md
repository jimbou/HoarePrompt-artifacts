Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration, with `possible` remaining False. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True.***
