Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 2, and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the character at index i in string a is equal to the character at index i in string b, then if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, then possible is True. Otherwise, no change in the value of possible. If the character at index i in string a is not equal to the character at index i in string b, then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then we move on to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, possible is set to True.***
