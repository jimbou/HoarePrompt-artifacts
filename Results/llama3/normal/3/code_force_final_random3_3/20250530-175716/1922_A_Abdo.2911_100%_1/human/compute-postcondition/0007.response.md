Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`. If the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `possible` is True. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
