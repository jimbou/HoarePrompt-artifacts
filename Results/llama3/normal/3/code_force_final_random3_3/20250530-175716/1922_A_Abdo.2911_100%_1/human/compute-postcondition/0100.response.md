Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters. If c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then i is 3 and stdin contains t-4 test cases. Otherwise, i is 2, possible is True, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.***
