Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 0, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then if c[i] is not equal to a[i], possible is True. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or b[i], the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and possible remains False. Otherwise, possible is set to True, indicating that c[i] is neither equal to a[i] nor equal to b[i].***
