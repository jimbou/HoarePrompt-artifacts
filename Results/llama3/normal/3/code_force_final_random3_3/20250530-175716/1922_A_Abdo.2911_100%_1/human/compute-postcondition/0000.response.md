The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.

Since the code only reads the first integer `t` from the input, the remaining input remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
