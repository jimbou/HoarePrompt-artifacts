Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n, possible is False, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and we move to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor equal to `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1, and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or b, then we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, possible is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 2, and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the character at index i in string a is equal to the character at index i in string b, then if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, then possible is True. Otherwise, no change in the value of possible. If the character at index i in string a is not equal to the character at index i in string b, then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then we move on to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, possible is set to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
