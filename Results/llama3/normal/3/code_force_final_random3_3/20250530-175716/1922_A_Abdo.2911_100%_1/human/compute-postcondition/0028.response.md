Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 2. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then stdin contains t-2 test cases. Otherwise, possible is True. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, then possible is True.***
