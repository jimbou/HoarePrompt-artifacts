Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `possible` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. We skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
