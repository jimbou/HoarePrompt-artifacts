Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The program iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c. If it finds a position where a and b are the same and c is different, or if a and b are different and c is not equal to either a or b, it sets the variable "possible" to True. If "possible" is still False after checking all positions, it means that there is no position where c differs from both a and b, so it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
