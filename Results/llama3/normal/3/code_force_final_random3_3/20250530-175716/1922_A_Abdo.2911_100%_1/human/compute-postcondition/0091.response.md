Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1, and stdin contains t-3 test cases, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
