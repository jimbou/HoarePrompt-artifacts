According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which means it is already at the end of the loop. So, for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `possible` is False, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**
