The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings of the same length. It then checks if there exists at least one position where the third string differs from both the first and second strings. If such a position is found, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
