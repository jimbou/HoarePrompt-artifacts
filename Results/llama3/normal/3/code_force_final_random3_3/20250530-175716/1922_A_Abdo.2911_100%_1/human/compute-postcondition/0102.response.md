Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n, possible is True if there exists at least one index j where a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is neither equal to a[j] nor equal to b[j], and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `possible` will be `True` if there exists at least one index `j` where `a[j]` is not equal to `b[j]` and `c[j]` is neither equal to `a[j]` nor equal to `b[j]`. If no such index exists, `possible` will remain `False`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
