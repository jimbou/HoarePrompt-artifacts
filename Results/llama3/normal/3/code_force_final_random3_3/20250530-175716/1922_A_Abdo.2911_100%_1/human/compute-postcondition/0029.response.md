Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n, possible is True if there exists at least one index j such that a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is not equal to a[j] and c[j] is not equal to b[j], otherwise possible is False.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be such that 't' remains an integer greater than 0, and 'stdin' still contains 't-1' test cases. The strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' remain unchanged as strings of 'n' lowercase Latin letters. The variable 'i' will be equal to 'n', indicating that the loop has executed 'n' times. The variable 'possible' will be set to True if there exists at least one index 'j' where 'a[j]' is not equal to 'b[j]' and 'c[j]' is not equal to 'a[j]' and 'c[j]' is not equal to 'b[j]'. Otherwise, 'possible' will be False.
