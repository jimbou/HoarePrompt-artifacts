Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n, possible is False, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code block reads the next test case from stdin, which contains t-2 test cases initially. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n, which is now an integer between 1 and 20. The next three lines read strings from stdin and assign them to a, b, and c, respectively. These strings are of length n and consist of lowercase Latin letters. The variable i is not modified in the code block, so it remains equal to n. The variable possible is assigned the value False. After executing the code block, stdin contains t-3 test cases.
