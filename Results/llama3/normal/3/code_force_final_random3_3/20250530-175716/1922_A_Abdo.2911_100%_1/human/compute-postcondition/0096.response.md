The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The second line is a `break` statement, which is used to exit a loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement will raise a `SyntaxError` because it is not inside a loop.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, possible is True, and a SyntaxError is raised due to the break statement outside a loop.**
