Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, a SyntaxError is raised due to a break statement outside a loop and `possible` is True. Otherwise, no specific action is taken. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `i` is 3 and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `possible` is True, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.***
