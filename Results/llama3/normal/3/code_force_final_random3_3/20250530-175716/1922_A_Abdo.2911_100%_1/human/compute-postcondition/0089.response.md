Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 1, possible is True, and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect. 

Therefore, the only change to the initial state is the introduction of the variable `possible` with the value `True`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
