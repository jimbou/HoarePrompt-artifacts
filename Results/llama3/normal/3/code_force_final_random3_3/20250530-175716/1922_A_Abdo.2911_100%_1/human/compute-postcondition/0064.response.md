Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 2, and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then we move on to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, possible is set to True.***
