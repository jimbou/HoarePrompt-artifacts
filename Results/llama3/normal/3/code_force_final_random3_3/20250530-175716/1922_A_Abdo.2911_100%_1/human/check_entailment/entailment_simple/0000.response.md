Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c.
2. If the characters at the current index in a and b are the same, it checks if the character at the same index in c is different from the characters in a and b. If it is, it sets the `possible` flag to True and breaks out of the loop.
3. If the characters at the current index in a and b are different, it checks if the character at the same index in c is the same as either the character in a or the character in b. If it is not, it sets the `possible` flag to True and breaks out of the loop.
4. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, it means that there is no template t that can distinguish between a, b, and c, so it prints "NO".
5. If the `possible` flag is set to True, it means that there exists a template t that can distinguish between a, b, and c, so it prints "YES".

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
