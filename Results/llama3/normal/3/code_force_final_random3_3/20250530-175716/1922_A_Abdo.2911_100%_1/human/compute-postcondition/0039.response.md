Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n, possible is False, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 1 and 20, as it is assigned the value of the input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to strings of `n` lowercase Latin letters, as they are assigned the values of the input. The value of `i` is not explicitly modified by the code, but since it was initially equal to `n`, its value remains equal to `n`. The variable `possible` is introduced and assigned the value `False`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, as one test case is processed by the code.
