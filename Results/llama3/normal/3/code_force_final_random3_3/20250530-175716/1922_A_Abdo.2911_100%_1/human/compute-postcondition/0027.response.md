Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is 2. If c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then stdin contains t-2 test cases. Otherwise, possible is True.***
