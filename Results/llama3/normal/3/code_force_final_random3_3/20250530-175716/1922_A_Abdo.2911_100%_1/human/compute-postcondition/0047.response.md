Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0, `possible` is False, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. The current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or equal to `b[i]`. We skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `possible` remain the same as in the initial state. The `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases. The condition `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and the current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or equal to `b[i]` still holds true. The only change is that we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement.
