The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and `possible` is False does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `possible` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
