Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 20, a is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, b is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, c is a string of n lowercase Latin letters, i is n, and stdin contains t-3 test cases. If there exists at least one index j where a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is neither equal to a[j] nor equal to b[j], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, for all indices j, a[j] is equal to b[j] or c[j] is equal to a[j] or equal to b[j], and 'NO' is printed.***
