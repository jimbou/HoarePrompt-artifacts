The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since we are directly inside a loop, we will move on to the next iteration of that loop. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are not affected by the `continue` statement. However, since we are moving on to the next iteration, the value of `i` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration. Also, since we are moving to the next iteration, we will consume one test case from `stdin`, so the number of test cases in `stdin` will be reduced by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 3, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**
