The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are directly inside a loop, we move on to the next iteration of that loop. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, and we move on to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
