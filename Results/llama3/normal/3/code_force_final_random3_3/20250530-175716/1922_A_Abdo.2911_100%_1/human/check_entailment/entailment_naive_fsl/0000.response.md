Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The program iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c. If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], it means that the template can have a lowercase letter at this position, and both a and b will match it, but c will not. If a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], it means that the template can have an uppercase letter at this position, and both a and b will match it, but c will not.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], when a[i] != b[i] and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], and when a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

The program also correctly handles the case when n = 1, as shown in the first test case in the example.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
