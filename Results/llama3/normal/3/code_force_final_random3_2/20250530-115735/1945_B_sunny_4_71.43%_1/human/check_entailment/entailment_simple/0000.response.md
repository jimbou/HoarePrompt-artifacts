Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input values `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.
* It calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation (`A`) and the second installation (`B`) by dividing `m` by `a` and `b` respectively, and adding 1 to account for the firework that is visible for `m+1` minutes.
* It prints the sum of `A` and `B`, which represents the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The execution states provided as comments also confirm that the program is working as expected.

Correctness: **True**
