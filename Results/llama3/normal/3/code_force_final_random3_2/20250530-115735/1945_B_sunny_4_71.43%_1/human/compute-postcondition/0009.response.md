To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only variable in the loop head is `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. Since `_` is not explicitly defined, we can assume it is an iteration counter that starts from 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `t`. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, its value at the start of the next iteration will be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **t is an integer greater than 1, t-2 lines remain in stdin, a, b, and m are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), A is an integer equal to int(m / a) + 1, B is an integer equal to int(m / b) + 1, and this is printed: A + B which is equal to (int(m / a) + 1) + (int(m / b) + 1)**
