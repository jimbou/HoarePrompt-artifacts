Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), adding 1 to the result, and then summing up the results for both installations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Read the number of test cases (t) and iterate over each test case.
2. For each test case, read the frequency of launching for the first installation (a), the second installation (b), and the time the firework is visible in the sky (m).
3. Calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation by dividing m by a and adding 1. This is because the first installation launches fireworks every a minutes, so the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is the number of times a fits into m, plus 1 (since the first firework is launched at time 0).
4. Calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the second installation by dividing m by b and adding 1. This is similar to step 3, but for the second installation.
5. Sum up the results from steps 3 and 4 to get the total maximum number of fireworks that can be seen.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that the first firework is launched at time 0, and that the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is the number of times the frequency of launching fits into the time the firework is visible in the sky, plus 1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
