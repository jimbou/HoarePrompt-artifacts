To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution). The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**
