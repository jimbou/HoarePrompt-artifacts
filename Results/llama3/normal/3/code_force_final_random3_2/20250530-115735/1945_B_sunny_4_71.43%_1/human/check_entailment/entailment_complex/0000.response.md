Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly reads the input, calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously for each test case, and prints the result.

The key insight is that the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is the sum of the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation. This is because the fireworks from each installation are launched at different times, and the visibility period of each firework is m + 1 minutes.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation by dividing the visibility period (m) by the launch frequency (a or b) and adding 1. This is because the first firework is launched at time 0, and subsequent fireworks are launched at intervals of a or b minutes. The maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation is therefore the ceiling of the division of m by a or b, plus 1.

The program then correctly prints the sum of the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation, which is the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Correctness: **True**
