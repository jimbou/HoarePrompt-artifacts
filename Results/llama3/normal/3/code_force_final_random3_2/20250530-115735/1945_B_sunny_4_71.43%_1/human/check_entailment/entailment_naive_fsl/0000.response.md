Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic is sound, and the code correctly implements the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation separately. This is done by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), and then adding 1 to account for the first firework.

2. The program then adds the number of fireworks from each installation to get the total number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

3. The program handles the case where the time the firework is visible in the sky is less than the frequency of launching for an installation. In this case, the number of fireworks from that installation is 1 (the first firework).

4. The program also handles the case where the time the firework is visible in the sky is greater than or equal to the frequency of launching for an installation. In this case, the number of fireworks from that installation is the integer division of the time the firework is visible in the sky by the frequency of launching, plus 1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
