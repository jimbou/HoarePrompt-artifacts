Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin is empty, a, b, and m are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), A is an integer equal to int(m / a) + 1, B is an integer equal to int(m / b) + 1, and the sum of A and B is printed which is equal to int(m / a) + 1 + int(m / b) + 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `t` remains unchanged, stdin is empty because all lines have been read, `a`, `b`, and `m` are still integers within the specified range, `A` and `B` are still calculated based on `m`, `a`, and `b`, and the sum of `A` and `B` is printed.
