Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. For each test case, it calculates the ceiling of the division of m by a and b, adds 1 to each result, and prints their sum. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.**
