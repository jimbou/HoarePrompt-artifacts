The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18). 

So, after executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18).**
