Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), taking the ceiling of the division, adding 1 to each result, and printing their sum.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately models the situation. The ceiling of the division of m by a (or b) represents the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by the first (or second) installation within the time the firework is visible in the sky. Adding 1 to each result accounts for the fact that the first firework is launched at time 0, so there is an extra firework visible in the sky. The sum of these two values represents the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
