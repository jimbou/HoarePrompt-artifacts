Postcondition: ***_ is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned to the values from the next line of input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30). If 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the integer division of `n` by 2 multiplied by `b` is printed.***
