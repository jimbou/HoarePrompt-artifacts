Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

2. The program then checks if the number of yogurts (n) is odd or even. If n is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If 2 * a is cheaper, it calculates the total cost as n * a. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as (n // 2) * b + a.

3. If n is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If 2 * a is cheaper, it calculates the total cost as n * a. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as (n // 2) * b.

4. The program prints the calculated total cost for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
