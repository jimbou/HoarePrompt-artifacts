Postcondition: ***_ is 0, n is an even integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), input() must be greater than 0. If 2a is less than b, the product of a and n is printed, where a is an integer between 1 and 30 and n is an even integer between 1 and 100. Otherwise, if 2a is larger than or equal to b, this is printed: n // 2 * b where n is an even integer between 1 and 100, and b is an integer between 1 and 30.***
