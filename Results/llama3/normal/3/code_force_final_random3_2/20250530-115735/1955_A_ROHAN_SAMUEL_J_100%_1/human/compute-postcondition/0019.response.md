The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, int(input()) is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again int(input()) must be greater than 1.
State: **_ is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `input()` must be greater than 1**
