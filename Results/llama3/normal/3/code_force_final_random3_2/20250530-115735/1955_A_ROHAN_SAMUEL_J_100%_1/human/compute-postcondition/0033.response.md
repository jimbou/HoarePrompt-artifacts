Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is greater than 1, `b` is greater than 1, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to be greater than 1, as they are assigned the values from the input, which is greater than 1. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed. The previous ranges of `n`, `a`, and `b` are no longer valid, as they have been updated with new values.
