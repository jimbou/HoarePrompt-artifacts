Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `input()` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned from the input, which contains three integers on each line. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains t-1 lines of input, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The condition that `input()` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
