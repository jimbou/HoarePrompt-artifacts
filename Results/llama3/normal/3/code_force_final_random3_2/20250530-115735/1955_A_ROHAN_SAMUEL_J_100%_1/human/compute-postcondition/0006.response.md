Postcondition: **_ is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `input()` must be greater than 0, and 2 * a is greater than or equal to b**
