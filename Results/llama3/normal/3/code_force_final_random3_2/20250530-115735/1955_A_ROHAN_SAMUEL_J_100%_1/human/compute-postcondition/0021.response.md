Based on the precondition, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned to the values from the next line of input. Since `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the values from the next line of input.

The `print` statement prints the product of `a` and `n`. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the product `a * n` will be an integer between `a` and `30 * 100`.

Therefore, the output will be the product of `a` and `n`, where `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.

Output: **a * n (where a is an integer between 1 and 30, and n is an integer between 1 and 100)**
