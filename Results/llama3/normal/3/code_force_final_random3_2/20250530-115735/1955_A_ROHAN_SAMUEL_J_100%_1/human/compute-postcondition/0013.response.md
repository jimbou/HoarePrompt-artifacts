Output: **_ is 0, n is an even integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), input() must be greater than 0. The current value of 2a is less than the current value of b, and the product of a and n is printed, where a is an integer between 1 and 30 and n is an even integer between 1 and 100**
