Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles and calculates the minimum cost based on the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

The program correctly handles the cases where n is odd or even and the relationship between a and b. If n is odd, it checks if 2 * a is less than b and prints the minimum cost accordingly. If n is even, it checks if 2 * a is less than b and prints the minimum cost accordingly.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes all input lines, calculates the results based on the given conditions, and prints the corresponding results.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
