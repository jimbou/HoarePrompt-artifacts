Output: **_ is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `input()` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a` is less than half of `b`, and the product of `a` and `n` is being printed, where `a` is an integer between 1 and 30 and `n` is an odd integer between 1 and 100**
