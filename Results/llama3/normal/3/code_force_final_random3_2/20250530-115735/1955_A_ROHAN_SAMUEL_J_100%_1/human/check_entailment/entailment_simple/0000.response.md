Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts based on the prices a and b.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If n is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it prints the total cost of buying n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b) plus the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (a).

2. If n is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it prints the total cost of buying n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b).

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the minimum cost of buying n yogurts based on the given prices.

Correctness: **True**
