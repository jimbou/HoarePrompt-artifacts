Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for a lower price.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).
3. If the number of yogurts (n) is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost as the number of yogurts multiplied by the price of one yogurt (a * n). Otherwise, it prints the total cost as the number of pairs of yogurts multiplied by the promotion price (n // 2 * b) plus the price of one yogurt (a).
4. If the number of yogurts (n) is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost as the number of yogurts multiplied by the price of one yogurt (a * n). Otherwise, it prints the total cost as the number of pairs of yogurts multiplied by the promotion price (n // 2 * b).

The program correctly handles the different scenarios and calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
