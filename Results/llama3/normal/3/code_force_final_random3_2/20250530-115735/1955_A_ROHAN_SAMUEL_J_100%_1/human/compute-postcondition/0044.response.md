Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b` are integers greater than 1, stdin contains no input. If `n` is odd, then if 2 times `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a` is printed. If `n` is even, then if 2 * `a` is less than `b`, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of `n // 2 * b` is printed.***
