Postcondition: ***_ is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), `input()` must be greater than 0. If `n` is odd and 2 * a is less than b, the product of `a` and `n` is printed. If `n` is odd and 2 * a is not less than b, the product of the integer division of n by 2 and b plus a is printed. If `n` is even and 2a is less than b, the product of a and n is printed. If `n` is even and 2a is larger than or equal to b, the product of the integer division of n by 2 and b is printed.***
