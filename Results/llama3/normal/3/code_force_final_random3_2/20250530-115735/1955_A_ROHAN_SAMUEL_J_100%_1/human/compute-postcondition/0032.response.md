The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `input()`. If `input()` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `input()` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `input()` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `a` is between 1 and 30, `b` is between 1 and 30, `input()` is greater than 1**
