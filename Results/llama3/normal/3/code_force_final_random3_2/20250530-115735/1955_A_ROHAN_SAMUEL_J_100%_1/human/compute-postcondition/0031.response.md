Postcondition: **The program processes input lines containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is between 1 and 100, and `a` and `b` are between 1 and 30. If `n` is odd, it checks if `2 * a` is less than `b`. If true, it prints the product of `a` and `n`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even, it also checks if `2 * a` is less than `b`. If true, it prints the product of `a` and `n`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `n // 2 * b`. After processing, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned to the values from the next line of input, and the process repeats until all input lines are processed.**
