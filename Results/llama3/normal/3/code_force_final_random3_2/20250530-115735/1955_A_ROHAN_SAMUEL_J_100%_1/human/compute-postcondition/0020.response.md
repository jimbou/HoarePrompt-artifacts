Output State: **_ is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned to the values from the next line of input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values read from the next line of input, which contains three integers separated by spaces. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged, except that one line has been consumed from stdin.
