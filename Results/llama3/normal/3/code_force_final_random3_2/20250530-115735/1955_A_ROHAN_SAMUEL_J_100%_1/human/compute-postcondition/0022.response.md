Output: **_ is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned to the values from the next line of input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), and the product of `a` and `n` is being printed, where `a` is an integer between 1 and 30 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100**
