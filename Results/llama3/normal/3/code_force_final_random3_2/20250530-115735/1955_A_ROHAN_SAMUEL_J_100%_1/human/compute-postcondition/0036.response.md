The code prints the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`. 

Here, `n // 2` means the integer division of `n` by 2 (i.e., the largest whole number less than or equal to `n/2`), `b` is multiplied with the result, and then `a` is added to it.

Since `n` is greater than 1, `n // 2` will be at least 1 (because `n` is an integer). Since `a` and `b` are also greater than 1, the result of the expression will be at least 3 (1 * 1 + 1).

However, without knowing the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, we cannot determine the exact result of the expression.

Output: **at least 3 (where the actual value depends on the values of n, a, and b)**
