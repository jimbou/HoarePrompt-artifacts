The code calculates and prints the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. The formula used is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input, and the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b` is being printed**
