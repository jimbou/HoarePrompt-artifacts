The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, and stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is larger than `a`, then if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, an integer which is at least (2 * a + n + 1) * n // 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term `a` and common difference 1, and last term `b` is printed.**
