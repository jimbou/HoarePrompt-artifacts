Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b` is printed.***
