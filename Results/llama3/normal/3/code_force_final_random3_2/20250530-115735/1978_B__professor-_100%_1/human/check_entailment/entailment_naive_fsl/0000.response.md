Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. It handles three different cases:

1. If the modified price (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it simply sells all buns at the usual price, resulting in a profit of n * a.

2. If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (b - a) is greater than or equal to the number of buns (n), it calculates the profit by summing up the modified prices for the first n buns, which is equivalent to the sum of an arithmetic series.

3. If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (b - a) is less than the number of buns (n), it calculates the profit by summing up the modified prices for the first (b - a) buns and then selling the remaining buns at the usual price.

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output for the given examples. After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
