The code prints the calculated value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `2 * b`: This expression multiplies the value of `b` by 2. Since `b` is an integer, the result is also an integer.
* `- n + 1`: This expression subtracts the value of `n` from the result of the previous step and then adds 1. Since `n` is an integer, the result is also an integer.
* `* n`: This expression multiplies the result of the previous step by the value of `n`. Since both operands are integers, the result is also an integer.
* `// 2`: This expression performs integer division of the result of the previous step by 2. Since the result is an integer, the division is performed using integer division rules, which means any fractional part is truncated.

Based on the precondition, we know that `b` is larger than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`. However, we don't have explicit values for `b`, `n`, or `a`, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Therefore, the output will be an integer value that represents the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, where `b` and `n` are integers that satisfy the given conditions.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 (where b and n are integers that satisfy the given conditions)**
