Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers: a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if b <= a:
        print(n * a)
    elif b - a >= n:
        print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))
    else:
        print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is larger than `a`, then if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, an integer which is at least (2 * a + n + 1) * n // 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term `a` and common difference 1, and last term `b` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed, which is an integer representing the result of the calculation using the values of `n` and `b`. Otherwise, the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term `a` and last term `b` is printed, which is equal to `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a`, then if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the integer value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed. Otherwise, the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
