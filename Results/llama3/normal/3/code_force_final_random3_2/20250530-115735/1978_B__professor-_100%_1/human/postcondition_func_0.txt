The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. It then calculates and prints the result for each test case based on the values of a and b relative to n. The function handles three scenarios: (1) b is less than or equal to a, (2) b minus a is greater than or equal to n, and (3) b minus a is less than n. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.
