The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer.
Since `b` is larger than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, we can conclude that `b` is at least `n + a`.
Therefore, the expression `(2 * b - n + 1)` is at least `(2 * (n + a) - n + 1)`, which simplifies to `(2 * a + n + 1)`.
The expression `(2 * a + n + 1) * n // 2` is then at least `(2 * a + n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer.
Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before. Additionally, `b` is larger than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, and this is printed: an integer which is at least (2 * a + n + 1) * n // 2**
