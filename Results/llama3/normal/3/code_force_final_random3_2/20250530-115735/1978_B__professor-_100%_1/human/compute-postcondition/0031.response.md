The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. 

The expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `b - a + 1` terms, starting from 1 and ending at `b - a`. This sum is then multiplied by `b - a` and divided by 2 (integer division).

The result of this expression is then added to `a * n`, which is the product of `a` and `n`.

The final result is converted to an integer using the `int()` function and printed.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **the sum of an arithmetic series with b - a + 1 terms, starting from a and ending at b, multiplied by the number of terms, plus the product of a and n (where a, b, and n are the values of the variables a, b, and n)**
