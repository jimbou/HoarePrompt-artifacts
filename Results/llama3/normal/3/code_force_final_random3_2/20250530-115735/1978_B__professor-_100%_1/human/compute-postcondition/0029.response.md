The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`, which is an integer value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `2 * b`: This expression multiplies the value of `b` by 2. Since `b` is an integer, the result is also an integer.
* `2 * b - n + 1`: This expression subtracts the value of `n` from the result of the previous step and then adds 1. Since both `n` and `b` are integers, the result is also an integer.
* `(2 * b - n + 1) * n`: This expression multiplies the result of the previous step by the value of `n`. Since both `n` and the result of the previous step are integers, the result is also an integer.
* `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`: This expression performs integer division of the result of the previous step by 2. Since the result of the previous step is an integer, the result of this expression is also an integer.

Therefore, the output is an integer value that represents the result of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 (where b and n are the values of the variables b and n)**
