The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^9. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. If `b` is greater than `a` and `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2` is printed, which is an integer representing the result of the calculation using the values of `n` and `b`. Otherwise, the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term `a` and last term `b` is printed, which is equal to `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`**
