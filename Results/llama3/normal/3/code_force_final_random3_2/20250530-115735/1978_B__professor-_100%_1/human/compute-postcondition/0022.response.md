Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input, and the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence with first term a and last term b is printed, which is equal to int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)**
