Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is `t`, and stdin contains no more test cases.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations specified by the initial value of `t`. The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` still hold integer values, but their specific values are not specified, as they are assigned new values in each iteration. The stdin input stream is empty, as all test cases have been processed.
