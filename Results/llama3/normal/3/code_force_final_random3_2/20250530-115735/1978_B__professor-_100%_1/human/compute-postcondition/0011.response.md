The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. The expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. The formula used is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series, which is given by `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers, the result of the expression will also be an integer. The value of the expression depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, which are not provided in the initial state.

However, based on the given conditions, we know that `b` is larger than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`. This means that the arithmetic series has a positive slope, and the sum of the series will be a positive integer.

Output: **the sum of the arithmetic series with n terms, where the first term is a and the last term is b, calculated using the formula (b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n**
