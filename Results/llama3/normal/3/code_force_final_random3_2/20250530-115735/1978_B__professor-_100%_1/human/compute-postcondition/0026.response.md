Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the next three integers from the input. The other variables, `t` and `_`, remain unchanged. The stdin now contains at least one fewer test case than before, as three integers have been read from the input.
