Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before. Additionally, `b` is larger than `a`, and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, and the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term `a` and common difference 1, and last term `b` is being printed**
