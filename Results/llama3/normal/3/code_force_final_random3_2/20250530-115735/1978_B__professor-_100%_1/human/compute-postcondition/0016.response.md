Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the next three integers from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains at least one fewer test case than before, as three integers have been read from the input.
