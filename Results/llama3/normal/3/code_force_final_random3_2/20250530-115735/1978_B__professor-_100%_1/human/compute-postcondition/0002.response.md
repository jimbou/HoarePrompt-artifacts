The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into three parts, and assigns the converted integers to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively.

In the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 0.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers read from the standard input. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not used in the code.

Since the code reads a line from the standard input, the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before.**
