Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 0, and stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before. Additionally, `b` is larger than `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then an integer which is at least (2 * a + n + 1) * n // 2 is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence with first term `a` and common difference 1, and last term `b` is printed.***
