Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^9, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers, `_` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 fewer test case than before, `n`, `a`, and `b` are assigned the values of the next three integers from the input, and the value of the expression (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2 is printed, which is an integer representing the result of the calculation using the values of `n` and `b`**
