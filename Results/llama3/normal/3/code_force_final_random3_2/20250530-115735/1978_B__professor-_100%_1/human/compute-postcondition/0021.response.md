The code prints the result of a mathematical expression involving the variables `a`, `b`, and `n`. 

The expression `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with `b - a + 1` terms, where the first term is `a` and the last term is `b`. This is equivalent to the sum of an arithmetic series with `n` terms, where the first term is `a` and the common difference is `1`.

The expression `a * n` calculates the sum of `n` terms, where each term is `a`.

The two expressions are added together, and the result is converted to an integer using the `int()` function.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the expression. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **the sum of an arithmetic series with n terms, where the first term is a and the common difference is 1, plus the sum of n terms, where each term is a (where a, b, and n are the values of a, b, and n)**
