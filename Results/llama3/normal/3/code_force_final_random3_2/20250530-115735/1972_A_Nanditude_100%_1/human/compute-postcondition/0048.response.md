The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j. If j is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is n-1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, j must be incremented by 1 and n must be greater than j. So j is n and n must be greater than n.
State: **_* is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 1 if the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], otherwise cnt is 0. If b[j] is less than a[i], i remains 0, otherwise i is incremented by 1. j is n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**
