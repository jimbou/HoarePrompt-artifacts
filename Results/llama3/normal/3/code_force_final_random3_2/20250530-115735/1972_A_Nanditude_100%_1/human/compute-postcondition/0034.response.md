Output State: **`_*_` is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer greater than 3, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 2 and j is 3. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and j is 3. i is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 and `j` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `j` is 3. The value of `i` is now either 1 or 2, depending on the previous value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
