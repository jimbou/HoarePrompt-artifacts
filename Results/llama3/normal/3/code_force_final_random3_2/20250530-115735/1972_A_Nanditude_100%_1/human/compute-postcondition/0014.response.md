Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `j` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one.
