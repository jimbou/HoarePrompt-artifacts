Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a (1 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ an ≤ 10^9), and the third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b (1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ bn ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with three lines of input: a positive integer `n`, a list of non-decreasing integers `a`, and a list of non-decreasing integers `b`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code and remain the same as in the initial state.
