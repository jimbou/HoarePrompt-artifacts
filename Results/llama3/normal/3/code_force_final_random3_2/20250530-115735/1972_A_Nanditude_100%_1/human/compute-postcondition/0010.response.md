Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `cnt` is 2 if the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2 if the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
