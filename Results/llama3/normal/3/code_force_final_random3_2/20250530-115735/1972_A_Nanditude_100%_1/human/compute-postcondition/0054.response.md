Output State: **_*_ is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is either 1 or 2, i is either 1 or 2, j is n+1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it can be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
