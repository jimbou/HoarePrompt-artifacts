Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.***
