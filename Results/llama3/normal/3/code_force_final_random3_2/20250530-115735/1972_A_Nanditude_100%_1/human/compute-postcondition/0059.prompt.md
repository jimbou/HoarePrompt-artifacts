Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a (1 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ an ≤ 10^9), and the third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b (1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ bn ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is the number of elements in b that are less than the corresponding elements in a, i is the index of the last element in a that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in b, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the number of elements in b that are less than the corresponding elements in a, which is cnt, is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a, i is the number of elements in a that are greater than or equal to the first element in b, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and cnt (the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, i is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, j is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and cnt is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
