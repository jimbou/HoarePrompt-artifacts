Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and two lists of n non-decreasing integers a and b. It then calculates the number of elements in list b that are less than the corresponding elements in list a and prints this count for each test case. The function does not modify the input lists or any other external state, and it does not return any value.**
