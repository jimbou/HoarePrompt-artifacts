Output State: **_* is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 0, i is 1, j is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and b[j] is not less than a[i].*

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]` is still valid because the value of `j` and the lists `a` and `b` have not changed.
