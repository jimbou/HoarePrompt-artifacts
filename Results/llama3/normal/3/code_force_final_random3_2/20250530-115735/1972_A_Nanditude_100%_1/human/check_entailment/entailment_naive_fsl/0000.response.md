Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the expected difficulties `b` and the actual difficulties `a`, and increments the count `cnt` whenever it encounters an actual difficulty that exceeds the expected difficulty. This count represents the minimum number of new problems needed to make the actual difficulties less than or equal to the expected difficulties.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the actual difficulties are already less than or equal to the expected difficulties, or where the expected difficulties are in non-decreasing order.

The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
