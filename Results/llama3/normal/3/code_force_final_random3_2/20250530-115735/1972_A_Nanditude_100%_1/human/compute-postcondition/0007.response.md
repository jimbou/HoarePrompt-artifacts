Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `cnt` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. Additionally, `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, i.e., `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `a[i]` and `b[j]` is still maintained, where `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.
