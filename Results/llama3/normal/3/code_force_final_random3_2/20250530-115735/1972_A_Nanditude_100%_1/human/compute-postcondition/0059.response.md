Output State: **_ is t, t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, i is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, j is 0, and stdin contains no more test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The input state remains unchanged, with `n` being a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` and `b` being lists of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. The variable `cnt` holds the total count of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` across all test cases, and `i` holds the index of the last element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `b` for the last test case. The loop has consumed all test cases from the input, leaving no more test cases in the input stream.
