Output State: **_* is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 2 if the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], otherwise cnt is 1. If b[j] is less than a[i], i remains 0, otherwise i is incremented by 1. j is n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of cnt has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of cnt is now 2 if the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables are the same as before. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three.
