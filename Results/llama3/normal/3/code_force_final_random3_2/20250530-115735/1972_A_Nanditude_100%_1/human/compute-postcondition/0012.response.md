Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `i` is increased by 1. `j` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.***
