Output State: **_* is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer greater than 2, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 1 and j is 2. Otherwise, cnt is 0 and j is 2. In both cases, i is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one._**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of i has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list a and list b are still lists of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. The value of j is still 2. The value of cnt depends on the comparison between the current value of b[j] and the current value of a[i]. If b[j] is less than a[i], then cnt is 1. Otherwise, cnt is 0. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed.
