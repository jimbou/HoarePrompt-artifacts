Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `cnt` is 1 if the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The lists `a` and `b` still contain non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, and the value of `cnt` is still dependent on the comparison between the current values of `a[i]` and `b[j]`. The input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one.
