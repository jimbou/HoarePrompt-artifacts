Postcondition: ***_ is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 0, i is 0, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i].***
