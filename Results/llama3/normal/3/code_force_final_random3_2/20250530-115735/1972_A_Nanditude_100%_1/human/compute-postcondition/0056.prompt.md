Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 0, i is 0, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if b[j] < a[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 1 if the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], otherwise cnt is 0. If b[j] is less than a[i], i remains 0, otherwise i is incremented by 1. j remains n-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *_* is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 2 and i remains 0. Otherwise, cnt is 1 and i is incremented by 1. j is n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program executes with the given preconditions. After the if-else block, the following conditions are met: `t` remains a positive integer greater than 2, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` and `b` remain lists of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. The value of `cnt` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is either 0, 1, or 2. The value of `j` remains `n+1`, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by two. The specific values of `cnt` and `i` depend on the comparison between `b[j]` and `a[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
