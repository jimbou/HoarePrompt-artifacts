The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` was 0. So, the new value of `i` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: *_ is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 0, i is 1, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and b[j] is not less than a[i].

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`.**
