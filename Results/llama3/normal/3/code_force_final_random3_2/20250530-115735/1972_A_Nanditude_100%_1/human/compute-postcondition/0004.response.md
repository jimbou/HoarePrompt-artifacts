Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**
