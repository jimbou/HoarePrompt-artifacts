Postcondition: ***`_*_` is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer greater than 3, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 3, i is 0, and j is 3. Otherwise, if i is 1, cnt is 1 and j is 3. If i is 2, cnt is 0 and j is 3.***
