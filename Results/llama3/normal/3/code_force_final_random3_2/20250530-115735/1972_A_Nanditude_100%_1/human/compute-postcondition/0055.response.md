Postcondition: ***The program executes with the given preconditions. After the if-else block, the following conditions are met: `t` remains a positive integer greater than 2, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` and `b` remain lists of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. The value of `cnt` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `i` is either 0, 1, or 2. The value of `j` remains `n+1`, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by two. The specific values of `cnt` and `i` depend on the comparison between `b[j]` and `a[i]`.***
