The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`_` is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is the number of elements in b that are less than the corresponding elements in a, i is the index of the last element in a that is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in b, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the number of elements in b that are less than the corresponding elements in a, which is cnt, is being printed**
