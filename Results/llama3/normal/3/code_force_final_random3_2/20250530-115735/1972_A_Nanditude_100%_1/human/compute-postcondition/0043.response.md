Output State: **_ is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 1, i is 0, j is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. The current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the variable cnt has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The variable _ is still 2, t is still a positive integer greater than 2, n is still a positive integer between 1 and 100, a and b are still lists of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, i is still 0, j is still n-1, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three. Additionally, the current value of b[j] is still less than the current value of a[i].
