Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads three lines from stdin for each test case. The first line assigns the value of the input to `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The second line assigns a list of `n` non-decreasing integers to `a`, and the third line assigns a list of `n` non-decreasing integers to `b`. The variables `cnt` and `i` are initialized to 0. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. After executing the code, stdin contains one less test case.
