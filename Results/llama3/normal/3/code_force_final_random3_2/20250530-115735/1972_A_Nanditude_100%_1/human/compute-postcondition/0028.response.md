The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **_* is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer greater than 2, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 1, i is 0, and j is 2. Otherwise, cnt is 0, i is 1, and j is 2. In both cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one._**
