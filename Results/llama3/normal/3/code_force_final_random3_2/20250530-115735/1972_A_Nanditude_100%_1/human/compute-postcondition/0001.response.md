The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a (1 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ an ≤ 10^9), and the third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b (1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ bn ≤ 10^9).**
