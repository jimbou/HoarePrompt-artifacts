Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a (1 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ an ≤ 10^9), and the third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b (1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ bn ≤ 10^9).**
