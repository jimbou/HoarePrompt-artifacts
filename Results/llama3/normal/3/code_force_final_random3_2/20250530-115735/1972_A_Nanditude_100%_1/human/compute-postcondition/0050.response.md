Output State: **_* is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 1 if the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], otherwise cnt is 0. If b[j] is less than a[i], i remains 0, otherwise i is incremented by 1. j is n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is incremented by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of i is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of i is now either 0 or 1 depending on whether b[j] is less than a[i] or not. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same.
