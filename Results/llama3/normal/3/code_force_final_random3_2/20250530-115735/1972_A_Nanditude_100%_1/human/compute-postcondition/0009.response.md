The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `cnt` is 1 if the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**
