Output State: **_ is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is 1, i is 0, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i].**

The code increments the value of cnt by 1. The initial value of cnt was 0, so after the increment, cnt becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i] is still valid after the code has been executed.
