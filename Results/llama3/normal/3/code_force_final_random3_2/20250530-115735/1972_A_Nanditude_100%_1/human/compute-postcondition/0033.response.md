Output State: **`_*_` is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer greater than 3, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 3, i is 0, and j is 3. Otherwise, cnt is 1, i is 1, and j is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`, then `cnt` is now 3, and `i` and `j` remain 0 and 3, respectively. Otherwise, `cnt` is now 1, and `i` and `j` remain 1 and 3, respectively. The values of the other variables, including `_*_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, remain unchanged.
