The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
