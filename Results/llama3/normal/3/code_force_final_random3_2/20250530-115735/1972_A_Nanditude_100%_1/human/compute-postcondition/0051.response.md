Postcondition: ***_* is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 2 and i remains 0. Otherwise, cnt is 1 and i is incremented by 1. j is n, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.***
