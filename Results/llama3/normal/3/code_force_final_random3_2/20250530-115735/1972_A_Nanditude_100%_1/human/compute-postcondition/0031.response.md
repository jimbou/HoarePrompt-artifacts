Postcondition: ***_* is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer greater than 2, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 2, i is 0, and j is 2. Otherwise, cnt is 0, i is 1, and j is 2. In both cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.***
