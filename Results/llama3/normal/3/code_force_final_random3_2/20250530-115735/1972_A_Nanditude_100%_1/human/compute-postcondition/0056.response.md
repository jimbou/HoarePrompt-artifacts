Output State: **_ is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, i is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, j is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` as in the initial state. The value of `cnt` will be a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`, representing the total number of times `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` during the loop iterations. The value of `i` will be a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`, representing the final index in the list `a` after the loop iterations. The value of `j` will be 0, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `b`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains reduced by three.
