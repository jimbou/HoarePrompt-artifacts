Output State: **_*_ is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is either 2 or 3, i is either 0 or 1, j is n+1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 3. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
