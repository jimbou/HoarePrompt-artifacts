The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **_ is 2, t is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, cnt is the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a, i is the number of elements in a that are greater than or equal to the first element in b, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and cnt (the number of elements in b that are less than the first element in a) is being printed**
