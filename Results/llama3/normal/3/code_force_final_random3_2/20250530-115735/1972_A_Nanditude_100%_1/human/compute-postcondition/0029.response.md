Output State: **_* is 1, t is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer greater than 2, a is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9, b is a list of n non-decreasing integers between 1 and 10^9. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt is 2, i is 0, and j is 2. Otherwise, cnt is 1, i is 1, and j is 2. In both cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one._**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of cnt is incremented by 1. If the current value of b[j] is less than the current value of a[i], then cnt becomes 2, i remains 0, and j remains 2. Otherwise, cnt becomes 1, i remains 1, and j remains 2. The values of other variables and the number of test cases in stdin remain unchanged.
