Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated to the integers input by the user, and the stdin is empty since the input has been consumed. The other variables `_` and `t` retain their original values.
