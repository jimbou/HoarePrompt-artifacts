Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (one less than initially)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1` plus the sum of `x` times the integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1), `i` is `x`. If the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `x+1` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `i` by `k-1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
