Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It then checks the value of x in relation to k and prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to a calculated value based on x and k, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The calculated value is x+1 if x is less than k-1, x+3 if x equals k-1, or a more complex calculation involving the sum of integer divisions if x is greater than k-1. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
