Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` to integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Since the stdin contains a space-separated list of integers, after the code is executed, the stdin is empty.
