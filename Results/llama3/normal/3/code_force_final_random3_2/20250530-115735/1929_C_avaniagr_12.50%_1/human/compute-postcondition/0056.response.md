Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is 3 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 2, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to be 3 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, which is a more specific expression than its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.
