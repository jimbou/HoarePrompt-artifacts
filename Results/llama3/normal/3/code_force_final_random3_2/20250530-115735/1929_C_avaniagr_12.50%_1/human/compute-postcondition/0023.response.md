Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers. `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 1, which is the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` where `z` was initially 0 and `k` is an integer greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
