Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `x+1` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `i` by `k-1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, and if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
