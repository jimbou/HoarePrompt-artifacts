Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x` is greater than 1, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is 4 plus the integer division of 2 by `k-1`, `i` is 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

The value of `z` is updated by adding the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `z` is initially 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, the new value of `z` is 4 plus the integer division of 2 by `k-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
