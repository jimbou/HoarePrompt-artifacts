To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 0, because the range function in Python includes 0. So, we can adjust the state of `x` to be at least 0. The state of `i` can be adjusted to be 0, because it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x` is at least 0, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**
