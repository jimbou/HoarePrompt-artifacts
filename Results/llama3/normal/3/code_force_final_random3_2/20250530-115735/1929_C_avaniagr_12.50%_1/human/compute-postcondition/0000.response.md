The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer is read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (one less than initially)**
