Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `a` are integers, `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is `x + 1` plus the sum of `x` times the integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1), `i` is `x`. If the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
