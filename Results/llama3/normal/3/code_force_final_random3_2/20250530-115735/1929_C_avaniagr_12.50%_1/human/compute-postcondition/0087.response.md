Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is `x+1` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `i` by `k-1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` remains 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain integers assigned values from the input, `z` becomes `x+1` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `i` by `k-1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, and `i` becomes `x`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
