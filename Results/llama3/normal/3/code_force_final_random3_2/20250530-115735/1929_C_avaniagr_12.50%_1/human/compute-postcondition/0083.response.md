To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is at least 0.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x` is greater than 0, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**
