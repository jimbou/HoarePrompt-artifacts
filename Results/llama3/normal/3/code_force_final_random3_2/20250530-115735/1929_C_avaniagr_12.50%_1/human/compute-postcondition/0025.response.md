Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `a` are integers, `x` is larger than or equal to 1, `x` is not equal to 0, `z` is 2 plus the integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1), `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1). The integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1) is equivalent to `z // (k - 1)`. The value of `z` is now 2 plus this result. All other variables remain unchanged.
