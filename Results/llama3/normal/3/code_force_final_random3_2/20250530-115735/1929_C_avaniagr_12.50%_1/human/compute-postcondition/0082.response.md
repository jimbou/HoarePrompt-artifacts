Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x` is at least 0, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 1, which is the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` where `z` is initially 0 and `k` is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
