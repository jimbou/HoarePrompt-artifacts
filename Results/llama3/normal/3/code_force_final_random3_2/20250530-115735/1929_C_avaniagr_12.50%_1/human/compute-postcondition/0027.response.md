Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `a` are integers, `x` is larger than or equal to 1, `x` is not equal to 0, `z` is 3 plus 2 times the integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1), `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to be 3 plus 2 times the integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1), while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
