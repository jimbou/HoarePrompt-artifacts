Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is `x+1` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `i` by `k-1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.***
