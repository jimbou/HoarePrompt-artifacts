To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**
