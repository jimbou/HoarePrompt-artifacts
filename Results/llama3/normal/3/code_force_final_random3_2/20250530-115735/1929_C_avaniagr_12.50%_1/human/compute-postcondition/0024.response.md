The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `a` are integers, `x` is larger than or equal to 1, `x` is not equal to 0, `z` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1**
