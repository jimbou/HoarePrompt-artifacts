Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 29 (inclusive), `_` is equal to `t`, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `x+1` plus the sum of the integer divisions of `i` by `k-1` for `i` from 0 to `x`, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `t` is now between 0 and 29 (inclusive). The variable `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` have been assigned values from the input. The standard input is empty. The loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
