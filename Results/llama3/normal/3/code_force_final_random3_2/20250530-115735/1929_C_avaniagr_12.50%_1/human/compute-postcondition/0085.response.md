The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x` is greater than 1, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `i` is 2, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**
