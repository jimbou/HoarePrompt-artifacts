Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `x+1` plus `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, otherwise 'NO' is printed.***
