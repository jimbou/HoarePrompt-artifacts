Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 30 (inclusive), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `a` are integers, `x` is larger than or equal to `k - 1`, and `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is `x + 1` plus the sum of `x` times the integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1), `i` is `x`.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `a` remain unchanged, and `x` is still larger than or equal to `k - 1` and not equal to `k - 1`. The value of `z` is now `x + 1` plus the sum of `x` times the integer division of `z` by (`k` - 1), which represents the cumulative effect of the loop's iterations on `z`. The value of `i` is now `x`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
