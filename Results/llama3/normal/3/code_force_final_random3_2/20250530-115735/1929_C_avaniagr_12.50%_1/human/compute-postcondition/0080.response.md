Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `k`, `x`, `a` are integers assigned values from the input, `z` is 0, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `t` is still an integer between 1 and 29 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is still 2, and `k`, `x`, `a` are still integers assigned values from the input. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
