Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

6
2 2 3 3 3 3

The program will output 1, but the correct output is 2. The program is only counting the number of sets of 4 sticks of the same length, but it is not considering the possibility of forming polygons with fewer sides.

In this case, we can form a square with the 4 sticks of length 3, and a triangle with the 3 sticks of length 2. Therefore, the correct output should be 2.

The program needs to be modified to consider all possible polygon formations, not just those with 4 sides.
