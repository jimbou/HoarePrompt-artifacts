Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is `ans` + `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a` and must have at least 1 value, `x` is the first value in the dictionary `cnt`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding the integer division of `x` by 4 to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
