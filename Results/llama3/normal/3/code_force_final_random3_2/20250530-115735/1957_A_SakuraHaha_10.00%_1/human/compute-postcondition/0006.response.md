Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `a` and the value is 1, and the key is the second integer in the list `a` and the value is increased by 1, and the key is the third integer in the list `a` and the value is increased by 1, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[x]` has been increased by 1, where `x` is the third integer in the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for the test cases.
