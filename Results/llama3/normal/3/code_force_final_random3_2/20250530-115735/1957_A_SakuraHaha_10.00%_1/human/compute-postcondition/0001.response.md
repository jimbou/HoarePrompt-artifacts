To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `x` and the list `a`. 

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` must be greater than 0. 

At the start of the loop, `x` will take the value of the first element in `a`.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `x` is the first integer in the list `a`**
