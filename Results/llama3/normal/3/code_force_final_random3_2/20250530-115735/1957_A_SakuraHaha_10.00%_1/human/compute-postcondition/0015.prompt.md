Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, `x` is the last integer in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 4


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is `ans` + `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a` and must have at least 1 value, `x` is the first value in the dictionary `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is `ans` + `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a` and must have at least 2 values, `x` is the second value in the dictionary `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is `ans` + `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a` and must have at least 3 values, `x` is the third value in the dictionary `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
