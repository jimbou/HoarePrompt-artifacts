Output State: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is `ans` + `x // 4` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, `x` is the last value in the dictionary `cnt`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each count in the `cnt` dictionary by 4, and the value of `x` is the last count in the `cnt` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
