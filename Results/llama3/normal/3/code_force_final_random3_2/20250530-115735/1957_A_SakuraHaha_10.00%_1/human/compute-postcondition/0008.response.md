Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, `x` is the last integer in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the input `a` is fully processed, and the dictionary `cnt` contains the count of each integer in the list `a`. The loop has iterated over all elements in `a`, and `x` holds the last element of `a`. The other variables, `n` and `ans`, remain unchanged.
