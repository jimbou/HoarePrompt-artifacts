Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is `ans` + `x // 4`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a` and must have at least 2 values, `x` is the second value in the dictionary `cnt`.**

The value of `ans` is increased by `x // 4`, where `x` is the second value in the dictionary `cnt`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
