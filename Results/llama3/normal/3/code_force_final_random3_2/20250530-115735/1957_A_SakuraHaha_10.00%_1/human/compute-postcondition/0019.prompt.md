You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. All integers are non-negative and less than or equal to 100.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, `x` is the last integer in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: Output State: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is `ans` + `x // 4` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, `x` is the last value in the dictionary `cnt`.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each count in the `cnt` dictionary by 4, and the value of `x` is the last count in the `cnt` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: The sum of the integer division of each count in the `cnt` dictionary by 4

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
