Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for x in a:
    cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `a` and the value is 1, `x` is the first integer in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `a` and the value is 1, and the key is the second integer in the list `a` and the value is increased by 1, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `a` and the value is 1, and the key is the second integer in the list `a` and the value is increased by 1, and the key is the third integer in the list `a` and the value is increased by 1, `x` is the third integer in the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
