Output State: **stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers. n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary.**

The code snippet reads an integer t from stdin, then for each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers. The value of n is stored in the variable n, and the list of integers is stored in the variable a. The variable ans is initialized to 0, and the variable cnt is initialized as an empty dictionary. The stdin now contains t-1 integers, each followed by a list of n integers.
