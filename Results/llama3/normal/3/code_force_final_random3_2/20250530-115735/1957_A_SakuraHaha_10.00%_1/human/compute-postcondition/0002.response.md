Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple inputs: first an integer t-1, then for each test case, first an integer n and then a list of n integers, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where the key is the first integer in the list `a` and the value is 1, `x` is the first integer in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the code has updated the `cnt` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `a` (which is `x`) and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains multiple inputs as before, but the `cnt` dictionary now has a new entry.
