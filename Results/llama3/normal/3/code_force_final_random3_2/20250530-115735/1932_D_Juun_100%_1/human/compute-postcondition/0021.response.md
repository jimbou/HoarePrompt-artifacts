The code appends the rank of the third card to the list of trumps. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list of trumps now contains the rank of the first card, the rank of the second card if the suit of the second card is also the trump suit, or the rank of the first card if the suit of the second card is not the trump suit, or the rank of the first card and the rank of the third card if the suit of the first card is not the trump suit.
