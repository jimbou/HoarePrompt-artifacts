Output State: **trumps is a list containing the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, answers is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `trumps` contains the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, the list `answers` contains strings that represent the comparison of the ranks of cards with the same suit, and the dictionary `suits` has all its values reset to `None`.
