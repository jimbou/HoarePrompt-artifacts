Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, but with one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, with one additional string that is the concatenation of the current rank and suit, followed by the last rank that was in `trumps` and the first key in the `suits` dictionary, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `suit` is the second key in the dictionary and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop, meaning that the current iteration is skipped and the next one is executed. The values of the variables remain the same, but the loop continues with the next iteration.
