stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character representing the trump suit (one of "CDHS"), and a space-separated list of 2n cards, where each card is a two-character string (the first character is the rank of the card, one of "23456789", and the second character is the suit of the card, one of "CDHS"). All cards are different.
