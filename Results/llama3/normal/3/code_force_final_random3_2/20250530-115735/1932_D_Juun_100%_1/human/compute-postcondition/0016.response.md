Output State: **`stdin` contains at least one card, `trump` is a character representing the trump suit, `card` is the second card in the input, `rank` is the rank of the second card, `suit` is the suit of the second card. If the suit of the first card is the trump suit, then `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card, `answers` is an empty list, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None except for the suit of the second card which is the rank of the second card. If the suit of the first card is not the trump suit, then `trumps` is an empty list, and if the value of `suits[suit]` was not None, then `answers` is a list containing one string, the string is the concatenation of the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the first card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the first card, whichever is larger, and the value of `suits[suit]` is the rank of the second card. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list, and the value of `suits[suit]` is the rank of the second card.**

In natural language, the code updates the value of `suits[suit]` to be the rank of the second card. If the suit of the first card is the trump suit, the state of the variables remains the same except for the value of `suits[suit]`. If the suit of the first card is not the trump suit, the value of `suits[suit]` is updated to be the rank of the second card, and if the previous value of `suits[suit]` was not None, the list `answers` is updated to contain a string that compares the rank of the first card with the previous value of `suits[suit]`.
