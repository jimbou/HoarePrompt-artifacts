Output State: **`stdin` contains at least one card, `trump` is a character representing the trump suit, `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None, `card` is the first card in the input, `rank` is the rank of the first card, `suit` is the suit of the first card and the current value of `suit` is equal to `trump`.**

The code appends the rank of the first card to the `trumps` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `trumps` list now contains the rank of the first card, which is also the rank of the card that has a suit equal to the trump suit.
