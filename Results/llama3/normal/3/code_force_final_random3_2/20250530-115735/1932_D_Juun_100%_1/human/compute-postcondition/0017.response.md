Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains at least one card, `trump` is a character representing the trump suit, `card` is the second card in the input, `rank` is the rank of the second card, `suit` is the suit of the second card. If the suit of the first card is the trump suit, then `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card. If the suit of the first card is not the trump suit, then `trumps` is an empty list. If `suits[suit]` is not None, then `answers` is a list containing one string, the string is the concatenation of the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the first card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the first card, whichever is larger. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None except for the suit of the second card which is the rank of the second card.***
