Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: trumps is an empty list, answers is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, with four additional strings that are the concatenation of the current rank and suit, followed by the last rank that was in trumps and the first key in the suits dictionary, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 4 key-value pairs.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing strings that must have at least 1 answer, `answer` is the first answer in the list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 4 key-value pairs, and the first answer in the list which is [answer] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing strings that must have at least 2 answers, `answer` is the second answer in the list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 4 key-value pairs, and the second answer in the list `answers` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing strings that must have at least 3 answers, `answer` is the third answer in the list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 4 key-value pairs, and the third answer in the list `answers` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
