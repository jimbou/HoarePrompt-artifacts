Output State: **`trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, but with one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, with one additional string that is the concatenation of the current rank and suit, followed by the last rank that was in `trumps` and the first key in the `suits` dictionary, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `suit` is the third key in the dictionary, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, and `suit` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
