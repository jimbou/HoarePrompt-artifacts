Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: trumps is a list containing the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, answers is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: trumps is a list containing the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, but with one less element than before, answers is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, with one additional string that is the concatenation of the current rank and suit, followed by the last rank that was in trumps and the first key in the suits dictionary, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 1 key-value pair, suit is the first key in the dictionary. The current value of trumps is not empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, but with one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, with one additional string that is the concatenation of the current rank and suit, followed by the last rank that was in `trumps` and the first key in the `suits` dictionary, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 1 key-value pair, `suit` is the second key in the dictionary. If `rank` is None, we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`trumps` is a list containing the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, but with one less element than before, `answers` is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, with one additional string that is the concatenation of the current rank and suit, followed by the last rank that was in `trumps` and the first key in the `suits` dictionary, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `suit` is the third key in the dictionary. If `rank` is `None`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current values of `trumps`, `answers`, `suits`, and `suit`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
