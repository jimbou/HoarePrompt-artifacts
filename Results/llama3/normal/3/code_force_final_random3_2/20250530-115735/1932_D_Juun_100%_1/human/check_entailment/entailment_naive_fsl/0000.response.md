Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when there are multiple cards of the same suit that are not trump cards. In this case, the program will not be able to reconstruct the rounds correctly, as it will try to pair the cards of the same suit in the order they appear in the input, without considering the ranks of the cards.

For example, if the input is:

3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

The program will pair the cards as follows:

3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S

However, this is not a valid reconstruction of the rounds, as the 4C card can beat the 3C card, but the 6D card cannot beat the 9S card.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle the case when there are multiple cards of the same suit that are not trump cards. One possible solution is to sort the cards of each suit by their ranks before pairing them.
