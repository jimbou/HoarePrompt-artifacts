Output State: **trumps is an empty list, answers is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, with four additional strings that are the concatenation of the current rank and suit, followed by the last rank that was in trumps and the first key in the suits dictionary, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 4 key-value pairs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that trumps is an empty list, answers is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, with four additional strings that are the concatenation of the current rank and suit, followed by the last rank that was in trumps and the first key in the suits dictionary, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 4 key-value pairs.
