Output State: **The values of the variables do not change but we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration of the loop we were directly inside and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: trumps is a list containing the ranks of all cards with the trump suit, answers is a list containing strings, each string is the concatenation of the suit of a card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the card and the rank of the card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the card, whichever is larger, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values that must have at least 1 key-value pair, suit is the first key in the dictionary, and the current value of rank is None, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**
