Functionality: **This function processes a series of card game test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a trump suit and a list of cards. It then prints out the cards in a specific order, with the trump suit cards being printed first in descending order, followed by the non-trump suit cards in a specific pairing order. If there are not enough trump suit cards to pair with the non-trump suit cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly to the console.**
