Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, trump is a character representing the trump suit, trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None**.

The first line reads and discards the integer t from stdin, leaving t-1 test cases in stdin. The second line reads the trump suit from stdin and assigns it to the variable trump. The third and fourth lines initialize two empty lists, trumps and answers, respectively. The fifth line initializes a dictionary suits with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None.
