Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, trump is a character representing the trump suit, trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains at least one card, `trump` is a character representing the trump suit, `card` is the first card in the input, `rank` is the rank of the first card, `suit` is the suit of the first card. If the suit of the first card is the trump suit, then `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card, `answers` is an empty list, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None. If the suit of the first card is not the trump suit, then `trumps` is an empty list, and if the value of `suits[suit]` is not None, then `answers` is a list containing one string, the string is the concatenation of the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the first card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the first card, whichever is larger, and the value of `suits[suit]` is None. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list, and the value of `suits[suit]` is `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` contains at least one card, `trump` is a character representing the trump suit, `card` is the second card in the input, `rank` is the rank of the second card, `suit` is the suit of the second card. If the suit of the first card is the trump suit, then `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card and the rank of the second card if the suit of the second card is also the trump suit, otherwise `trumps` is a list containing the rank of the first card. If the suit of the first card is not the trump suit, then `trumps` is an empty list. If `suits[suit]` is not None, then `answers` is a list containing one string, the string is the concatenation of the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the first card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of `suits[suit]` and the rank of the first card, whichever is larger. Otherwise, `answers` is an empty list. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None except for the suit of the second card which is the rank of the second card if the suit of the second card is not the trump suit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains at least two cards, trump is a character representing the trump suit, card is the third card in the input, rank is the first character of the third card, suit is the second character of the third card, trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card, the rank of the second card if the suit of the second card is also the trump suit, or the rank of the first card if the suit of the second card is not the trump suit, or the rank of the first card and the rank of the third card if the suit of the first card is not the trump suit, answers is a list containing one or two strings, if suit is the trump suit, then answers contains one string, the string is the concatenation of the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the first card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the first card, whichever is larger, otherwise answers contains one or two strings, if suits[suit] is not None, then answers contains two strings, the first string is the concatenation of the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the first card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the first card, whichever is larger, the second string is the concatenation of the suit of the third card and the rank of the third card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the third card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the third card and the rank of the third card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the third card, whichever is larger, otherwise answers contains one string, the string is the concatenation of the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the first card, whichever is smaller, followed by the suit of the first card and the rank of the first card, or the value of suits[suit] and the rank of the first card, whichever is larger, or an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None except for the suit of the second card which is the rank of the second card if the suit of the second card is not the trump suit and the suit of the third card which is the rank of the third card if suits[suit] is None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
