Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make a and b greater than or equal to m, considering the cases where m is less than both a and b, less than a but greater than b, less than b but greater than a, or greater than or equal to either a or b. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.**
