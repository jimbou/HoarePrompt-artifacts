Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), `a`, `b`, `m` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the three integers read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers, since one line has been read and processed.
