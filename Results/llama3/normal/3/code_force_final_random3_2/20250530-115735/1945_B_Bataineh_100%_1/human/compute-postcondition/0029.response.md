Output: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), `a`, `b`, `m` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers, and this is printed: the integer division of `m` by `a` plus the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 2**
