Output: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers. Either `m` is larger or equal to `a` or `m` is larger or equal to `b`. Either `m` is larger or equal to `a` or `m` is smaller or equal to `b`. `m` is either less than or equal to `a` or `m` is larger or equal to `b`, and the integer division of `m` by `a` plus the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 2 is being printed**
