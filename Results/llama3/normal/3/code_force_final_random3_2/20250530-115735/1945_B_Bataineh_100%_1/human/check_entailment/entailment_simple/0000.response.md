Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it means that the fireworks from both installations will not be visible in the sky at the same time. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is 2 (one from each installation).

- If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, it means that the fireworks from the second installation will be visible in the sky for a longer time. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b`, because the fireworks from the second installation will be visible for `m // b` minutes.

- If `m` is greater than `a` but less than `b`, it means that the fireworks from the first installation will be visible in the sky for a longer time. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a`, because the fireworks from the first installation will be visible for `m // a` minutes.

- If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, it means that the fireworks from both installations will be visible in the sky for a longer time. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is the integer division of `m` by `a` plus the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 2, because the fireworks from both installations will be visible for `m // a` and `m // b` minutes respectively.

The program correctly handles all these cases and prints the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
