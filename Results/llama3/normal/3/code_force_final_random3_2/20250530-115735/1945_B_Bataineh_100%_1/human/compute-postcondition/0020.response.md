The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers. If `m` is less than `a` and `m` is less than `b`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b` is printed. If `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` is printed. Otherwise, if `m` is either less than or equal to `a` or `m` is larger or equal to `b`, then the integer division of `m` by `a` plus the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 2 is printed.**
