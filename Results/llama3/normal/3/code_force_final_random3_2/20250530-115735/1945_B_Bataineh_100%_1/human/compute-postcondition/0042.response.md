Output: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), `a`, `b`, `m` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers, and this is printed: m // a + m // b + 2 where m is the third integer from the input, a is the first integer from the input, and b is the second integer from the input**
