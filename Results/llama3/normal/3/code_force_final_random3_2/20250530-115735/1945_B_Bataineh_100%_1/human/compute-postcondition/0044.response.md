Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), `a`, `b`, `m` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b`, the program prints 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a`. Otherwise, the program prints the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b`, plus 2.***
