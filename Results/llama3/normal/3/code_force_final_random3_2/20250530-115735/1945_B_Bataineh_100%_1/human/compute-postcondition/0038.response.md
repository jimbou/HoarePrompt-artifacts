Output: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), `a`, `b`, `m` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers, and this is printed: 2 + integer division of `m` by `b`**
