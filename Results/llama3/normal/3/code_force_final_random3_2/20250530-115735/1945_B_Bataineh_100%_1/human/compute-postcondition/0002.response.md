Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the three integers from the first line of the input, which are within the range of 1 to 10^18. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each with three integers, as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
