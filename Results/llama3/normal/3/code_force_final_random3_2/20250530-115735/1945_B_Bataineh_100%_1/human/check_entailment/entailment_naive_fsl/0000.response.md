Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. It considers all possible cases:

- If the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) is less than both the frequency of launching for the first installation (a) and the second installation (b), then only 2 fireworks can be seen at the same time.

- If m is less than a but greater than b, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is 2 plus the number of fireworks launched from the second installation that are still visible (m // b).

- If m is less than b but greater than a, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is 2 plus the number of fireworks launched from the first installation that are still visible (m // a).

- If m is greater than or equal to both a and b, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen is the sum of the number of fireworks launched from the first installation that are still visible (m // a), the number of fireworks launched from the second installation that are still visible (m // b), and 2.

The program correctly handles all these cases and calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.
