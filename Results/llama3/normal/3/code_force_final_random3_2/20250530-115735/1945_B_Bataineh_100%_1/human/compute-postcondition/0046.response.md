Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), stdin contains 0 lines. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then the number 2 is printed. Otherwise, if `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `b` is printed. If `m` is greater than `a` and less than `b`, then 2 plus the integer division of `m` by `a` is printed. Otherwise, if `m` is either less than or equal to `a` or `m` is larger or equal to `b`, then the integer division of `m` by `a` plus the integer division of `m` by `b` plus 2 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be greater than or equal to 0, and the value of `i` will be equal to `t`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the last set of values read from the input. The program will have printed the results of the calculations for each set of input values, and there will be no more lines left in the input.
