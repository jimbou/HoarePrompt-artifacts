Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right - left + 1 is at least 2, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where arr[left] is small_element, arr[left + 1] is small_element + 1, ..., arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + mid - 1, arr[left + mid] is big_element, arr[left + mid + 1] is big_element - 1, ..., arr[left + mid + not_mid - 1] is big_element - not_mid + 1, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, ..., cliquess[left + mid - 1] is clique, cliquess[left + mid] is clique, cliquess[left + mid + 1] is clique, ..., cliquess[left + mid + not_mid - 1] is clique, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is at least 3, i is 2**

The code block modifies the values of `arr[left + mid + i]` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. The first line assigns the value of `big_element - i` to `arr[left + mid + i]`, and the second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Since `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid + i]` becomes `big_element - 2`, and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` remains `clique`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
