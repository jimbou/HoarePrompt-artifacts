Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem of partitioning a graph into the minimum number of cliques. The program first calculates the number of cliques required, which is the ceiling of the division of the number of vertices (n) by the given integer (k). It then assigns distinct integers to each vertex and partitions the graph into cliques.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques and initializes the arrays to store the assigned integers and clique assignments. The `make_array` function assigns the integers to the vertices in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n is less than or equal to k, and when k is greater than or equal to 2n. In these cases, the program assigns the integers in a way that results in a single clique.

The program also correctly handles the case when n is greater than k, and k is less than 2n. In this case, the program divides the vertices into cliques of size k, and assigns the integers in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem, and handles all the edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
