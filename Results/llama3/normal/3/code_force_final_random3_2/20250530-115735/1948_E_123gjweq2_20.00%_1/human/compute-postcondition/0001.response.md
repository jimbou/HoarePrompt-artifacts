To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the variable `mid`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `mid`. If `mid` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `mid` is calculated as `(right - left + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that `right - left + 1` is at least 2, so that `mid` is at least 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `left` and `right` to ensure that `right - left + 1` is at least 2.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `right - left + 1` is at least 2, `clique` is a non-negative integer, `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of non-negative integers with length at least `right + 1`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is at least 1, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2)`, `i` is 0**
