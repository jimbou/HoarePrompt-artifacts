Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right - left + 1 is at least 2, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where arr[left] is small_element, arr[left + 1] is small_element + 1, ..., arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + mid - 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, ..., cliquess[left + mid - 1] is clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2), i is mid**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `arr` and `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` have been updated according to the loop body, where `mid` is the number of iterations. The values of `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged, and `i` is equal to `mid`, indicating that the loop has executed `mid` times.
