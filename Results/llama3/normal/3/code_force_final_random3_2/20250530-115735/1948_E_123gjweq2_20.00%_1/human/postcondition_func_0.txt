The function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It calculates the ceiling of n/k and assigns it to the variable cliques. It then initializes two lists, arr and cliquess, of length n with all elements set to 0. The function then iterates over the range of cliques, calling the function make_array with arguments i*k, min((i+1)*k-1, n-1), and i+1. After the loop, the function prints the list arr, which contains the value cliques repeated cliques*k times followed by unknown elements. It then prints the value of cliques and finally prints the list cliquess, which contains all zeros. The function does not return any value.
