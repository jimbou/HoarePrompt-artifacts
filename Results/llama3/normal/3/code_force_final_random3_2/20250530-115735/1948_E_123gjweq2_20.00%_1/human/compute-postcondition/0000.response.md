Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr and cliquess are lists of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2)**

In this final state, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The new variables `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` are introduced and assigned values based on the initial values of `left` and `right`. The value of `small_element` is set to `left + 1`, and the value of `big_element` is set to `right + 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of `big_element - small_element` by 2, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. Finally, the value of `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`, which is equivalent to `right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2)`.
