Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right - left + 1 is at least 2, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where arr[left] is small_element, arr[left + 1] is small_element + 1, ..., arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + mid - 1, arr[left + mid] is big_element, arr[left + mid + 1] is big_element - 1, ..., arr[left + mid + not_mid - 1] is big_element - not_mid + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, ..., cliquess[left + mid - 1] is clique, cliquess[left + mid] is clique, cliquess[left + mid + 1] is clique, ..., cliquess[left + mid + not_mid - 1] is clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is 0, i is not_mid.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the array `arr` and the list `cliquess` have been modified according to the loop's body, but the values of the other variables in the precondition remain unchanged. The loop has iterated `not_mid` times, and the value of `i` is now equal to `not_mid`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
