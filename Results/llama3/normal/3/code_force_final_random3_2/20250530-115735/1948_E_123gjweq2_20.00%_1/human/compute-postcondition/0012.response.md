To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `not_mid` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

Since `not_mid` is greater than 1, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right - left + 1 is at least 2, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where arr[left] is small_element, arr[left + 1] is small_element + 1, ..., arr[left + mid - 1] is small_element + mid - 1, arr[left + mid] is big_element, arr[left + mid + 1] is big_element - 1, ..., arr[left + mid + not_mid - 1] is big_element - not_mid + 1, arr[left + mid + i] is big_element - i, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left] is clique, cliquess[left + 1] is clique, ..., cliquess[left + mid - 1] is clique, cliquess[left + mid] is clique, cliquess[left + mid + 1] is clique, ..., cliquess[left + mid + not_mid - 1] is clique, cliquess[left + mid + i] is clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is at least 3, i is 2**
