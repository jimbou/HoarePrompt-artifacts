The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `mid` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `mid` must be greater than 2.
State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right - left + 1 is at least 2, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where arr[left] is small_element, arr[left + 1] is small_element + 1, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left] is clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2), i is 2**
