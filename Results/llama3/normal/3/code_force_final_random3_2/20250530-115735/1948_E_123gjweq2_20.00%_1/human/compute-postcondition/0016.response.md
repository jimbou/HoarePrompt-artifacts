Functionality: **The function modifies two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, by assigning values to a subset of their elements. It takes a range defined by `left` and `right` indices and a `clique` value as input. The function first calculates the midpoint of the range and then assigns incrementing values starting from `left + 1` to the first half of the range in `arr`, and the value of `clique` to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. It then assigns decrementing values starting from `right + 1` to the second half of the range in `arr`, and the value of `clique` to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. The function does not return any value, but modifies the input lists in place.**
