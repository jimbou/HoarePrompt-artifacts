Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right - left + 1 is at least 2, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where arr[left] is small_element, arr[left + 1] is small_element + 1, arr[left + 2] is small_element + 2, arr[left + 3] is small_element + 3, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left] is clique, cliquess[left + 2] is clique, cliquess[left + 3] is clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 3, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2), i is 3.**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `arr[left + i]` and `cliquess[left + i]`. The value of `arr[left + i]` is now `small_element + i`, which is `left + 1 + 3`, and the value of `cliquess[left + i]` is now `clique`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
