Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that right - left + 1 is at least 2, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where arr[left] is small_element, arr[left + 1] is small_element + 1, arr[left + 2] is small_element + 2, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where cliquess[left] is clique, cliquess[left + 2] is clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is greater than 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2), i is 2.**

The code modifies the values of `arr[left + i]` and `cliquess[left + i]`. Since `i` is 2, `left + i` is `left + 2`. The first line assigns the value of `small_element + i` to `arr[left + i]`, making `arr[left + 2]` equal to `small_element + 2`. The second line assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`, making `cliquess[left + 2]` equal to `clique`. No other variables are affected.
