To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid):`, so we can only adjust the state of `i` and `not_mid`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `not_mid` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `not_mid` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `right - left + 1` is at least 2, `clique` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with length at least `right + 1` where `arr[left]` is `small_element`, `arr[left + 1]` is `small_element + 1`, ..., `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `small_element + mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid]` is `big_element`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is `big_element - 1`, ..., `arr[left + mid + not_mid - 1]` is `big_element - not_mid + 1`, `cliquess` is a list of non-negative integers with length at least `right + 1` where `cliquess[left]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, ..., `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + mid]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is `clique`, ..., `cliquess[left + mid + not_mid - 1]` is `clique`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
