Functionality: This function modifies two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, within a specified range defined by the input parameters `left` and `right`. It assigns a sequence of increasing integers to the first half of the range in `arr`, starting from `left + 1`, and assigns a constant value `clique` to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. Then, it assigns a sequence of decreasing integers to the second half of the range in `arr`, starting from `right + 1`, and assigns the same constant value `clique` to the corresponding indices in `cliquess`. The function does not return any value.
