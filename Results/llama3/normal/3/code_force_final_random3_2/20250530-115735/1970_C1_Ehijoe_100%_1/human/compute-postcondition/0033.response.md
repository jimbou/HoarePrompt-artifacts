The only variable in the loop head is variable curr, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable curr.  If curr is not equal to e, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, curr is not equal to e, So for the loop to be executed one more time curr must not be equal to e.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least `n-1` key-value pairs, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `s` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `e` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `prev` and `curr` are values in `nodes` such that `curr` is not equal to `e` and either `prev` is a value in `nodes[s]` and `curr` is a value in `nodes[nodes[curr][1]]`, or `prev` is `curr` and `curr` is a value in `nodes[curr]` and the first element of `nodes[curr]` is not equal to `prev`. If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is a value in `nodes[prev][1]`. Otherwise, `curr` is a value in `nodes[prev][0]` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`.**
