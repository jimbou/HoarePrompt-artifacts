Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where nodes[u] contains v and nodes[v] contains u for all u and v read from stdin and nodes has at least n-1 key-value pairs, i is n-1, stdin is empty, s is a key in nodes where the length of nodes[key] is 1, e is a key in nodes where the length of nodes[key] is 1, tree is a list containing s, prev is s, curr is a value in nodes[s].
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least `n-1` key-value pairs, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `s` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `e` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, and `prev` and `curr` are values in `nodes` such that `curr` is not equal to `e` and either `prev` is a value in `nodes[s]` and `curr` is a value in `nodes[nodes[curr][1]]`, or `prev` is `curr` and `curr` is a value in `nodes[curr]` and the first element of `nodes[curr]` is not equal to `prev`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least `n-1` key-value pairs, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `s` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `e` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `prev` and `curr` are values in `nodes` such that `curr` is not equal to `e` and either `prev` is a value in `nodes[s]` and `curr` is a value in `nodes[nodes[curr][1]]`, or `prev` is `curr` and `curr` is a value in `nodes[curr]` and the first element of `nodes[curr]` is not equal to `prev`. If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is a value in `nodes[prev][1]`. Otherwise, `curr` is a value in `nodes[prev][0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where nodes[u] contains v and nodes[v] contains u for all u and v read from stdin and nodes has at least n-1 key-value pairs, i is n-1, stdin is empty, s is a key in nodes where the length of nodes[key] is 1, e is a key in nodes where the length of nodes[key] is 1, tree is a list containing s and curr, prev and curr are values in nodes such that curr is not equal to e and either prev is a value in nodes[s] and curr is a value in nodes[nodes[curr][1]], or prev is curr and curr is a value in nodes[curr] and the first element of nodes[curr] is not equal to prev. If nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, then curr is a value in nodes[prev][1]. Otherwise, curr is a value in nodes[prev][0] and curr must not be equal to e.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
