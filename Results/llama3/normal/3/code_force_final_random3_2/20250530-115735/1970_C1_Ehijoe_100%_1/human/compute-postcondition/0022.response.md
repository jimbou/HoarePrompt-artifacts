Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least `n-1` key-value pairs, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `s` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `e` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `prev` is `s`, and `curr` is a value in `nodes[s]` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, `nodes`, `i`, `stdin`, `s`, and `e` remain the same as in the initial state. The list `tree` now contains two elements: `s` and `curr`, where `curr` is a value in `nodes[s]` and is not equal to `e`. The value of `prev` is still `s`.
