Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least one key-value pair, `ends` is a list containing one element which is the current key, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains one integer `u`. The current value of `nodes[key]` has exactly one element.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 2, `t` is still 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is still a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least one key-value pair, `ends` now contains one element which is the current key, `i` is still `n-1`, stdin still contains one integer `u`. The current value of `nodes[key]` still has exactly one element.
