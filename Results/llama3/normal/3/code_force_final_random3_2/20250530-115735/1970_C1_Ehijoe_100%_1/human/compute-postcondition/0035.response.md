Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where nodes[u] contains v and nodes[v] contains u for all u and v read from stdin and nodes has at least n-1 key-value pairs, i is n-1, stdin is empty, s is a key in nodes where the length of nodes[key] is 1, e is a key in nodes where the length of nodes[key] is 1, tree is a list containing s and curr, prev is a value in nodes such that either prev is a value in nodes[s] and curr is a value in nodes[nodes[curr][1]], or prev is curr and curr is a value in nodes[curr] and the first element of nodes[curr] is not equal to prev, and curr is a value in nodes such that curr is not equal to e and either curr is a value in nodes[nodes[curr][1]] or curr is a value in nodes[prev][1] if nodes[curr][0] is equal to prev, otherwise curr is a value in nodes[prev][0] and curr must not be equal to e.**
