Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least `n-1` key-value pairs, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `s` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `e` is a key in `nodes` where the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `prev` and `curr` are values in `nodes` such that `curr` is not equal to `e` and either `prev` is a value in `nodes[s]` and `curr` is a value in `nodes[nodes[curr][1]]`, or `prev` is `curr` and `curr` is a value in `nodes[curr]` and the first element of `nodes[curr]` is not equal to `prev`. If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is a value in `nodes[prev][1]`. Otherwise, `curr` is a value in `nodes[prev][0]` and `curr` must not be equal to `e`.**

The code appends the value of `curr` to the list `tree`. The value of `curr` is not changed, but it is added to the list `tree`. The other variables remain unchanged.
