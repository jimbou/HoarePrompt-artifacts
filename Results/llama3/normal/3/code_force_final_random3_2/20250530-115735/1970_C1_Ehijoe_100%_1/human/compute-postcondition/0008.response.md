Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin, `ends` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains one integer `u`.**

In this output state, a new variable `ends` has been introduced and is assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one integer `u`.
