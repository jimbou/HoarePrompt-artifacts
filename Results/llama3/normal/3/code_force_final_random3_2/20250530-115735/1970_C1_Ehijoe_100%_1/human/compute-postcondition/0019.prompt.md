Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin, `ends` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains one integer `u`.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        ends.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least one key-value pair, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains one integer `u`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `ends` is a list containing one element which is the current key. Otherwise, `ends` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains one integer `u`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `ends` is a list containing two elements which are the two keys in the nodes. Otherwise, `ends` is a list containing one element which is the current key.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u` for all `u` and `v` read from stdin and `nodes` has at least 3 key-value pairs, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains one integer `u`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `ends` is a list containing one element which is the current key. Otherwise, `ends` is a list containing two elements which are the two keys in the nodes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
