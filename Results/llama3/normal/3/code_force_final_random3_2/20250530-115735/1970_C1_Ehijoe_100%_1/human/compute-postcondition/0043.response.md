Output: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is a defaultdict with a default value of an empty list where nodes[u] contains v and nodes[v] contains u for all u and v read from stdin and nodes has at least n-1 key-value pairs, i is n-1, stdin is empty, s is a key in nodes where the length of nodes[key] is 1, e is a key in nodes where the length of nodes[key] is 1, tree is a list containing s, e, and all the nodes between s and e, and e, prev is e, curr is e, start is an integer read from stdin, idx is the index of start in tree, and moves is a list containing idx and n - idx - 1. The current value of at least one move in moves is an odd number, and 'Ron' is printed**
