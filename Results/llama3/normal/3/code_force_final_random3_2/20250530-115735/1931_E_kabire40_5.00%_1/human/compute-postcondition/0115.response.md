Output State: **rev_res has increased by the value of the element at index x in rev_val, x is 3, y is 2, operational_list is an empty list, stdin is empty, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, rev_val is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by appending the string representation of the element at index x in rev_val. The value of x is still 3, and y remains 2. The operational_list is still empty, and stdin is empty. The list_len and max_power are still strings representing the first and second input values respectively. The rev_val is still a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements.
