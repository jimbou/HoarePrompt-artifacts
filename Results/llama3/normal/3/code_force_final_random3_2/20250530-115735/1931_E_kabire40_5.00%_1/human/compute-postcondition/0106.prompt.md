Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is an empty string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of strings representing the input values, x is not defined, val_in is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a list, rev_res is a string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of strings representing the input values that must have at least 1 element, x is the first element in the list, val_in is not defined, x_rev is the reverse of the first element in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the first element in the operational_list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the first element in operational_list and rev_res is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a list, rev_res is a string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of strings representing the input values that must have at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list, val_in is not defined, x_rev is the reverse of the second element in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the concatenation of its previous value and the second element in the operational_list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the second element in the operational_list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a list, rev_res is a string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of strings representing the input values that must have at least 3 elements, x is the third element in the list, val_in is not defined, x_rev is the reverse of the third element in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the concatenation of its previous value and the third element in the operational_list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the third element in the operational_list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
