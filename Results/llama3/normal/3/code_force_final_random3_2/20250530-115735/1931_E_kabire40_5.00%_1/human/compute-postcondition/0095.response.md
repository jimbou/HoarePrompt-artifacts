Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a list, rev_res is a string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of strings representing the input values that must have at least 1 element, x is the first element in the list, val_in is not defined, x_rev is the reverse of the first element in the list converted to an integer. If the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of x, then rev_res is the first element in the operational_list. Otherwise, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the first element in operational_list and rev_res is an empty string.***
