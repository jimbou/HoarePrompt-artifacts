Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed, `rev_val` is a list that contains the reversed value of `x`**.

In this output state, the value of `rev_val` has been updated to include the reversed value of `x`, which is the second element in the `operational_list`. The other variables remain unchanged.
