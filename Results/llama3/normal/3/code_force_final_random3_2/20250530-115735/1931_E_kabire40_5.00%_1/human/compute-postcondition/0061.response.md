Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the sum of its previous value and `x_rev`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list that contains the reversed value of `x`.***
