Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, y is 1, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of input values, x is equal to the length of rev_val.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least one element, `x` is 0. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_val` is an empty list and `rev_res` is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x` plus the string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the `x` value at index `x` in `rev_val`, plus the string representation of the current value of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string representation of 0 and `rev_res` is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of the string representation of `x` plus the string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the `x` value at index `x` in `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is increased by the value of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list that contains the reversed value of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the sum of its previous value and `x_rev`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list that contains the reversed value of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
