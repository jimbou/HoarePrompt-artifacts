Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed.**

In this output state, the value of `x_rev` is calculated by reversing the string `x` and converting it to an integer. For example, if `x` is "123", then `x_rev` would be 321. The other variables remain unchanged.
