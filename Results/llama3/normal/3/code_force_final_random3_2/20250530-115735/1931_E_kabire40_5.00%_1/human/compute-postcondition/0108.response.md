To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `rev_val`. The loop will execute if `rev_val` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `rev_val` to have at least one element.

State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a sorted list that must have at least 1 element, rev_res is a string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is 0, val_in is not defined, x_rev is not defined**
