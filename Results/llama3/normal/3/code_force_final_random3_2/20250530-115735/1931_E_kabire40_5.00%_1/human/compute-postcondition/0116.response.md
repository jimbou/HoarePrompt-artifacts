Output State: **rev_res is the concatenation of its original value and the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val, x is 3, y is 2, list_len is a string representing the first input value, max_power is a string representing the second input value, operational_list is an empty list, stdin is empty, rev_val is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the value of the element at index x in rev_val to val_in. Since x is 3, val_in becomes the 4th element of rev_val (remember that indexing starts at 0). The second line concatenates the reverse of val_in to rev_res. Since val_in is the 4th element of rev_val, the reverse of this element is concatenated to rev_res. No other variables are affected.
