Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 0, rev_val is a sorted list of reversed integer values of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x and must have at least 3 elements, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is 3 if x was even, otherwise x is an even number. rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the reversed string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by adding the reversed string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val` to it. The value of `val_in` is the value at index `x` in `rev_val`, which is a sorted list of reversed integer values of `x` for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of the string representation of `x` and must have at least 3 elements. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
