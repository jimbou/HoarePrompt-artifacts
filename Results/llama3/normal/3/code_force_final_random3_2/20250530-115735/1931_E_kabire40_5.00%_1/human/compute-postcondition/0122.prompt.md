Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a sorted list, rev_res is a string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is not defined, val_in is not defined, x_rev is not defined.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a sorted list that must have at least 1 element, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list. If x is divisible by 2, then rev_res is a string that includes the string representation of the first element of rev_val and val_in is the first element of rev_val. If x is not divisible by 2, then rev_res is a string that includes the reverse of the value at index x in rev_val and val_in is the value at index x in rev_val.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` is empty, `y` is 2, `rev_val` is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is an empty list. If `x` is even, `rev_res` has increased by the value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of its original value and the reverse of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a sorted list that must have at least 3 elements, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is 3. If x is even, rev_res is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the element at index x in rev_val. If x is odd, rev_res is the concatenation of its original value and the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
