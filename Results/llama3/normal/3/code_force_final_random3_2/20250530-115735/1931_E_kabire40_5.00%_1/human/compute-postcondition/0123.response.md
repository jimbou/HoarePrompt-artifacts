Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a sorted list, rev_res is a string that includes the string representation of the elements at even indices in rev_val and the reverse of the elements at odd indices in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is the last index of rev_val. The current value of max_power is such that 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is less than the integer value of rev_res.***
