Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 0, rev_val is a list of reversed integer values of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have an empty standard input, the variable y will remain 0, the list rev_val will contain the reversed integer values of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x, the string rev_res will be a concatenation of the string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x, the variables list_len and max_power will still represent the first and second input values respectively, and the list operational_list will be empty.
