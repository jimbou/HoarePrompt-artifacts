Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string representation of 0, `rev_res` is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least one element, `x` is 0, `x_rev` is 0**

In this output state, the only change is that `rev_val` now contains the reversed string representation of 0, which is '0'. The other variables remain unchanged.
