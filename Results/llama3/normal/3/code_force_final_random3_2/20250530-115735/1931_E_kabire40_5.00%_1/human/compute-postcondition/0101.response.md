The only object in the loop head is variable  x and list  operational_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the operational_list.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, operational_list has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element in the list.
State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a list, rev_res is a string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of strings representing the input values that must have at least 3 elements, x is the third element in the list, val_in is not defined, x_rev is the reverse of the third element in the list converted to an integer.**
