Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 0, rev_val is a sorted list of reversed integer values of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x and must have at least 3 elements, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is 3 if x was even, otherwise x is an even number. rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val. If x was even, the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res, otherwise the reversed string representation of the value at index x in rev_val is added to rev_res. val_in is the integer value of the value at index x in rev_val.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the value at index x in rev_val to val_in. The second line appends the string representation of val_in to rev_res. No other variables are affected.
