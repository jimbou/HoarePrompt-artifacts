Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list, `x_rev` is the reversed integer value of `x`, `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, otherwise `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` appended to its original value, and `rev_val` is an empty list if the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, otherwise `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer value of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The stdin remains empty, and the values of `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`, and `x_rev` remain the same. However, the value of `rev_res` changes. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_res` becomes the string representation of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_res` becomes the string representation of `x` appended to its original value. The value of `rev_val` also changes accordingly. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` remains a list containing the reversed integer value of `x`.
