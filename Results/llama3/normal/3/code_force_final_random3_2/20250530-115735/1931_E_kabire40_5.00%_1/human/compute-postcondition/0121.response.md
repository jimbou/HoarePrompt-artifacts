Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a sorted list that must have at least 3 elements, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is 3. If x is even, rev_res is the concatenation of its original value and the string representation of the element at index x in rev_val. If x is odd, rev_res is the concatenation of its original value and the reverse of the element at index x in rev_val.***
