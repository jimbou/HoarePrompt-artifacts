Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least one element, `x` is 0. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_val` is an empty list and `rev_res` is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x` plus the string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the `x` value at index `x` in `rev_val`, plus the string representation of the current value of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string representation of 0 and `rev_res` is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of the string representation of `x` plus the string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the `x` value at index `x` in `rev_val`.***
