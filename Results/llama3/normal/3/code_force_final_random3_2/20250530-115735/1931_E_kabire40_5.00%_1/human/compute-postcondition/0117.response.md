Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `y` is 2, `rev_val` is a sorted list that must have at least 2 elements, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is an empty list. If `x` is even, `rev_res` has increased by the value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of its original value and the reverse of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.***
