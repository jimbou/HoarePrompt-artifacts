Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a list containing the reverse of the second element in the operational_list, rev_res is a string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of strings representing the input values that must have at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list, val_in is not defined, x_rev is the reverse of the second element in the list converted to an integer.**

In this output state, the only change is that the rev_val list now contains the reverse of the second element in the operational_list. The other variables remain unchanged. The operational_list still has at least 2 elements, and x is still the second element in the list. The stdin is still empty, and the other variables maintain their initial values.
