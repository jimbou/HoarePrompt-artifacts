Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 0, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is equal to the length of rev_val. If the current value of rev_res is greater than 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power, then 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, if 10 to the power of the integer value of max_power is greater than or equal to the integer value of rev_res, then 'Anna' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 1, rev_val is a sorted list of reversed string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x and has at least 3 elements, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the value at index x in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is equal to the length of rev_val. If x is even, val_in is an integer representing the value at index x in rev_val and rev_res has been appended with the string representation of val_in. If x is odd, rev_res has been appended with the reversed string representation of val_in. If the current value of rev_res is greater than 10 to the power of the integer value of max_power, then 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 10 to the power of the integer value of max_power is larger than or equal to the integer value of rev_res, and 'Anna' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a sorted list, rev_res is a string that includes the string representation of the elements at even indices in rev_val and the reverse of the elements at odd indices in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is the last index of rev_val. If 10 raised to the power of the integer value of max_power is less than the integer value of rev_res, then 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
