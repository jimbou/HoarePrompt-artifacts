Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `x_rev` is the reversed integer value of `x`, If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer value of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` appended to its original value and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer value of `x` and the reversed string value of `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `rev_val` now contains the reversed string value of `x` in addition to its previous value. This is because the code appends the reversed string value of `x` to `rev_val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
