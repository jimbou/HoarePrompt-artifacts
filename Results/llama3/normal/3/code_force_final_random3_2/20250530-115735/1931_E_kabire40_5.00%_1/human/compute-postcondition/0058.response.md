Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of input values that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of `x` reversed.**

In this output state, the value of `x_rev` has been updated to be the integer value of `x` reversed. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x_rev` is now a specific integer value that is the reverse of the original value of `x`.
