Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 1, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is a list of input values, x is equal to the length of rev_val.**

Explanation:
The first line of the code does not affect any variables. The second line assigns the first and second input values to list_len and max_power respectively. The third line assigns a list of input values to operational_list. The value of x is still equal to the length of rev_val, which is an empty list. The value of rev_res is still a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val. The value of y is still 1. Stdin is now empty because two lines of input have been read.
