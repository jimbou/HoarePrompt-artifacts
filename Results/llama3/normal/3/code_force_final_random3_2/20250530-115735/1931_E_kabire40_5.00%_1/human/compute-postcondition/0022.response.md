Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed integer values of `x` for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of the string representation of `x` and must have at least 1 element, `rev_res` is a string of concatenated string representations of `x` for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is an empty list. The current value of `x` is 0 and it is an even number.***
