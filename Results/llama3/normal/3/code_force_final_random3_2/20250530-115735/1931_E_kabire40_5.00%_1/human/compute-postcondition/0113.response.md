Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 2, rev_val is a sorted list that must have at least 1 element, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list. If x is divisible by 2, then rev_res is a string that includes the string representation of the first element of rev_val and val_in is the first element of rev_val. If x is not divisible by 2, then rev_res is a string that includes the reverse of the value at index x in rev_val and val_in is the value at index x in rev_val.***
