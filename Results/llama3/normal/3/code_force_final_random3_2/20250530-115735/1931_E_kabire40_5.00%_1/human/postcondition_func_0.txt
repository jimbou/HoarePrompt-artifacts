This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and determines the winner ('Sasha' or 'Anna') based on the processed data. It accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the result for each test case. The function iterates over the test cases, reverses and sorts certain numbers, and compares the result to a given power of 10 to decide the winner. After processing all test cases, stdin is left empty.
