Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list, `x_rev` is the reversed integer value of `x`, If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` appended to its original value and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer value of `x`.**

The code assigns the reversed integer value of `x` to `x_rev`. The value of `x_rev` is calculated by reversing the string representation of `x` and converting it back to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
