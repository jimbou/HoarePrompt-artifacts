Output State: **stdin is empty, y is 1, rev_val is a sorted list of reversed string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x and has at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the value at index x in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is at least 3, val_in is an integer representing the value at index x in rev_val, rev_res has been appended with the reversed string representation of val_in.**

In this output state, the values of stdin, y, rev_val, list_len, max_power, operational_list, and x remain unchanged. The value of rev_res has been modified by appending the reversed string representation of val_in. The value of val_in has been assigned the value at index x in rev_val.
