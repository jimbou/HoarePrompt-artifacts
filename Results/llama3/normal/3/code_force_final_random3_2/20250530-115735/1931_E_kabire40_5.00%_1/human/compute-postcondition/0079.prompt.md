Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed string representations of `x` for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, `rev_res` is a string of concatenated string representations of `x` for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x` plus the string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the `x` value at index `x` in `rev_val`, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is an empty list, `x` is equal to the length of `rev_val`.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin is empty, y is 1, rev_val is a sorted list of reversed string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x and has at least 1 element, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the value at index x in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is at least 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin is empty, y is 1, rev_val is a sorted list of reversed string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is not equal to the length of the string representation of x and has at least 2 elements, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the value at index x in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is at least 2. If x is even, val_in is an integer representing the value at index x in rev_val. If x is odd, rev_res has been appended with the reversed string representation of val_in.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `stdin` is empty, `y` is 1, `rev_val` is a sorted list of reversed string representations of `x` for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is not equal to the length of the string representation of `x` and has at least 2 elements, `rev_res` is a string of concatenated string representations of `x` for which the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x` plus the string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the `x` value at index `x` in `rev_val` plus the string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val` if `x` is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the value at index `x` in `rev_val`, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is an empty list, `x` is at least 3. If `x` is even, `val_in` is an integer representing the value at index `x` in `rev_val` and `rev_res` has been appended with the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` has been appended with the reversed string representation of `val_in`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
