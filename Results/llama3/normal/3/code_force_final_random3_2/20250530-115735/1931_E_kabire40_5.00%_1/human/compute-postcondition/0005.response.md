Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is the string representation of `x`, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `x_rev` is the reversed integer value of `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`**

In this output state, the only change is that `rev_res` now holds the string representation of `x`, which is the first element in the `operational_list`. All other variables remain unchanged.
