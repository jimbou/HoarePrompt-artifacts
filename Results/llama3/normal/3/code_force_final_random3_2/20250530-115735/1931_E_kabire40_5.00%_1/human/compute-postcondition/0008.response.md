Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `y` is 0, `list_len` and `max_power` are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, `operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list, `x_rev` is the reversed integer value of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the string representation of `x`, then `rev_res` is the string representation of `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed integer value of `x` and `rev_res` is an empty string.***
