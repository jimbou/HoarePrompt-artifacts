Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, y is 0, rev_val is an empty list, rev_res is a string of concatenated string representations of x for which the length of the string representation of x_rev is equal to the length of the string representation of x plus the string representation of the value at index x in rev_val if x is even, otherwise plus the reversed string representation of the x value at index x in rev_val, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first and second input values respectively, operational_list is an empty list, x is equal to the length of rev_val, and 10 to the power of the integer value of max_power is greater than or equal to the integer value of rev_res***
