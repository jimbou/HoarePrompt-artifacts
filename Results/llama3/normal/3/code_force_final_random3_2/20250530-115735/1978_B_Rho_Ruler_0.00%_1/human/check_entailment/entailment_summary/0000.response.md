Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit. However, the program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic to calculate the profit.

The function `func_1` is calculating the profit as `k * b + (n - k) * a`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns and the usual price for the remaining (n - k) buns.

Moreover, the function is returning whether the calculated profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition to determine the optimal value of k.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
