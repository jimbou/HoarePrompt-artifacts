#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer, a and b are non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that k <= min(n, b).
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns whether the value of ans is less than or equal to n times the maximum of a and b, where ans is the result of the expression k * b + (n - k) * a, k is an integer, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, n is a non-negative integer such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of n and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates a weighted sum of two non-negative integers `a` and `b` based on the value of an integer `k` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns whether this sum is less than or equal to `n` times the maximum of `a` and `b`.
