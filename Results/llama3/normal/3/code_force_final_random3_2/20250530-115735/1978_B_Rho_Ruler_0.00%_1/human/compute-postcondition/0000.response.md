The code snippet calculates the value of `ans` based on the initial values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. The first line initializes `ans` to 0. The second line adds the product of `k` and `b` to `ans`, effectively calculating the contribution of the first `k` items to the total. The third line adds the product of `(n - k)` and `a` to `ans`, calculating the contribution of the remaining `(n - k)` items to the total.

Since `k` is an integer, `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `k <= min(n, b)`, we can infer that `k` is less than or equal to both `n` and `b`. This means that the first `k` items contribute `k * b` to the total, and the remaining `(n - k)` items contribute `(n - k) * a` to the total.

Output State: **ans is k * b + (n - k) * a, k is an integer, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, n is a non-negative integer such that k <= min(n, b)**
