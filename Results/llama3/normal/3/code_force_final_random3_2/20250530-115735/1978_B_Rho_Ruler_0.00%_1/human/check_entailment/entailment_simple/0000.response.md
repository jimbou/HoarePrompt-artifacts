Reasoning: 

The given program is attempting to solve the problem using a binary search approach. The function `func_1` is used to determine whether a given value of `k` is "good" or not. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. 

The function `func_1` is supposed to return `True` if the profit obtained by selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price is less than or equal to the maximum possible profit, which is `n * max(a, b)`. However, the function is actually calculating the total profit for the given `k` and comparing it with `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition.

The correct condition should be to calculate the total profit for the given `k` and compare it with the total profit for `k-1`. If the profit for `k` is greater than or equal to the profit for `k-1`, then `k` is a "good" value.

However, the main issue with the program is that it is using a binary search approach to find the maximum profit, but the profit function is not monotonic. The profit function can have multiple local maxima, and the binary search approach may not find the global maximum.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
