Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 2, val is the first element of arr. If the current element in arr is equal to val, then cnt is 3 and flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in arr is not equal to val, then flag is False, ans is the minimum of Infinity and cnt which is ans is 1, and cnt is 2. Otherwise, if the current element in arr is equal to val, then cnt is 2 and flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in arr is not equal to val, then flag is False, ans is the minimum of 0 and 1 which is 0, and cnt is 1 or 0.***
