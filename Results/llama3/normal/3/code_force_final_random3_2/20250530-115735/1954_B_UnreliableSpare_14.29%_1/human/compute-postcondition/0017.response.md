Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 0, `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and `cnt`, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 0. The element at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to `val`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value (Infinity) and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
