The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` is 0. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is 1.

The other variables are not affected by this code. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` still contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is still 0, `flag` is still True if all elements in `arr` are equal and False otherwise, `ans` is still Infinity, `val` is still the first element of `arr`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is still equal to `val`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 0, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal and False otherwise, `ans` is Infinity, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**
