Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If the current element in `arr` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 3 and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and `cnt` which is `ans` is 1, and `cnt` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If the current element in `arr` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is now 3. If the current element in `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `cnt` is now 2 and `ans` is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
