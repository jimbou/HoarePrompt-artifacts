Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, ans is Infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == val:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 0, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If the current element in `arr` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1 and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and `cnt`, and `cnt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 1, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If the current element in `arr` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and `cnt` which is `ans` is 0 or 1, and `cnt` is 1 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is 2, val is the first element of arr. If the current element in arr is equal to val, then cnt is 3 and flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in arr is not equal to val, then flag is False, ans is the minimum of Infinity and cnt which is ans is 1, and cnt is 2. Otherwise, if the current element in arr is equal to val, then cnt is 2 and flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in arr is not equal to val, then flag is False, ans is the minimum of 0 and 1 which is 0, and cnt is 1 or 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
