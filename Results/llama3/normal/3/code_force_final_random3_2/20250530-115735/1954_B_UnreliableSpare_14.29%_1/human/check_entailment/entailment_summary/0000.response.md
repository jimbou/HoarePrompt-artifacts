Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. 

If the elements are not all equal, it finds the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive equal elements. The minimum count is updated whenever a different element is encountered. 

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array has only one element or all elements are equal. 

The use of the Decimal module is unnecessary in this case, as the minimum count can be represented by an integer. However, it does not affect the correctness of the program. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True. 

Correctness: **True**
