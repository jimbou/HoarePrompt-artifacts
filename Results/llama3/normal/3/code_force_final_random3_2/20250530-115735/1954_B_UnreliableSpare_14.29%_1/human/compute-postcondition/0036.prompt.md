You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, ans is the minimum of Infinity and cnt which is ans is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or ... or n, and cnt is 0.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` which is 0, and `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. If all elements in `arr` are equal, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` which is 0 is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `i` is `n`, `flag` is True, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` which is 0, and `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and -1 is printed

Case_2: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `i` is `n`, `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` which is 0, `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and not all elements in `arr` are equal, and the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` which is 0 is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
