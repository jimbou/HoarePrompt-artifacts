Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 1, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If the current element in `arr` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and 1, and `cnt` is 1**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was either 1 or 0 in the initial state, it is now either 2 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `flag` is still dependent on whether all elements in `arr` are equal, and the value of `ans` is still the minimum of Infinity and the previous value of `cnt`.
