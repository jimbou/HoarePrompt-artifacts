Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array contains only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the array [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] is a beautiful array, but the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2, because we need to remove at least two elements to make the array not beautiful.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements with the same value, but it does not consider the case when the array contains only two distinct elements and they are alternating. To fix this, the program should also check for the case when the array contains only two distinct elements and they are alternating, and output the minimum count of consecutive elements with the same value plus one.
