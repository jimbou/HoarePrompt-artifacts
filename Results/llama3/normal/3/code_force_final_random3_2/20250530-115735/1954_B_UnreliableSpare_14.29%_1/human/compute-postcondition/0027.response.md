Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, ans is the minimum of Infinity and cnt which is ans is 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or ... or n, and cnt is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, which means the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `arr`. The variable `flag` remains True if all elements in `arr` are equal, and False otherwise. The variable `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of Infinity and the count of consecutive equal elements in `arr`, which can be any value between 0 and `n`. The variable `cnt` has been reset to 0. The other variables in the precondition, `n`, `arr`, `stdin`, and `val`, remain unchanged.
