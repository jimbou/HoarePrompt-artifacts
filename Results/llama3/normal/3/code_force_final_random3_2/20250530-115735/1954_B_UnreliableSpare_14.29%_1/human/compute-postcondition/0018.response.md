Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 0, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If the current element in `arr` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 1 and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and `cnt`, and `cnt` is 0.***
