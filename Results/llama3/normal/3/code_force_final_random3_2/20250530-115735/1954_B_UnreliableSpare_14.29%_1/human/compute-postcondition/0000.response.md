Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, flag is True, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, which is the range specified in the precondition. The `arr` variable is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and `n`, as specified in the precondition. The `flag` variable is set to `True`. The stdin now contains `t - 1` test cases, as one test case has been processed by the code.
