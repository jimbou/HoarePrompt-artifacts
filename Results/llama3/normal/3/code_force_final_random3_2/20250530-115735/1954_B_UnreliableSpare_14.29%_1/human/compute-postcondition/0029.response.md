Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `i` is `n`, `flag` is True, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` which is 0, and `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. The current value of `flag` is True, indicating that all elements in `arr` are equal.***
