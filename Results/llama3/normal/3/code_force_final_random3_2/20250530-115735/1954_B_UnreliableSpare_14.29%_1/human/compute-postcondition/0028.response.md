Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `i` is `n`, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` which is 0, and `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now 0, as it was previously either 0 or a positive integer, and the minimum of any number with 0 is 0.
