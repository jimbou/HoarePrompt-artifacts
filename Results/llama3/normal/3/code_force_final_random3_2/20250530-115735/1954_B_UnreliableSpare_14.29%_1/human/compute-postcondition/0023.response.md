The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 3 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If the current element in `arr` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of Infinity and `cnt` which is `ans` is 0 or 1, and `cnt` is 1 or 0.**
