Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `i` is 2, `val` is the first element of `arr`. If the current element in `arr` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are equal, False otherwise. If the current element in `arr` is not equal to `val`, then `flag` is False, `ans` is the minimum of 0 and 1 which is 0, and `cnt` is 1 or 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 1 or 0, and `ans` was previously either 0 or 1, the minimum of these values is 0. Therefore, `ans` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
