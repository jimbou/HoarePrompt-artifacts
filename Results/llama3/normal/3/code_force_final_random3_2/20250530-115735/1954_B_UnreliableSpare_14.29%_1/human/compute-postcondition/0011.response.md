Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of 'i' will be equal to 'n', and the value of 'flag' will be True if all elements in the list 'arr' are equal, and False otherwise. The values of 'n', 'arr', and 'stdin' remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
