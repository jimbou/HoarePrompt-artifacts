Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is n, flag is True if all elements in arr are equal, False otherwise, ans is Infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0.**

In this output state, the initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of three new variables: `ans`, `val`, and `cnt`. The value of `ans` is set to infinity, `val` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `arr`, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. The rest of the variables (`n`, `arr`, `stdin`, `i`, and `flag`) retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
