Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by repeatedly applying a specific operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`arr`).
3.  It then checks if all elements in the array are the same by comparing each element with its previous one. If all elements are the same, it sets a flag (`flag`) to `True`.
4.  If the flag is `True`, it means the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so it prints `-1`.
5.  If the flag is `False`, it means the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. It then initializes a variable (`ans`) to store the minimum number of elements to remove and a variable (`cnt`) to count the occurrences of the first element (`val`) in the array.
6.  It iterates over the array, incrementing `cnt` whenever it encounters the first element (`val`). Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
7.  After iterating over the entire array, it updates `ans` one more time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last sequence of the first element.
8.  Finally, it prints the minimum number of elements to remove (`ans`).

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
