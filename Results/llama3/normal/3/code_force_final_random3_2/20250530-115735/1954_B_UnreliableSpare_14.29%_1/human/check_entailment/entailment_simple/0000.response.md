Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are equal, in which case it prints -1 as it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that it stops being beautiful.

For the case where not all elements in the array are equal, the program correctly finds the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array in order for it to stop being beautiful. It does this by iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum count of consecutive equal elements.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array has only one element, in which case it prints -1.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
