Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself. It then checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If the elements are not all equal, the program then finds the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive equal elements. The minimum count is updated whenever a smaller count is found.

Finally, the program prints the minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
