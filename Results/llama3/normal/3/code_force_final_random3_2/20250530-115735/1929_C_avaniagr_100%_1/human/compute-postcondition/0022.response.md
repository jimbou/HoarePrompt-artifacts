Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least one line, `s` is the second line of the first test case, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0, and `x - k + 3` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated to `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, which is the result of the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions `x` is greater than `k - 1` and `x - k + 3` is greater than 0 are still valid.
