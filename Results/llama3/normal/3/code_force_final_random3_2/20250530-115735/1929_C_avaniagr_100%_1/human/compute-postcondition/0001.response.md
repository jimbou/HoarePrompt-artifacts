Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least one line, `s` is the second line of the first test case**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers because they are assigned the result of `map(int, s.split())`, which converts the space-separated integers in `s` to integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but now it has at least one line because the first test case has been partially read (its second line `s` has been read). The value of `s` is still the second line of the first test case, but its contents have been split and converted to integers, which are now stored in `k`, `x`, and `a`.
