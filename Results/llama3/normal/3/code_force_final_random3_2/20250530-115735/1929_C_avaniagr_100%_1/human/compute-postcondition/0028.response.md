Postcondition: **k, x, and a are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least one line, s is the second line of the first test case, x is greater than k, z is k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)^2 + ... + (k - 2) // (k - 1)^(x - k + 2), i is x - k + 2, and x - k + 3 is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of a is greater than or equal to z.**
