Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least one line, `s` is the second line of the first test case. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, or if `x` is greater than `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, where `z` is the sum of the series `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)^2 + ... + (k - 2) // (k - 1)^(x - k + 2)`, otherwise 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the third line of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines, `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 2, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `k - 2` plus the sum of `x - k + 3` iterations of the expression `(k - 2 + Î£((k - 2 + ... + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1)`, and if the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the fourth line of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is an integer equal to `(x - k + 3) * (2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + (x - k + 2)`, `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
