You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9).
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the last line of the last test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least as many lines as the number of iterations of the loop, `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a` in each iteration. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is an integer equal to `(x - k + 3) * (2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + (x - k + 2)`, `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the last line of the last test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least as many lines as the number of iterations of the loop, `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a` in each iteration. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is an integer equal to `(x - k + 3) * (2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + (x - k + 2)`, `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
