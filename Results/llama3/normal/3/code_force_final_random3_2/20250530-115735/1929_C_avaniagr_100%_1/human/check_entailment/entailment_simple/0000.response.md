Reasoning: The program correctly implements the strategy for Sasha to guarantee winning any number of coins. It checks the conditions for Sasha to win based on the values of k, x, and a. If x is less than k - 1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x + 1. If x is equal to k - 1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x + 2. If x is greater than k - 1, it calculates the value of z based on the formula and checks if a is greater than or equal to z. The program correctly prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
