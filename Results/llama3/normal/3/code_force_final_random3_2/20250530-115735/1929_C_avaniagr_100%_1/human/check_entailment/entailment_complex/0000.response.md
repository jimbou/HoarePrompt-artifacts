Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins for any integer n, given the rules of the casino and the promotion. The program checks the conditions for each test case and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the value of a is greater than or equal to a calculated value z, which depends on the values of k and x.

The program handles the different cases correctly:

- If x is less than k - 1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x + 1.
- If x is equal to k - 1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x + 2.
- If x is greater than k - 1, it calculates the value of z based on k and x, and checks if a is greater than or equal to z.

The program also correctly iterates through all test cases and prints the result for each case.

Correctness: **True**
