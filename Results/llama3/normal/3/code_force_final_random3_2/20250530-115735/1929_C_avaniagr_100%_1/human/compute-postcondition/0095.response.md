Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the last line of the last test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least as many lines as the number of iterations of the loop, `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a` in each iteration. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is an integer equal to `(x - k + 3) * (2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + (x - k + 2)`, `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases in the input, and for each test case, it has printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. The loop has also updated the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `s`, remains unchanged.
