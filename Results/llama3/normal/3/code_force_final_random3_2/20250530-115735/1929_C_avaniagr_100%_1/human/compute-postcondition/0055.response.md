Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the third line of the first test case, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, `x - k + 3` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain the same as they were assigned from the third line of the first test case. The value of `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The condition `x - k + 3` is still greater than 2. The value of `i` remains 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least two lines.
