Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the fourth line of the first test case, `z` is an integer equal to `(x - k + 3) * (2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + (x - k + 2)`, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines, `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their initial values, `z` is updated based on the number of iterations (`x - k + 3`) and the initial values of `k` and `x`, and the loop counter `i` is equal to the number of iterations minus 1. The state of the input stream (`stdin`) remains unchanged.
