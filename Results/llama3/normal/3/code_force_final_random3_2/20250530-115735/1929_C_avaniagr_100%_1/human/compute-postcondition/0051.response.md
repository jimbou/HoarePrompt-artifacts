Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the third line of the first test case, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, `x - k + 3` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `(k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value `k - 2`. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, `x - k + 3`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least two lines.
