Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the fourth line of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated to the values from the fourth line of the first test case. The variable `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been processed, so it now contains at least two lines.
