Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the fourth line of the first test case, `z` is an integer equal to `4 * (2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 2 * k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines, `x - k + 3` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition `x - k + 3` is greater than 2 is still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least two lines.
