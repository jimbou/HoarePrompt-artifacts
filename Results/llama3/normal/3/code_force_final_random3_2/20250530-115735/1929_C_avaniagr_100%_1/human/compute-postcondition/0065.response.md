Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the third line of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines, `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` equals `k - 1`, 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 2, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is calculated as `k - 2` plus the sum of `x - k + 3` iterations of the expression `(k - 2 + Î£((k - 2 + ... + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1)`, and if the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
