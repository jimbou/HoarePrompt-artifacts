Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least one line, `s` is the second line of the first test case, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, and `z` is `k - 2`.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least one line, and `s` remains the second line of the first test case. The conditions `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` and `x` is not equal to `k - 1` are still valid. Additionally, a new variable `z` is introduced and assigned the value `k - 2`.
