Postcondition: ***`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the third line of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines, `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x` plus 1, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.***
