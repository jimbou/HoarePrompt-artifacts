Postcondition: ***`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least one line, `s` is the second line of the first test case, and `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, where `z` is the sum of the series `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)^2 + ... + (k - 2) // (k - 1)^(x - k + 2)`, otherwise 'NO' is printed.***
