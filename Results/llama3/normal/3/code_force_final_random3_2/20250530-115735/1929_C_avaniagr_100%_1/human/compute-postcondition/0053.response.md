Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the third line of the first test case, `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, `x - k + 3` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines.**

In this output state, the value of `z` has been updated by adding the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `x - k + 3` is greater than 1 is still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with at least two lines.
