Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least one line, `s` is the second line of the first test case, `x` is greater than `k`, `z` is `k + 1 + (k - 2) / (k - 1) + (k - 2) / (k - 1)^2 + z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2, and `x - k + 3` is greater than 2**

The value of `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The expression `z // (k - 1)` performs integer division, which means it rounds down to the nearest whole number. The `+ 1` adds one to the result of the division. The new value of `z` is the sum of its previous value and this updated expression.
