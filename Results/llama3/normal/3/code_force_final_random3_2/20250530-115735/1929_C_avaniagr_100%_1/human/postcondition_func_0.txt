This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers k, x, and a. It then checks the conditions for each test case and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the value of a is greater than or equal to a calculated value z, which depends on the values of k and x. The function iterates through all test cases and prints the result for each case.
