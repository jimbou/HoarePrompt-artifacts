Based on the precondition, the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` have been assigned values from the third line of the first test case, but the specific values are not provided. The variable `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`.

The print statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
