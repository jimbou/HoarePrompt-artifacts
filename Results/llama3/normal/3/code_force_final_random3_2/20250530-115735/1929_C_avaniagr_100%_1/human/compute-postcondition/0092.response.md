Postcondition: ***`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the fourth line of the first test case, `z` is an integer equal to `(x - k + 3) * (2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + (x - k + 2)`, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines, `x - k + 3` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `x - k + 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
