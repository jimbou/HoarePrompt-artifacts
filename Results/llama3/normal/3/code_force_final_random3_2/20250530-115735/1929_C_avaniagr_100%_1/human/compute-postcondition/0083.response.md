The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, x and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `x` and `k`. If `i` is less than `x - k + 3`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x - k + 3` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x - k + 3` must be greater than 2.
State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the fourth line of the first test case, `z` is an integer equal to `3 * (2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 2 * k - 3 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines, `x - k + 3` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
