Postcondition: ***`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least one line, `s` is the second line of the first test case. The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.***
