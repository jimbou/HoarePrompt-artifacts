Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers and have been assigned the values from the third line of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines, `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated to the integers from the third line of the first test case. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been partially processed, leaving at least two lines remaining. The variable `s` is no longer assigned as it has been used to assign values to `k`, `x`, and `a`.
