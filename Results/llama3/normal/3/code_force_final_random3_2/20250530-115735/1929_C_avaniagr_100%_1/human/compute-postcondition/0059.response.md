Output: **k, x, and a are integers and have been assigned the values from the third line of the first test case, z is k - 2 + Σ((k - 2 + Σ((k - 2 + ... + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1) for x - k + 3 iterations, x - k + 3 is greater than or equal to 0, i is x - k + 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with at least two lines. The current value of a is greater than or equal to z, and 'YES' is printed**
