Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer which is the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 1, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, cnt is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged if `cnt` is 0, or becomes 1 if `cnt` is 1 and the original `ans` is greater than 1. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by the code.
