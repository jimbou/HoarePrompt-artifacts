Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer which is the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt which is 0, cnt is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sets the value of `cnt` to 0. The second line sets the value of `ans` to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `ans` becomes an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive). The values of `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `t`, `_`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
