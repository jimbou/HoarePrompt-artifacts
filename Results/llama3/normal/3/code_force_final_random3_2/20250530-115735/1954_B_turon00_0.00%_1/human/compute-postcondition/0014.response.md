The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`**
