Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. It correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same, in which case it outputs -1.

2. It correctly finds the minimum length of a subsequence that contains the same number repeatedly. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of the current number. Whenever it encounters a different number, it updates the minimum length if necessary.

3. It correctly handles the case where the array contains only one element, in which case it outputs -1.

4. It correctly handles the case where the array contains multiple elements but only one distinct element, in which case it outputs -1.

5. It correctly handles the case where the array contains multiple distinct elements, in which case it outputs the minimum length of a subsequence that contains the same number repeatedly.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
