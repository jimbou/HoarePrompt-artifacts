Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

3. It then checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

4. If not all elements are the same, it initializes a variable `cnt` to keep track of the count of the first element `tmp` in the array, and a variable `ans` to store the minimum count of `tmp` found so far.

5. It then iterates over the array. If the current element is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`. If the current element is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

6. After the loop, it updates `ans` one more time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last sequence of `tmp` in the array.

7. Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
