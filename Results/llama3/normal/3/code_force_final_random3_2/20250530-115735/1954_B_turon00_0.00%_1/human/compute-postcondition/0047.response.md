Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**

The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and `tmp` is still an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive). The set `aa` still contains integers, and `i` is still equal to `n`.
