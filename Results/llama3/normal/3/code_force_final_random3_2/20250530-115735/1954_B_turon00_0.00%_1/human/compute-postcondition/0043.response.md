Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, i is 2, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in the list a, cnt is 3 if a[i] is equal to tmp, otherwise cnt is 2 if a[i] is not equal to tmp but a[i-1] is equal to tmp, otherwise cnt is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` but `a[i-1]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 2. If neither of these conditions is true, then `cnt` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
