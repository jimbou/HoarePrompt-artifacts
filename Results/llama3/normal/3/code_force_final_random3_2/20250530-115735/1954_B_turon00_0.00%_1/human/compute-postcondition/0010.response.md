Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is n, `i` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The value of `a[i]` is still equal to `tmp`.
