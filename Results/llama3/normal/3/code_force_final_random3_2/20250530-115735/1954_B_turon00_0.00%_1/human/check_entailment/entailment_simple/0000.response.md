Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3.  It checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking its length. If all elements are the same, it prints -1, which is correct according to the problem statement.
4.  If not all elements are the same, it initializes a counter `cnt` to 0 and a variable `ans` to `n`. It then iterates over the array, incrementing `cnt` whenever it encounters an element equal to the first element `tmp`. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
5.  After iterating over the entire array, it updates `ans` one last time to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
6.  Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed in the general case.

Correctness: **True**
