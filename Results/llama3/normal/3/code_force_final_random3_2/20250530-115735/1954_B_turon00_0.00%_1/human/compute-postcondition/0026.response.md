To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is n, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a` if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a` is being printed**
