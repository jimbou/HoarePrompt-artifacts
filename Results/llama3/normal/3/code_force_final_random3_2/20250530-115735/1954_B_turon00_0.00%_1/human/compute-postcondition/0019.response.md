Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 2, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases, since one test case has been processed.
