Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, cnt is 0, ans is n.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable cnt. The second line assigns the value of n to the variable ans. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state of the variables t, _, stdin, n, a, tmp, and aa remains unchanged. The final state includes the new variables cnt and ans with their assigned values.
