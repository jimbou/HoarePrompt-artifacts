The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, i is 2, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in the list a, cnt is 2 if a[i] is equal to tmp, otherwise cnt is 1 if a[i] is not equal to tmp but a[i-1] is equal to tmp, otherwise cnt is 0**
