Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer which is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**

The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be updated to be the minimum of its original value and 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
