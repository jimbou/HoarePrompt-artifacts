Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, cnt is 0, ans is n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` or t-2 test cases if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 2, if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1, otherwise `ans` is an integer and `cnt` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
