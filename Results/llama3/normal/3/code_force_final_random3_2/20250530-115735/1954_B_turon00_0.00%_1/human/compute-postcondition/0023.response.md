Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is n, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a` if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`. This update only occurs if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains unchanged.
