Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, `cnt` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties as specified in the initial state.
