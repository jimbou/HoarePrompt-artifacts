Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, i is 1, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in the list a, cnt is 2 if a[i] is equal to tmp, otherwise cnt is 1**

In this output state, the value of cnt has been incremented by 1. If a[i] is equal to tmp, then cnt is now 2, otherwise cnt is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
