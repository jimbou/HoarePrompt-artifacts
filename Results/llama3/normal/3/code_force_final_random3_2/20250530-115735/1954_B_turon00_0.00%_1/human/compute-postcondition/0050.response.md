To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, so we can only adjust the states of `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, and `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, we know that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt` which is 0 is being printed**
