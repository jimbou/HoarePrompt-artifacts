To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. 

Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is currently `n`, we need to adjust its state to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, `cnt` is 0**
