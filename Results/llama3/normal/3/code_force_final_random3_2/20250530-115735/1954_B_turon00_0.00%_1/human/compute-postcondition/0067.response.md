Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer which is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is either 3 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is now 3, otherwise it is either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
