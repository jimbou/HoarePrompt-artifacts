Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`***
