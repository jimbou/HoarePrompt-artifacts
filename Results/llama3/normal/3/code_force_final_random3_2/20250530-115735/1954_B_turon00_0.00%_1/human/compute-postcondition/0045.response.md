Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, i is 2, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in the list a, cnt is 3 if a[i] is equal to tmp, cnt is 2 if a[i] is not equal to tmp but a[i-1] is equal to tmp, cnt is 1 if a[i] is not equal to tmp and a[i-1] is not equal to tmp but a[i-2] is equal to tmp, otherwise cnt is 0.**
