Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3.  It checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking its length. If all elements are the same, it prints -1 as per the problem statement.
4.  If not all elements are the same, it initializes a variable `ans` to store the minimum length of a subsequence with the same number repeatedly. It also initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the current subsequence length.
5.  The program then iterates over the array, incrementing `cnt` when it encounters the same number as the first element `tmp`, and updating `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` when it encounters a different number. After the loop, it updates `ans` one more time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last subsequence.
6.  Finally, it prints the minimum length `ans` for each test case.

The execution states provided as comments match the expected behavior of the program, and the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
