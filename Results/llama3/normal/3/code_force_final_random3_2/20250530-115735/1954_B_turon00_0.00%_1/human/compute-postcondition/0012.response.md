Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, cnt is 0, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt, and i is 0.**

The first line assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum of its original value and 0. The second line assigns 0 to `cnt`. No other variables are affected.
