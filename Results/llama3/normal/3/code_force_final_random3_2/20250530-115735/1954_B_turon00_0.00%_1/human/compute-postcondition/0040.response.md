Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, i is 1, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in the list a, cnt is 0**

The code first updates the value of `ans` by taking the minimum of its original value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` will be either its original value or 0, depending on whether `cnt` is 0 or 1, respectively. Then, the value of `cnt` is reset to 0. No other variables are affected by the code.
