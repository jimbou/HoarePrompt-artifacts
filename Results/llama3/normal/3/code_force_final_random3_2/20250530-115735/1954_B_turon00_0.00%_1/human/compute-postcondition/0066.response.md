The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer which is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 2 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than 2**
