Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, i is 0, ans is the minimum of the original ans and 0, and cnt is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the minimum value between the original `ans` and `cnt` to `ans`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` becomes the minimum of its original value and 0, effectively setting `ans` to 0. The second line resets `cnt` to 0. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing `t-3` test cases.
