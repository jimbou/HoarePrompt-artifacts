The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n) that form a beautiful array.**
