Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, i is n, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in the list a, cnt is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `i`, which is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire list `a`. The value of `cnt` is reset to 0, as it is no longer needed after the loop finishes. The value of `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, which is the desired output.
