Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n) that form a beautiful array.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    aa = set(a)
    if len(aa) == 1:
        print(-1)
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is n, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a` if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt` which is 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer which is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, and the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt` which is 0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
