Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` or t-2 test cases if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is 2, if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1, otherwise `ans` is an integer and `cnt` is 0.***
