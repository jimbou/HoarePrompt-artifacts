Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer which is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` but is present in `aa`, or `cnt` is 0 if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` and not present in `aa`.**
