This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then analyzes each list to find the minimum length of a subsequence that contains the same number repeatedly. If all numbers in the list are the same, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of the subsequence. The function processes all test cases and prints the results for each case.
