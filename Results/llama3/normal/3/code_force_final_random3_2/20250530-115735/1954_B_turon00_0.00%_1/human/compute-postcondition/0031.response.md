Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), aa is a set of integers, i is n, ans is the minimum of the original ans and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of tmp in the list a, cnt is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sets the value of `cnt` to 0, and the second line sets the value of `ans` to `n`. 

The value of `cnt` is now 0. The value of `ans` is now `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive). 

The values of `t`, `_`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i` remain unchanged.
