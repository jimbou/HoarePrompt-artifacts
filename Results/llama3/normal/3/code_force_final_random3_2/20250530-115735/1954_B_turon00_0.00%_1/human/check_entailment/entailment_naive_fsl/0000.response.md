Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has more than two distinct elements. In this case, the program only checks the first distinct element and its count, but it does not consider the other distinct elements and their counts. 

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 2, 1], the program will only consider the count of the first distinct element (1) and its count, but it will not consider the count of the second distinct element (2) and its count. Therefore, the program will not give the correct answer in this case.

The correct approach is to find the minimum count of all distinct elements in the array, not just the first distinct element.
