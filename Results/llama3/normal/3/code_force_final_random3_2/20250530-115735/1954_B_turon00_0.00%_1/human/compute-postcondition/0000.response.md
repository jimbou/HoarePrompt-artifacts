The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The remaining input in the standard input is still present, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n) that form a beautiful array.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= n) that form a beautiful array.**
