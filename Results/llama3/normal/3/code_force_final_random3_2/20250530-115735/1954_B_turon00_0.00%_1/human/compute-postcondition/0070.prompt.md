Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), a is a list of n integers, tmp is an integer which is the first element of a, aa is a set of unique integers from a, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n, ans is the minimum of the original ans and cnt which is 0, cnt is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer which is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer which is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 2 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `tmp` is an integer which is the first element of `a`, `aa` is a set of unique integers from `a`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and `cnt`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` but is present in `aa`, or `cnt` is 0 if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp` and not present in `aa`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
