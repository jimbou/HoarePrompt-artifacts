Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of n integers, `tmp` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), `aa` is a set of integers, `i` is n. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates over the list `a` and keeps track of the number of consecutive occurrences of the value `tmp`. If the current element is equal to `tmp`, it increments the count `cnt`. If the current element is not equal to `tmp`, it resets the count `cnt` to 0 and updates the minimum value `ans` to be the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found so far. After the loop finishes, `i` is equal to `n`, and `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a`. If the last element is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`.
