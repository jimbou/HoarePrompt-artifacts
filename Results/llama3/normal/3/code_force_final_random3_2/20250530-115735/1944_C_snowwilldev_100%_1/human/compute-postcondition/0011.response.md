Output State: **`N` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `i` is 0, `t` is 1. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt[i]` is still 1, indicating that the count of the element at index `i` in the list `a` is 1.
