Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game. The program counts the occurrences of each number in the input list and returns the smallest number that has a count of at least 2 or is not present in the list. This is in line with the optimal strategy for both players, as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
