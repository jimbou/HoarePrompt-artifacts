Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i from 0 to N-1, i is N, t is either 1 or 2 if cnt[i] is 1 for some i, otherwise t is 0, and either t is less than 2 or cnt[i] is not equal to 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will terminate when it finds the first index `i` such that `cnt[i]` is either 0 or greater than 1, or when `t` becomes 2 or more. The value of `t` will be either 1 or 2 if `cnt[i]` is 1 for some `i`, otherwise it will be 0. The loop will iterate over all indices from 0 to `N-1`, and the state of the other variables `N`, `a`, and `cnt` remains unchanged.
