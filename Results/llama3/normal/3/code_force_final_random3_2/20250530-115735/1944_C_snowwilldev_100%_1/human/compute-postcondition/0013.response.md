Postcondition: **`N` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `i` is 0, the current value of `t` is either 0 or 1, and the current value of `t` is either greater than or equal to 2 or the current value of `cnt[i]` is 0.**
