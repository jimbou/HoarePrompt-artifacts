Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of N integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is 0**

In this output state, a new variable `t` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `N` is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is still a list of N integers, `cnt` is still a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is still increased by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, and `i` is still `N-1`.
