Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of N integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is 1 and `cnt[a[1]]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt[a[1]]` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The dictionary `cnt` now contains the updated count for the element at index 1 in the list `a`.
