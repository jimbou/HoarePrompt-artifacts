#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: `N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of N integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `i` is `N-1`.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i from 0 to N-1, i is N, t is either 1 or 2 if cnt[i] is 1 for some i, otherwise t is 0, and either t is less than 2 or cnt[i] is not equal to 0

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the smallest number that appears at least twice in the input list or is missing from the list. It takes a list of integers as input, counts the occurrences of each number, and returns the smallest number that has a count of at least 2 or is not present in the list. If no such number is found, it returns the length of the input list plus one.
