Functionality: **This function determines the smallest number that appears at least twice in the input list or is missing from the list. It takes a list of integers as input, counts the occurrences of each number, and returns the smallest number that has a count of at least 2 or is not present in the list. If no such number is found, it returns the length of the input list plus one.**
