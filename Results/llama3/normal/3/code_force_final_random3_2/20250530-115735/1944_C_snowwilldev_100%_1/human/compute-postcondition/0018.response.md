Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i from 0 to N-1, i is 1, if the current value of cnt[i] is 1, then t is 2, otherwise t is 1, and either t is less than 2 or cnt[i] is not equal to 0***
