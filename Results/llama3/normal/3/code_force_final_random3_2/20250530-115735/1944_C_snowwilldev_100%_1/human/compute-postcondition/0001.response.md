To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `N`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. If `N` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `N` is already given as an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, we can conclude that `N` is indeed at least 1.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we can adjust its state to `i` is 0.

The states of `a` and `cnt` are not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of N integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0, `i` is 0**
