The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[i]]` by 1. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. The value of `cnt[a[i]]` is initially 0, so after the increment, it becomes 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of N integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[0]]` is 1, `i` is 0**
