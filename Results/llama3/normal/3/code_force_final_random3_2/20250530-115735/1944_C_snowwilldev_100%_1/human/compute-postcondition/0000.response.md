Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0**.

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The variable N has been assigned an integer value between 1 and 2 * 10^4, which represents the number of test cases. The variable a is now a list of N integers, where each integer is between 0 and N-1. The variable cnt is a dictionary with a default value of 0, which means that any key that is not present in the dictionary will return 0 by default. The stdin is now empty, as the first two lines of the input have been consumed by the code.
