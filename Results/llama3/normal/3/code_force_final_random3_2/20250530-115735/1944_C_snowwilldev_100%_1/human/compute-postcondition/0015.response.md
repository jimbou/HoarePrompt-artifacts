Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of `N` integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `i` is 0, `t` is 1 if the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1, otherwise `t` remains 0, and either `t` is less than 2 or `cnt[i]` is not equal to 0***
