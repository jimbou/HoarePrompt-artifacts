Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, a is a list of N integers, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0 and cnt[a[i]] is increased by 1 for all i from 0 to N, i is 2, t is either 2 or 3, and either t is less than 3 or cnt[i] is not equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of t has been increased by 1. If the current value of cnt[i] is 1, then t was 2 and now it is 3. Otherwise, t was 1 and now it is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
