Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, `a` is a list of N integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `cnt[a[i]]` is increased by 1 for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `i` is `N-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `N` remains unchanged, the list `a` remains the same, and the dictionary `cnt` has been updated such that the count of each element in `a` has been incremented by 1. The loop variable `i` has reached its final value, which is `N-1`.
