Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, results is a list that contains the value of count, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y) which is equal to (rx, ry), freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (rx, ry) and the value is increased by 1, and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry].**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry], and the value of freq[rx, ry] is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
