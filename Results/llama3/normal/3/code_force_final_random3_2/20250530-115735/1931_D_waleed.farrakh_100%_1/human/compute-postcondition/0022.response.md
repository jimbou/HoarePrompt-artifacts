Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the second element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`, and `freq[current_pair]` is 1.**

In natural language, the code updates the value of `freq[current_pair]` to be 1, where `current_pair` is a tuple containing the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, which is equivalent to the values of `rx` and `ry`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
