Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four values: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The function does not modify the input test cases. The purpose of the function is to perform some operation on each test case and return the results. The final state of the program is that the results are printed to the console.**
