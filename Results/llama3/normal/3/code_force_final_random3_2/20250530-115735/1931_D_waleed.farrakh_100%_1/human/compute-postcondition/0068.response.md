Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, n is the first element of the third tuple in the list, x is the second element of the third tuple in the list, y is the third element of the third tuple in the list, arr is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least n+1 elements, a is the first element in the list arr, results is a list that contains the value of count and the value of count + freq[rx, ry] or count + freq[rx, ry] + 1 depending on whether current_pair is already in freq, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y), freq is an empty dictionary, and count is 0**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables other than `rx` and `ry`. The first line calculates the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, and assigns this value to `rx`. The second line calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `y` and assigns this value to `ry`. All other variables remain unchanged.
