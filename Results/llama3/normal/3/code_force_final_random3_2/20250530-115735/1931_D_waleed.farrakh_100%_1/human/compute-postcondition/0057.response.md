Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count + freq[rx, ry]`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (`rx`, `ry`) and the value is `freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, and the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains the updated value of `count`.
