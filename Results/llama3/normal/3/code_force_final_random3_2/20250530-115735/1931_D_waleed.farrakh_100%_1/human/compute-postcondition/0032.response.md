Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains key-value pairs where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the last element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, then the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` is empty, and the dictionary `freq` contains key-value pairs where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)` and the value is the frequency of the pair in the list `arr`. The variable `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise it is 0. The variables `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` are updated to their respective values based on the last element in the list `arr`.
