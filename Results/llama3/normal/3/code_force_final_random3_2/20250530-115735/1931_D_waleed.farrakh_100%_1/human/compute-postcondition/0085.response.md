Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+2` elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`). If (`rx`, `ry`) is already in `freq`, then `freq[(rx, ry)]` is increased by 1 and `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `freq` contains a new key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`) and the value 1, and `count` is 1.***
