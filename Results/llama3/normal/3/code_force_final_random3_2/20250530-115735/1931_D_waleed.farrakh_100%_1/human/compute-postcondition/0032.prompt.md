Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of positive integers, results is an empty list, freq is an empty dictionary, count is 0
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 2 elements, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the second element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, the frequency of `current_pair` in `freq` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the third element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, then the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
