Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` which is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `(rx, ry)` and the value is a positive integer, and `count` is a positive integer increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been increased by the frequency of the current pair `(rx, ry)` in the `freq` dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged. The `count` variable now holds a new value that is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of the current pair.
