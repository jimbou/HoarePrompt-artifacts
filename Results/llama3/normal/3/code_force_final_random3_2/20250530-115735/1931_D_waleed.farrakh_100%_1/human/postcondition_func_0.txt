This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing four values: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer divided by x and y, and counting the number of pairs that have the same remainder. The function returns a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the number of pairs found in each test case.
