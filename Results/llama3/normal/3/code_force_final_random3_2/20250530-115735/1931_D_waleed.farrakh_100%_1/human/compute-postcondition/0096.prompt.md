Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` which is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the last element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, then the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least `n` elements, `a` is the nth element in the list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry]` or `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (`rx`, `ry`) and the value is either `freq[rx, ry] + 1` or `freq[rx, ry] + 2` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`, and `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, n is the first element of the third tuple in the list, x is the second element of the third tuple in the list, y is the third element of the third tuple in the list, arr is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least n elements, a is the nth element in the list arr, results is a list that contains the value of count and the value of count + freq[rx, ry] + 1 and the value of count, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y), freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key (rx, ry), If (rx, ry) is already in freq, then freq[(rx, ry)] is increased by 1 and count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry]. Otherwise, freq contains a new key-value pair with the key (rx, ry) and the value 1, and count is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
