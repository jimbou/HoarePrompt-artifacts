Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is an empty list, results is a list that contains the value of count which is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is in freq, otherwise count is 0, a is the last element in the list, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y) which is equal to (rx, ry), freq is an empty dictionary, and count is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code only introduced two new variables, `freq` and `count`, which were initialized as an empty dictionary and 0, respectively.
