Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is 1.**

Explanation:
The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The first line of the input is converted to an integer and stored in the variable `t`. The variable `idx` is initialized to 1. The variable `test_cases` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected.
