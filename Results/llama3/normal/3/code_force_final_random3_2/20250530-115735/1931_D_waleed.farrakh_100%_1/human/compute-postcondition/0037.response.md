Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list, results is a list that contains the value of count which is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is in freq, otherwise count is 0, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y) which is equal to (rx, ry), freq is an empty dictionary, and count is 0**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables in the initial state. The first line calculates the value of `rx` as the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`. The second line calculates the value of `ry` as the remainder of `a` divided by `y`. However, these calculations do not affect the values of `rx` and `ry` because they are already defined in the initial state as the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and `y` respectively. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
