Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+2` elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`) and the value 1, `freq[current_pair]` is 1, `count` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, the values of n, x, y, and the array remain the same. The value of a is still the second element in the array. The results list still contains the count and the count plus the frequency of the pair (rx, ry) plus one. The values of rx and ry are still the remainders of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, and the remainder of a divided by y, respectively. The current pair is still the tuple (a mod x, a mod y). The frequency dictionary now contains a new key-value pair with the key (rx, ry) and the value 1. The count is now 1.
