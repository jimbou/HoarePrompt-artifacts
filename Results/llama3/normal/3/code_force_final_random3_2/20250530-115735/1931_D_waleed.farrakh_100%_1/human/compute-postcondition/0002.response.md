Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings, idx is 3, _ is 0**

The code block executes the following operations:

1. `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())`: This line assigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the `idx`-th element of the `data` list, which is a string containing three space-separated integers. The `map` function converts these strings to integers. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now positive integers.

2. `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))`: This line assigns the value of `arr` from the `(idx + 1)`-th element of the `data` list, which is a string containing a list of space-separated integers. The `map` function converts these strings to integers, and the `list` function converts the resulting map object to a list. The value of `arr` is now a list of positive integers.

3. `test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))`: This line appends a new tuple to the `test_cases` list. The tuple contains the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, which are now positive integers and a list of positive integers, respectively.

4. `idx += 2`: This line increments the value of `idx` by 2.

After executing these operations, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are positive integers, and `arr` is a list of positive integers.
* `t` is an integer greater than 0 (no change).
* `data` is a list of strings (no change).
* `idx` is 3 (incremented by 2).
* `_` is 0 (no change).

Note that the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are now specific positive integers and a list of positive integers, respectively, but their exact values depend on the input data.
