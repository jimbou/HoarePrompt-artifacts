Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, n is the first element of the third tuple in the list, x is the second element of the third tuple in the list, y is the third element of the third tuple in the list, arr is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list, a is the nth element in the list, results is a list that contains the value of count and the value of count + freq[rx, ry] or count + freq[rx, ry] + 1 depending on whether current_pair is already in freq, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y), freq is an empty dictionary, and count is 0
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+1` elements, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, then `freq[current_pair]` is `freq[rx, ry] + 1` and `count` is `freq[rx, ry] + 1`. Otherwise, `freq` contains a new key-value pair with the key `(rx, ry)` and the value 1, and `count` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+2` elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`). If (`rx`, `ry`) is already in `freq`, then `freq[(rx, ry)]` is increased by 1 and `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `freq` contains a new key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`) and the value 1, and `count` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+3` elements, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`). If (`rx`, `ry`) is already in `freq`, then `freq[(rx, ry)]` is increased by 1 and `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `freq` contains a new key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`) and the value 1, and `count` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
