Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, n is the first element of the third tuple in the list, x is the second element of the third tuple in the list, y is the third element of the third tuple in the list, arr is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least n+2 elements, a is the second element in the list arr, results is a list that contains the value of count and the value of count + freq[rx, ry] + 1, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y), freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key (rx, ry) and the value is increased by 1, count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry].**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, the values of n, x, y, and the list arr remain the same. The value of a is still the second element in the list arr. The results list still contains the value of count and the value of count + freq[rx, ry] + 1. The values of rx and ry are still the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, and the remainder of a divided by y, respectively. The current pair is still a tuple (a % x, a % y). The frequency dictionary still contains at least one key-value pair with the key (rx, ry), but the value is increased by 1. The count is also increased by the value of freq[rx, ry].
