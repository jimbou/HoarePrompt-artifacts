Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is 2*t + 1, _ is t - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the test_cases list will contain t number of tuples, each with four values: n, x, y, and arr. The values of n, x, y, and arr will be positive integers. The value of t will be greater than or equal to 0, indicating the number of iterations the loop has executed. The data list will remain unchanged, and the idx variable will be 2*t + 1, indicating the current index in the data list. The _ variable will be t - 1, indicating the number of iterations the loop has executed minus one.
