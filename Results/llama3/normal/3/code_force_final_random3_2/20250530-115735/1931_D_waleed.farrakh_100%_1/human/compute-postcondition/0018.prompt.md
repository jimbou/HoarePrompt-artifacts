Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is 2*t + 1, _ is t - 1
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is 2*t + 1, _ is t - 1, results is a list of results that must have at least 1 result, and the first result in the list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is 2*t + 1, `_` is t - 1, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 2 results, and the second result in the list which is results[1] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is 2*t + 1, `_` is t - 1, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 3 results, and the third result in the list which is results[2] is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
