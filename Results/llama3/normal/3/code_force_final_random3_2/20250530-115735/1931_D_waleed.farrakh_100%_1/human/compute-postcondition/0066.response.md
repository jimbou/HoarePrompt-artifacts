Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, n is the first element of the third tuple in the list, x is the second element of the third tuple in the list, y is the third element of the third tuple in the list, arr is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list, a is the nth element in the list, results is a list that contains the value of count and the value of count + freq[rx, ry] or count + freq[rx, ry] + 1 depending on whether current_pair is already in freq, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y), freq is an empty dictionary, and count is 0**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `freq` and sets `count` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The initial state remains the same, with the addition of `freq` being an empty dictionary and `count` being 0.
