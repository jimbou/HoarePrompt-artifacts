Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+3` elements, `a` is the third element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`), `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, the values of n, x, y, and the list arr remain the same. The value of a is still the third element in the list arr. The list results still contains the value of count and the value of count + freq[rx, ry] + 1. The values of rx and ry are still the same. The current pair is still the same. The frequency dictionary now has an increased value for the key current_pair by 1.
