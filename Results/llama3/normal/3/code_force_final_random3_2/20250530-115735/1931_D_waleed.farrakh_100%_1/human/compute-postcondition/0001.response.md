The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than 0, data is a list of strings, idx is 1, _ is 0**
