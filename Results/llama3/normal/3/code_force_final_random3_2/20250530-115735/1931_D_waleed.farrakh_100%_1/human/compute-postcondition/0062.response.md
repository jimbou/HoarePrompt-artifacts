Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (`rx`, `ry`) and the value is either `freq[rx, ry] + 1` or `freq[rx, ry] + 2` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, and `results` is a list that contains the value of `count + freq[rx, ry]` or `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`.**
