Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `(rx, ry)` and its value is 1, and `count` is a positive integer.**

In this output state, the value of `freq[current_pair]` has been updated to 1, indicating that the pair `(rx, ry)` is now present in the dictionary `freq` with a count of 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
