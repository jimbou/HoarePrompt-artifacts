Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+2` elements, `a` is the second element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key (`rx`, `ry`) and the value is increased by 1, `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The frequency of the current pair (`a % x`, `a % y`) is increased by 1. All other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
