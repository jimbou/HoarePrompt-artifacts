Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in the list, results is a list that contains the value of count, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y) which is equal to (rx, ry), freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (rx, ry), and count is a positive integer. If (rx, ry) is in freq, then count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] and the value of freq[rx, ry] is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of freq[rx, ry] is set to 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `rx` and `ry` based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The first line calculates the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, and assigns it to `rx`. The second line calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `y` and assigns it to `ry`. The values of `rx` and `ry` are then used to update the `current_pair` tuple and the `freq` dictionary. If the key `(rx, ry)` is already present in `freq`, the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is incremented by 1, and the value of `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. If the key is not present, the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is set to 1. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, and `results` remain unchanged.
