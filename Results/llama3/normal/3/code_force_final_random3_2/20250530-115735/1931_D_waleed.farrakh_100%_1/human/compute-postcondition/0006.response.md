Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than 2, data is a list of strings, idx is 7, _ is 2**

The code snippet modifies the initial state by executing the following operations:

1. The first line `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` assigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the `idx`-th element of the `data` list, which is a string containing three space-separated integers. This line updates the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` to be the integer values extracted from the string.

2. The second line `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))` assigns the value of `arr` from the `(idx + 1)`-th element of the `data` list, which is a string containing a list of space-separated integers. This line updates the value of `arr` to be the list of integer values extracted from the string.

3. The third line `test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))` appends a new tuple containing the updated values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list.

4. The fourth line `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2.

The final output state reflects the changes made by these operations:

* `test_cases` now contains an additional tuple with the updated values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
* `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` have been updated to their new values extracted from the `data` list.
* `idx` has been incremented by 2.
* The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Note that the specific values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not specified in the output state, as they depend on the contents of the `data` list, which is not provided.
