Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `(rx, ry)`, and `count` is a positive integer. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, then `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` and the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is set to 1.***
