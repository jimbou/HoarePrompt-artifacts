Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing four values: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer divided by x and y, and counting the number of pairs that have the same remainder. The function returns a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the number of pairs found in each test case.

func_2 reads the input from the standard input, parses it into a list of test cases, and calls func_1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results to the console.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array. It correctly calculates the remainder of each integer divided by x and y, and it correctly counts the number of pairs that have the same remainder. The program also correctly handles the input and output operations.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
