Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+1` elements, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry]` or `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key `(rx, ry)`, and `count` is `freq[rx, ry]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code increments the value of `count` by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, where `rx` and `ry` are calculated based on the value of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `count` is now equal to the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
