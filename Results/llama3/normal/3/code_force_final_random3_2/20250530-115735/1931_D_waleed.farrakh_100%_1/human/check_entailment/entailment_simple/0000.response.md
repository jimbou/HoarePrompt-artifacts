Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a, as defined in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input data and stores it in the `test_cases` list.
2. The `func_1` function correctly iterates over each tuple in `test_cases` and calculates the count of beautiful pairs for each tuple.
3. The `func_1` function correctly uses a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each pair of remainders `(a % x, a % y)` and updates the count accordingly.
4. The `func_1` function correctly returns the list of counts for each tuple in `test_cases`.
5. The `func_2` function correctly calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `x` or `y` is 1, and when the array `a` is empty.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
