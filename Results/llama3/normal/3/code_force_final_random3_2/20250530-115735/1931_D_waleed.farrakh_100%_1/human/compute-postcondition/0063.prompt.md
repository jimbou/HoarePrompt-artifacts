Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is an empty list, results is a list that contains the value of count which is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is in freq, otherwise count is 0, a is the last element in the list, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y) which is equal to (rx, ry), freq is an empty dictionary, and count is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in the list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `(rx, ry)`, and `count` is a positive integer. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, then `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` and the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `results` is a list that contains the value of count, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (`rx`, `ry`). If (`rx`, `ry`) is in `freq`, then count is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` and the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (`rx`, `ry`) and the value is either `freq[rx, ry] + 1` or `freq[rx, ry] + 2` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, and `results` is a list that contains the value of `count + freq[rx, ry]` or `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
