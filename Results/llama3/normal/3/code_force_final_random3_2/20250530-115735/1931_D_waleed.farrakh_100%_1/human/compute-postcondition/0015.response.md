The only variable in the loop head is variable  result, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 3 results the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 2 results, result is the second result in the list, which is results[1]. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 results and the result is the third result in the list.
State: **`results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is 2*t + 1, `_` is t - 1, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 3 results, and the third result in the list which is results[2] is being printed**
