Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in the list, `results` is a list that contains the value of count, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple (`a % x`, `a % y`), `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (`rx`, `ry`). If (`rx`, `ry`) is in `freq`, then count is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` and the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `freq[rx, ry]` is set to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of `current_pair` has been updated to be a tuple of the remainder of `a` divided by `x` and the remainder of `a` divided by `y`.
