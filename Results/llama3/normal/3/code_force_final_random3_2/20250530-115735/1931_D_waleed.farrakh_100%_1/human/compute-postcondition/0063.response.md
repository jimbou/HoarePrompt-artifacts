Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list that must have at least n elements, a is the nth element in the list, results is a list that contains the value of count, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y), freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (rx, ry) and the value is either freq[rx, ry] + 1 or freq[rx, ry] + 2 depending on whether current_pair is already in freq, count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry], and results is a list that contains the value of count + freq[rx, ry] or count + freq[rx, ry] + 1 depending on whether current_pair is already in freq.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` will have at least `n` elements, and the variable `a` will be the `n`th element in the list. The dictionary `freq` will contain at least one key-value pair where the key is `(rx, ry)` and the value is either `freq[rx, ry] + 1` or `freq[rx, ry] + 2` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`. The variable `count` will be increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`, and the list `results` will contain the value of `count + freq[rx, ry]` or `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1` depending on whether `current_pair` is already in `freq`.
