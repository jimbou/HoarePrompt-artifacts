Output State: **`results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is 2*t + 1, _ is t - 1**

In this output state, the value of `results` is determined by the return value of the function `func_1` when it is called with the argument `test_cases`. The values of the other variables, including `test_cases`, `t`, `data`, `idx`, and `_`, remain unchanged.
