To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means the loop iterates over the `results` list. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`
* `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr
* `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0
* `data` is a list of strings
* `idx` is 2*t + 1
* `_` is t - 1
* `results` is a list of results that must have at least 1 result
* The first result in the list is being printed

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the `results` list, as it is the only object in the loop head. Since the loop iterates over the `results` list, we need to ensure that there is at least one more result in the list for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is 2*t + 1, `_` is t - 1, `results` is a list of results that must have at least 2 results, and the second result in the list is being printed**

Note that we only adjusted the state of the `results` list, as it is the only object in the loop head. We did not modify the state of any other variables, as they are not part of the loop head.
