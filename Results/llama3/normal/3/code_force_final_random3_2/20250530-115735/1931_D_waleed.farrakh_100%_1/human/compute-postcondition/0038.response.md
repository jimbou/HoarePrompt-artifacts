Postcondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list that must have at least 1 element, a is the first element in the list, results is a list that contains the value of count which is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is in freq, otherwise count is 0, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y) which is equal to (rx, ry), freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (rx, ry) and the value is a positive integer, and count is a positive integer. The current value of rx and ry is such that (rx, ry) is a key in freq.**
