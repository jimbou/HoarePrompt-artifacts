Postcondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, results is an empty list, freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple (rx, ry), count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] if (rx, ry) is in freq, otherwise count is 0, a is the third element in the list, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, and current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y) which is equal to (rx, ry). If current_pair is in freq, the frequency of current_pair in freq is increased by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is 1.**
