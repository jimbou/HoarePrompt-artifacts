Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 3 elements, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is a tuple `(rx, ry)` and the value is increased by 1 if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the third element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`, and `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1 if `current_pair` is in `freq`, otherwise `freq[current_pair]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. This means that the frequency of the current pair `(rx, ry)` is incremented by 1 in the dictionary `freq`. All other variables remain unchanged.
