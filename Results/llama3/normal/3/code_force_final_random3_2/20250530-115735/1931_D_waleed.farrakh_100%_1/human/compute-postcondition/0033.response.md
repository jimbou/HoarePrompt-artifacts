Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` which is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the last element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, then the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is 1.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of `count` to the `results` list. The value of `count` is determined by the presence of the tuple `(rx, ry)` in the `freq` dictionary. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, then `count` is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `count` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
