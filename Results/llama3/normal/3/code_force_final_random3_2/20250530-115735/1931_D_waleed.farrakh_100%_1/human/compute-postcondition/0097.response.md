Output State: **The program returns the list 'results' which contains the count of pairs for each tuple in 'test_cases'.**

In this output state, the 'results' list contains the count of pairs for each tuple in 'test_cases'. The 'results' list is populated based on the processing of each tuple in 'test_cases', where the 'freq' dictionary is reset for each tuple, and the 'count' variable is updated accordingly. The 'a' variable takes on the value of the last element in the 'arr' list for each tuple in 'test_cases', and the 'rx' and 'ry' variables are calculated based on the last element in the 'arr' list for each tuple in 'test_cases'. The 'current_pair' variable is a tuple containing the remainder of the last element in the 'arr' list divided by 'x' and 'y', respectively.
