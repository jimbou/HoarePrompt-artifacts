Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in the list, `x` is the second element of the third tuple in the list, `y` is the third element of the third tuple in the list, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple in the list and must have at least `n+1` elements, `a` is the first element in the list `arr`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1` and the value of `count + freq[rx, ry] + 1`, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)`, `freq` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair with the key `(rx, ry)` and `freq[current_pair]` is `freq[rx, ry] + 1`, and `count` is `freq[rx, ry] + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, the values of n, x, y, and the array remain the same. The results list now contains the updated count value which is the previous count value plus the frequency of the current pair plus one. The values of rx, ry, and the current pair also remain the same. The frequency dictionary now has an updated value for the current pair, which is the previous frequency plus one. The count variable also has an updated value, which is the previous count plus one.
