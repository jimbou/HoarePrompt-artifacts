Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list that must have at least 3 elements, a is the third element in the list, results is a list that contains the value of count, rx is the remainder of the negative of a divided by x plus x, then divided by x, ry is the remainder of a divided by y, current_pair is a tuple (a % x, a % y), freq is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is (rx, ry). If (rx, ry) is in freq, then count is increased by the value of freq[rx, ry] and the value of freq[rx, ry] is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of freq[rx, ry] is set to 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `rx` and `ry` based on the values of `a`, `x`, and `y`. The new values of `rx` and `ry` are calculated using the modulo operator (`%`). The remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x` is calculated and then divided by `x` to get the new value of `rx`. Similarly, the remainder of `a` divided by `y` is calculated to get the new value of `ry`. The values of `rx` and `ry` are then used to update the `freq` dictionary and the `results` list. The `current_pair` tuple is also updated with the new values of `rx` and `ry`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
