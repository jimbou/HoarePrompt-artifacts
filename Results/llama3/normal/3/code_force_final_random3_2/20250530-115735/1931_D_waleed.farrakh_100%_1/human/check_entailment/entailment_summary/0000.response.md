Reasoning: 
The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices is considered beautiful if the sum of the elements at those indices is divisible by x and the difference is divisible by y. The provided functions, func_1 and func_2, work together to solve this problem.

func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains the size of the array, the favorite integers x and y, and the array elements. It processes each test case by iterating over the array elements, calculating the remainder of each element divided by x and y, and counting the number of pairs that have the same remainder. The function returns a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the number of beautiful pairs found in each test case.

func_2 reads the input from the console, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results to the console.

The provided execution summaries for func_1 and func_2 match the expected behavior based on the problem description. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
