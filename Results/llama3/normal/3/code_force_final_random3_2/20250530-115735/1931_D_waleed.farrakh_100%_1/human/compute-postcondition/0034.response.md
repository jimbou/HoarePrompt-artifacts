The only objects in the loop head are variables  `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr` and list  `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least one tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 tuples and n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is an empty list.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count` which is increased by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` is 0, `a` is the last element in the list, `rx` is the remainder of the negative of `a` divided by `x` plus `x`, then divided by `x`, `ry` is the remainder of `a` divided by `y`, and `current_pair` is a tuple `(a % x, a % y)` which is equal to `(rx, ry)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, then the value of `freq[current_pair]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `freq[current_pair]` is 1.**
