According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 1 result the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is 2*t + 1, _ is t - 1. So for the loop to be executed  the results must have at least 1 result and the result is the first result in the list.
State: **`results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings, idx is 2*t + 1, _ is t - 1, results is a list of results that must have at least 1 result, result is the first result in the list**
