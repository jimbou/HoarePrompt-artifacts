Output State: **`results` is returned and is equal to the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is 2*t + 1, `_` is t - 1, `results` is a list of results that must have at least as many results as the length of `results`, and all results in the list are printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the `results` list will have been fully processed, and all its elements will have been printed. The other variables (`test_cases`, `t`, `data`, `idx`, and `_`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
