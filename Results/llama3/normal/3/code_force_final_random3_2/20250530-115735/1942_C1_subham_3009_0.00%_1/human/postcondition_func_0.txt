This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the value of x - 2 for each test case if the program is run as the main module, otherwise, it does nothing. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to calculate and print the value of x - 2 for each test case, where x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The final state of the program after it concludes is that the value of x - 2 is printed for each test case, and stdin is empty.
