Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The key insight is that the number of triangular pieces is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2. This is because each pair of chosen vertices can form a diagonal, and each diagonal can be used to create a triangle with one of the remaining vertices.

The program correctly reads the input, extracts the relevant information, and prints the result. The logic is straightforward and easy to follow. The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle.

In particular, the program correctly handles the case where y = 0, which means that no additional vertices can be chosen. In this case, the program simply prints the number of chosen vertices minus 2, which is the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
