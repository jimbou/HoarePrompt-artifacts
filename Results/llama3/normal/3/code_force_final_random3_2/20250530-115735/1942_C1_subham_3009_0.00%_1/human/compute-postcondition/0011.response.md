Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t-3 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the value of x - 2 is being printed.**

The code snippet provided modifies the initial state in the following ways:

1. `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1, so `t` is now an integer between 0 and 10^4.

2. `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` reads the next line from stdin, which contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`. This line modifies the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` to the newly read values. Since the precondition states that `n` is between 4 and 10^9, `x` is between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is 0, these conditions still hold after the modification.

3. `arr = input().split()` reads the next line from stdin, which contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. This line assigns these integers to `arr` as a list of strings.

4. `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` converts each string in `arr` to an integer. This line modifies `arr` to be a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

After the execution of the code snippet, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4.
- `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9.
- `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5).
- `y` is 0.
- `arr` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- stdin contains `t-3` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and the value of `x - 2` is being printed.
