Postcondition: ***stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. If t is 0, stdin contains no test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the value of x - 2 is being printed.***
