Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1. The second line reads the first line of the first test case from stdin and assigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` to the corresponding variables. The third line reads the second line of the first test case from stdin, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer. The list of integers is then assigned to the variable `arr`. 

The value of `t` is reduced by 1, and the first test case is read from stdin. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are set based on the input, and the list of integers is stored in `arr`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.
