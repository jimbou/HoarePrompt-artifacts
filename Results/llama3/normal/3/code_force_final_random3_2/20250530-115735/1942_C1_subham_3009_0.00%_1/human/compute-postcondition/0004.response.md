Based on the precondition, the value of `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), where n is an integer between 4 and 10^9.

When the print statement `print(x - 2)` is executed, it will print the value of `x` minus 2.

Since `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), the value of `x - 2` will be an integer between 0 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) - 2.

Therefore, the output will be an integer between 0 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) - 2.

Output: **an integer between 0 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) - 2 (where n is an integer between 4 and 10^9)**
