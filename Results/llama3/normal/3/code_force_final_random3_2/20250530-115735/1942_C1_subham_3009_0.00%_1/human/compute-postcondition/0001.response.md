The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. 

So, after executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, and stdin now contains `t` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
