Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers n, x, and y, and then reads x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then prints the value of x - 2. The function repeats this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input contains no more test cases. The function does not modify the input values or perform any calculations beyond printing the value of x - 2.**
