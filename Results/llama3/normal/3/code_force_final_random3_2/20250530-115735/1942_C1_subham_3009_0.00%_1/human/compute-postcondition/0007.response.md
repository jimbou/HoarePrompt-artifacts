Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, and the values of n, x, and y have been updated based on the input from stdin. The list arr now contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of two lines as described in the initial state.
