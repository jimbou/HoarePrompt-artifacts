Output State: **t is 0, stdin contains no test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the value of x - 2 is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the initial execution state has been fully consumed. The loop counter `t` has reached 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The input stream `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been read and processed. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their last values from the input, and the list `arr` contains the last set of distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `x - 2` is being printed, which is an integer between 0 and `min(n, 2 * 10^5) - 2`.
