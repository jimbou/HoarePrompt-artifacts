Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, y is 1, current_sum is the sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y and y, max_sum is either updated to current_sum if current_sum is greater than max_sum or remains unchanged, best_y is either updated to y if current_sum is greater than max_sum or remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of gcd_val is updated to the greatest common divisor of x and y, and the value of current_sum is updated to the sum of gcd_val and y. The values of max_sum and best_y are updated only if current_sum is greater than max_sum. The other variables remain unchanged.
