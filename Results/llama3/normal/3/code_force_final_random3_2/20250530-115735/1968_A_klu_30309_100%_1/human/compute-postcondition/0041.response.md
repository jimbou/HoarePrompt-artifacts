Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 2, gcd_val is 1, y is 1, if current_sum is larger than max_sum, max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is set to 1. Otherwise, max_sum remains 0 and best_y remains 1.***
