Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1
Code of the loop:
for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
    gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
    current_sum = gcd_val + y
    if current_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = current_sum
        best_y = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is at least 1, y is x - 1. If the current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to the previous value of current_sum, best_y is updated to the previous value of y which is x - 1, and the previous value of current_sum is greater than the new max_sum which is at least 3. Otherwise, the values of max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 2. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is set to y.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 3, if current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is updated to y, otherwise max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
