Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `y` is 0, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished iterating over all elements in the `test_cases` list, and the `results` list contains the value of `best_y` for each element in `test_cases`. The loop variables `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` have their final values after the last iteration of the loop.
