Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and 1, y is 1, max_sum is the maximum sum of gcd_val and y for all y in range(x - 1, 0, -1), best_y is the value of y that produces max_sum.**

The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is characterized by the following conditions:

*   `t` remains a positive integer.
*   `test_cases` remains a list of integers with at least two elements, where each element is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
*   `results` contains the value of `best_y`.
*   `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and is at least 2.
*   `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1.
*   `y` is 1.
*   `max_sum` is the maximum sum of `gcd_val` and `y` for all `y` in the range from `x - 1` to 1 (in reverse order).
*   `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.

In summary, after the loop completes all its iterations, `y` will be 1, and `max_sum` and `best_y` will hold the maximum sum and the corresponding `y` value, respectively, found during the iterations. The other variables remain unchanged.
