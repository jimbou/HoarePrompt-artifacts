Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is at least 1, y is x - 1. If the current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to the previous value of current_sum, best_y is updated to the previous value of y which is x - 1, and the previous value of current_sum is greater than the new max_sum which is at least 3. Otherwise, the values of max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.***
