Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `max_sum` and `best_y`, and assigns them the values 0 and 1, respectively. The rest of the variables in the initial state remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still a positive integer, `test_cases` is still a list of integers with at least one element, and `results` is still an empty list. The value of `x` is still the first element in `test_cases`.
