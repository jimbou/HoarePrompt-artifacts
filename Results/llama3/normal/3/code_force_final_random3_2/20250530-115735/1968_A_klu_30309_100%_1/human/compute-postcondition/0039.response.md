Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 2, gcd_val is 1, y is 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1, and the current value of current_sum is greater than the current value of max_sum which is 0, so current_sum is at least 1.**
