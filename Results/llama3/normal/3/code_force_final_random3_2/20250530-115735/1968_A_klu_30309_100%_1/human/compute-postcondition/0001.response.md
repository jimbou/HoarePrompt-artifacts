To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `test_cases`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `test_cases` is not empty. Since `t` is a positive integer and `len(test_cases)` == `t`, we can infer that `test_cases` must have at least one element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`**
