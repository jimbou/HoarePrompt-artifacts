To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `y`, and the loop condition depends on the range defined by `x - 1` and `0`, with a step of `-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `t` is a positive integer
* `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`
* `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that produces `max_sum`
* `x` is at least 2
* `gcd_val` is 1
* `y` is 1
* If `current_sum` is larger than `max_sum`, `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `best_y` is set to 1. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains 0 and `best_y` remains 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop condition. Since the loop iterates from `x - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`, the next value of `y` should be `y - 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that produces `max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `y` is 0**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `y`, as it is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be updated for the loop to execute again.
