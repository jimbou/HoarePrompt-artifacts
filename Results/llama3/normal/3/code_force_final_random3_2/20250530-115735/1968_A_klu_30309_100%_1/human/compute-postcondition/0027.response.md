Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, y is x - 2, max_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, best_y is y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `x`, `gcd_val`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `max_sum` is updated to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, which is the same as the value of `current_sum`. The value of `best_y` is updated to be `y`. The `results` list now contains the value of `best_y`, which is `y`.
