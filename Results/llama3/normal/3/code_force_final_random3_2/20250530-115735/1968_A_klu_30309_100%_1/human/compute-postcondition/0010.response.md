Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 2, max_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, best_y is y.**

In this output state, the values of t, test_cases, results, x, gcd_val, current_sum, and y remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces two new variables, max_sum and best_y, which are assigned the values of current_sum and y, respectively.
