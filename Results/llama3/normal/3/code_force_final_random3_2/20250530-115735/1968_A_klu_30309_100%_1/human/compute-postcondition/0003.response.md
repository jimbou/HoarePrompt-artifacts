To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is greater than 1, because the range starts from `x - 1` and goes down to 0. Since `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, we can infer that `x` must be at least 2 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `y` is x - 1**
