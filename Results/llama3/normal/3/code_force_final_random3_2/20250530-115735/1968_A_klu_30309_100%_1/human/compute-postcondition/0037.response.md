To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 1, since the range starts from `x - 1` and goes down to `0`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be greater than 1.

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and 1, y is 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1**
