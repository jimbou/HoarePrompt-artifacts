To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only object in the loop head is the variable `x` and the list `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If the list has at least two elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least one element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and is at least 2.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `test_cases` must have at least two elements and `x` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, `y` is 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` obtained during the loop iterations, `best_y` is the value of `y` that corresponds to the maximum value of `current_sum`.**
