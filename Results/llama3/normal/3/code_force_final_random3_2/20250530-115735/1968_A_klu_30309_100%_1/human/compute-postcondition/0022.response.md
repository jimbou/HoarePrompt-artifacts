Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1. The current value of current_sum is higher than max_sum***
