Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 3, max_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, best_y is y.**

The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`, effectively updating `max_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. Since `current_sum` is already the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, this line does not change the value of `max_sum`. The second line assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`, but since `y` is already the value that made `current_sum` greater than the previous value of `max_sum`, `best_y` remains the same as `y`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected by the code.
