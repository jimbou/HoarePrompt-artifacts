Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 3, max_sum is the maximum of its previous value and current_sum, best_y is y if current_sum is greater than max_sum's previous value.**

The code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Then, it calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
