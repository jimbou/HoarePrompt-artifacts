Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, max_sum is equal to the previous value of current_sum, best_y is equal to the previous value of y which is x - 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is at least 1, and the previous value of current_sum is greater than the new max_sum which is at least 3.**

In this output state, the value of `max_sum` has been updated to the previous value of `current_sum`, which is at least 3. The value of `best_y` has been updated to the previous value of `y`, which is `x - 1`. The value of `y` remains unchanged as `x - 1`. The value of `gcd_val` remains at least 1. The value of `current_sum` is greater than the new `max_sum`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `x` remain unchanged.
