The only variable in the loop head is variable  x and list test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that produces `max_sum`, `x` is the third element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `y` is 1, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of `gcd_val` and `y` for all `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.**
