Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and `len(test_cases)` == `t`, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, `y` is 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` obtained during the loop iterations, `best_y` is the value of `y` that corresponds to the maximum value of `current_sum`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that produces `max_sum`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `y` is 1, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of `gcd_val` and `y` for all `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that produces `max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `y` is 0, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`, and `results` now contains an additional element which is the value of `best_y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
