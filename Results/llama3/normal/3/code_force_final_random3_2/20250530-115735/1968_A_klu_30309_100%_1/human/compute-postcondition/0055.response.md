Functionality: **This function takes a list of integers (test_cases) as input, where each integer is between 2 and 1000, and returns a list of integers (results) where each integer is the value of y that produces the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y, and y, for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1), for each x in test_cases. The function iterates over each x in test_cases, calculates the maximum sum for each x, and appends the corresponding y value to the results list. The function returns the results list.**
