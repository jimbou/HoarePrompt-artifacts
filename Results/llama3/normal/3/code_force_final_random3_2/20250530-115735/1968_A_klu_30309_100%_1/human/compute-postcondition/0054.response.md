Output State: **The program returns a list containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, where `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), and `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and is at least 2.**
