Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, y is x - 3, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, max_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, best_y is x - 3.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `gcd_val`, `y`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`, so `max_sum` becomes the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. Additionally, the code assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`, so `best_y` becomes `x - 3`.
