Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, y is 1, current_sum is the sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y and y, max_sum is the sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y and y, best_y is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` have been updated. `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, which is the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y`. Since `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is also 1, and `current_sum` is 2. Therefore, `max_sum` is 2. `best_y` is updated to `y`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
