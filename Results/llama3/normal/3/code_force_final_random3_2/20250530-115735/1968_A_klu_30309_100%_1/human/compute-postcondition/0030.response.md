Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, y is x - 3, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y.**

The code snippet calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Then, it calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The value of `gcd_val` is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and the value of `current_sum` is updated to the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`.
