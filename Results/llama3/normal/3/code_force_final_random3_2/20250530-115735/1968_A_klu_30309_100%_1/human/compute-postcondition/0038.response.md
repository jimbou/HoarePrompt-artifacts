Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 2, gcd_val is 1, y is 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1, current_sum is 2**

The code snippet modifies the values of `gcd_val` and `current_sum`. The `gcd_val` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, which is 1 since `y` is 1. The `current_sum` is calculated as the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, resulting in 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
