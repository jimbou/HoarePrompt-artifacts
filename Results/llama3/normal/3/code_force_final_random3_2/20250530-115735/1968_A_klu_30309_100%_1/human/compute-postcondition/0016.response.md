Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is 1, max_sum is the maximum value of current_sum obtained during the loop iterations, best_y is the value of y that corresponds to the maximum value of current_sum.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has iterated over all possible values of y from x-1 down to 1, and has kept track of the maximum value of the sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y, and y itself. The final values of max_sum and best_y are the maximum value of this sum and the corresponding value of y, respectively. The other variables, t, test_cases, and results, remain unchanged.
