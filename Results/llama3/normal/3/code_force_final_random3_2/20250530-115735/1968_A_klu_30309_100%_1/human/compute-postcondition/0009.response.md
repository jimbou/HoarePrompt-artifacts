Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` is still the first element in `test_cases` and is at least 2. The value of `gcd_val` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, which is calculated using the `math.gcd()` function. The value of `current_sum` is the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. The value of `y` is still `x - 2`.
