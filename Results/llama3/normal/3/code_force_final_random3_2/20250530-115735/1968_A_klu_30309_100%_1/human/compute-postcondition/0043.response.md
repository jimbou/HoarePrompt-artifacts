Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 2, gcd_val is 1, y is 0, current_sum is 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `gcd_val` is updated to 1, which is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. The value of `current_sum` is calculated as the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, resulting in 1.
