Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and `len(test_cases)` == `t`, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `test_cases` remains the same as in the initial state. However, a new variable `results` is introduced and assigned an empty list. This means that `results` is now a part of the program's state, and it is ready to store values in the future.
