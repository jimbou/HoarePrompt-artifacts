Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 2, gcd_val is 1, y is 0, current_sum is 1. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to 1 and best_y is updated to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
