To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The objects involved are `y`, `x`, and the `range` object.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `x - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by 1, since the `range` object is decrementing by 1 in each iteration.

The value of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.

The `range` object is already defined with the initial values, so no adjustments are needed.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is at least 1, `y` is `x - 2`.**

Note that I've updated the value of `y` to `x - 2`, as it is decremented by 1 from its previous value of `x - 1`.
