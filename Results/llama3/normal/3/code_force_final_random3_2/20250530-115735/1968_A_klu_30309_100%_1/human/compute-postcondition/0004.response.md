The code calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` and assigns it to `gcd_val`. Then, it calculates the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` and assigns it to `current_sum`. 

Since `x` is at least 2 and `y` is `x - 1`, `y` is at least 1. The gcd of `x` and `y` is at least 1, so `gcd_val` is at least 1. Therefore, `current_sum` is at least 2.

The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `max_sum`, and `best_y` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1, y is x - 1, gcd_val is at least 1, current_sum is at least 2**
