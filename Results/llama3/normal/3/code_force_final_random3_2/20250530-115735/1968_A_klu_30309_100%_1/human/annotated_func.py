    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `y` is 0, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list containing the value of `best_y` for each `x` in `test_cases`, where `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), and `x` is the last element in `test_cases` and is at least 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers (test_cases) as input, where each integer is between 2 and 1000, and returns a list of integers (results) where each integer is the value of y that produces the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y, and y, for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1), for each x in test_cases. The function iterates over each x in test_cases, calculates the maximum sum for each x, and appends the corresponding y value to the results list. The function returns the results list.
