Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 3, if current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is updated to y, otherwise max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.***
