Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that produces `max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `y` is 0, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`, and `results` now contains an additional element which is the value of `best_y`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, but the `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the value of `best_y` that produces the maximum sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` for `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1).
