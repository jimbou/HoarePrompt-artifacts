Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the first element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, `y` is 1, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` obtained during the loop iterations, `best_y` is the value of `y` that corresponds to the maximum value of `current_sum`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `best_y` has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
