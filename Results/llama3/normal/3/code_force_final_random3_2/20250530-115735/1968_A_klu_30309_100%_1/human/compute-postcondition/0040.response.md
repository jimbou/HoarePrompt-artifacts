Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 2, gcd_val is 1, y is 1, max_sum is at least 1 and equal to current_sum, best_y is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum` and the value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `current_sum` is at least 1, `max_sum` becomes at least 1. The value of `y` is 1, so `best_y` also becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code.
