Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is the third element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and 1, y is 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1**

The code snippet resets the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` to 0 and 1, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `max_sum` is now 0, and the value of `best_y` is now 1. All other variables retain their original values.
