To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `y` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `x - 1`, and `x` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` becomes `x - 2`. The value of `x` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged**
