Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y` and the value of `best_y` that produces `max_sum`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, `y` is 1, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of `gcd_val` and `y` for all `y` in range(`x` - 1, 0, -1), `best_y` is the value of `y` that produces `max_sum`.**

In this output state, the value of `best_y` has been appended to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains two values: the original value of `best_y` and the new value of `best_y` that produces `max_sum`.
