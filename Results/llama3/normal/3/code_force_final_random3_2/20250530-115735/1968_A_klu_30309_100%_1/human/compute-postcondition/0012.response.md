The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is x - 2. For the loop to execute again, y must be decreased by 1, so y is x - 3.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least one element such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is an empty list, x is the first element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is x - 3. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is set to y.**
