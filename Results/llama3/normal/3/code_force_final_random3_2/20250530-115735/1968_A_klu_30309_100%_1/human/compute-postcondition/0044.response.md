Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 2, gcd_val is 1, y is 0, current_sum is 1, max_sum is 1, best_y is 0**

The code snippet consists of three lines: `max_sum = current_sum`, `best_y = y`, and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. Since `current_sum` is 1, `max_sum` becomes 1. The second line assigns the value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `y` is 0, `best_y` becomes 0. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state is preserved for all variables except `max_sum` and `best_y`, which are updated according to the code. The final state includes the updated values of `max_sum` and `best_y`, as well as the unchanged values of all other variables.
