Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least three elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y and the value of best_y that produces max_sum, x is at least 3, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, y is 1, current_sum is the sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y and y. If current_sum is greater than max_sum, then max_sum is updated to current_sum and best_y is updated to 1. Otherwise, max_sum and best_y remain unchanged.***
