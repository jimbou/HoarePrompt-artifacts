Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in test_cases, results is a list containing the value of best_y, x is the second element in test_cases and is at least 2, gcd_val is the greatest common divisor of x and y, current_sum is the sum of gcd_val and y, y is 1, max_sum is 0, best_y is 1.**

The code snippet provided resets the values of `max_sum` and `best_y` to 0 and 1, respectively. The initial state's values for `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `x`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, and `y` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. The `max_sum` and `best_y` variables are updated to 0 and 1, respectively, as per the code.
