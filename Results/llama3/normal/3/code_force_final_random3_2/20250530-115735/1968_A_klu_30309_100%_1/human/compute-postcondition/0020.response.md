To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is at least 2, which is already given in the initial state. However, we need to adjust the state of `y` to be within the range of `x - 1` to `0` (exclusive) for the loop to execute.

Since `y` is currently 1, we can adjust it to be `x - 1` to ensure the loop executes. This is because the loop will iterate from `x - 1` down to `0` (exclusive), and `y` needs to be within this range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers with at least two elements such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `best_y`, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and is at least 2, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`, `y` is `x - 1`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1**
