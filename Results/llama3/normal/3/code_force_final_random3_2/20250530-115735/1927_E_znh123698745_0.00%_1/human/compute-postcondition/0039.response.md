State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1, array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even. a is a list containing the integers 1 and either -n if i is odd or 1 if i is even, or 2 and either -n+1 if i is odd or 0 if i is even. stdin is empty, and i is either an odd number greater than or equal to n-1 or n-1. If i is odd, a[0] is either 0 or 1 and answer contains array[a[0]]. If i is even, a[0] is either n-1 or n and answer contains array[a[0]]. The list answer is being printed, where answer contains the integers 1, array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even.**
