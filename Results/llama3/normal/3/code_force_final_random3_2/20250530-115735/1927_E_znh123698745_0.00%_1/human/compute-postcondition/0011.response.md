Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, _ is 0, stdin is empty, and i is an odd number greater than 1. If (-1) ** i == -1, then answer is a list containing the integers 1, the last element of array, and the second last element of array, and a is a list containing the integers 1 and -3. Otherwise, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and either the last element of array if i is odd or 2 if i is even and the second element of array, and a is a list containing the integers 2 and either -2 if i is odd or -1 if i is even.***
