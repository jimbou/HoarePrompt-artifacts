Output State: **n is an integer greater than i, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1, array[a[-1]], and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, a is a list containing the integers 1 and either -3 if i is odd or 1 if i is even, _ is 1, stdin is empty, and i is either an even number greater than or equal to 2 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `answer` has been modified by appending the value of `array[a[-1]]` to it. The value of `a[-1]` has been decremented by 1, affecting the value of `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
