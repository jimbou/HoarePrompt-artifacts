Output State: **n is an integer greater than the new value of i, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin is empty, i is incremented by 1 from its previous value, answer has been appended with the value at index a[-1] in array, and a[-1] has been decremented by 1.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

* The first line appends the value at index `a[-1]` in `array` to `answer`. This means that `answer` now contains an additional element, which is the value at the last index of `a` in `array`.
* The second line decrements the value of `a[-1]` by 1. This means that the last element of `a` has been reduced by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged. `n` is still an integer greater than the new value of `i`, `k` is still an integer, `array` is still a list of integers from 1 to `n`, and `stdin` is still empty. `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, but this change is not directly related to the code snippet.
