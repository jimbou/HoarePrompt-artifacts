This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers: n and k. It generates a list of integers from 1 to n, then rearranges this list in a specific order (1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n/2, n/2+1 if n is even or (n+1)/2, (n+1)/2 if n is odd) and prints this rearranged list. The function repeats this process for each test case, until all input has been processed and standard input is empty.
