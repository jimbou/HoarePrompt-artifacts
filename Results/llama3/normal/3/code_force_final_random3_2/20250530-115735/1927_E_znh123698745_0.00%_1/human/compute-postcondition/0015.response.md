Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is an odd number greater than the previous odd number. If (-1) ** i equals -1, a[-1] is decreased by 1 and answer is appended with the value of array[a[-1]]. Otherwise, answer is appended with the value of array[a[0]] and a[0] is incremented by 1.***
