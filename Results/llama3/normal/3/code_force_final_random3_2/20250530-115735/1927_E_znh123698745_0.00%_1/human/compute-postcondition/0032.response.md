Output State: **n is an integer greater than i, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1, array[a[-1]], array[a[-1]], and array[a[-1]], a is a list containing the integers 1 and either -4 if i is odd or 0 if i is even, _ is 1, stdin is empty, and i is either an odd number greater than or equal to 3 or 3.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than `i`. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as an integer. The `array` still contains a list of integers from 1 to `n`. The `answer` list now contains four elements: the integer 1, and three instances of `array[a[-1]]`, which is either `array[-3]` if `i` is odd or `array[1]` if `i` is even. The `a` list now contains the integers 1 and either -4 if `i` is odd or 0 if `i` is even. The value of `_` remains unchanged as 1. The `stdin` remains empty. The value of `i` remains unchanged as either an odd number greater than or equal to 3 or 3.
