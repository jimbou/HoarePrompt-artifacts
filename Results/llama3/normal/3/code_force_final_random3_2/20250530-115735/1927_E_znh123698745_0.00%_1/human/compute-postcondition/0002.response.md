To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1, and we can set `i` to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**
