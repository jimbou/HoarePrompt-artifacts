To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is 1**
