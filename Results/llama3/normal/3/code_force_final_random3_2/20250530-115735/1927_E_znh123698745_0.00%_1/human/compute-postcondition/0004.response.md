The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `array[a[-1]]` to the `answer` list. Since `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -1, and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, the value appended to `answer` is the integer at index -1 in `array`, which is the last element of `array`. The second line decrements the last element of `a` by 1, making it -2.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and the last element of array, a is a list containing the integers 1 and -2, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is 1.**
