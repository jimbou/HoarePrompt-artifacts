Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is an odd number, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and the last element of `array`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2. If `i` is an even number, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and the integer at index 1 in `array`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 2 and -1.***
