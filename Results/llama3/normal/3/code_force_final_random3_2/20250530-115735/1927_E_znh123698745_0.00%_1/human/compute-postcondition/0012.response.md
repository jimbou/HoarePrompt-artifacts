To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is an odd number greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 2 to make it the next odd number.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`k`, `array`, `_`, `stdin`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is an odd number greater than the previous odd number**
