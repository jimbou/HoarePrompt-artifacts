The code prints the elements of the `answer` list, which contains the integers from 1 to `n` in a specific order. The order is determined by the value of `n`, which is an integer greater than 0.

If `n` is even, the order is: 1, `n`, 2, `n-1`, 3, `n-2`, ..., `n/2`, `n/2+1`.

If `n` is odd, the order is: 1, `n`, 2, `n-1`, 3, `n-2`, ..., `(n+1)/2`, `(n+1)/2`.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the elements of the `answer` list and print them separated by spaces.

Output: **1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n/2, n/2+1 (if n is even) or 1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., (n+1)/2, (n+1)/2 (if n is odd)**
