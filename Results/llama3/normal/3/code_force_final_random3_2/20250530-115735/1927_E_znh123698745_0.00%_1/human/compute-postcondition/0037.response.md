Output: **1, array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even (where array is a list of integers from 1 to n, a[-1] is either -n if i is odd or 1 if i is even, and i is either an odd number greater than or equal to n-1 or n-1)**
