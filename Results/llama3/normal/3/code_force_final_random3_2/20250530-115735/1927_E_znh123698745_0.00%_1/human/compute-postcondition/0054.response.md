Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than the new value of i, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, stdin is empty, i is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If (-1) ** i == -1, then answer has been appended with the value at index a[-1] in array, and a[-1] has been decremented by 1. Otherwise, answer contains the value of array[a[0]], a[0] is incremented by 1 from its previous value.***
