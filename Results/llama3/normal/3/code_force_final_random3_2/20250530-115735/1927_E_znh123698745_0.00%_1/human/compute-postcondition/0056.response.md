Based on the precondition, the `answer` list contains the integers 1 and all the elements of the `array` in reverse order. Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, the reversed list will be from `n` to 1.

The `print(*answer)` statement will unpack the `answer` list and print its elements separated by spaces.

Output: **1, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2, 1**
