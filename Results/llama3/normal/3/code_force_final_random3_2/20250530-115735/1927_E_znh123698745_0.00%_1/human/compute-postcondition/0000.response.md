The only variables in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases), which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases) that is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
