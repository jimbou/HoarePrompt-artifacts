The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either an odd number greater than or equal to 1 or 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. So `i` is either an even number greater than or equal to 2 or 2 and `n` is an integer greater than `i`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than `i`, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and either `array[a[-1]]` if `i` is odd or `array[1]` if `i` is even, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and either -2 if `i` is odd or 2 if `i` is even, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is either an even number greater than or equal to 2 or 2**
