The first line appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to `answer`. Since `a[0]` is 1 and `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `array[a[0]]` is 2. Therefore, `answer` becomes a list containing the integers 1 and 2. The second line increments `a[0]` by 1, making `a[0]` equal to 2. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and 2, a is a list containing the integers 2 and -1, _ is 0, stdin is empty, i is an even number**
