Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and the integer at index 1 in array, a is a list containing the integers 2 and -1, stdin is empty, i is an even number**

Explanation:

The first line of code appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to the `answer` list. Since `a[0]` is initially 1, the value at index 1 in the `array` list is appended to `answer`. The second line increments the value of `a[0]` by 1, making it 2. No other variables are affected by the code.

Note that the value of `array[a[0]]` is not specified in the initial state, so it is represented as "the integer at index 1 in array" in the output state.
