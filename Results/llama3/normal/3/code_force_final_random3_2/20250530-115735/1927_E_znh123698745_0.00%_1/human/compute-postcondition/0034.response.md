Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than `i`, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[a[-1]]` if `i` is odd or `array[1]` if `i` is even, and either `array[a[-1]]` if `i` is odd or `array[1]` if `i` is even, and either `array[a[-1]]` if `i` is odd or `array[1]` if `i` is even. `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and either -4 if `i` is odd or 0 if `i` is even, or 2 and either -3 if `i` is odd or 1 if `i` is even. `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is either an odd number greater than or equal to 3 or 3. If `i` is odd, `a[0]` is either 0 or 1 and `answer` contains `array[a[0]]`. If `i` is even, `a[0]` is either 3 or 4 and `answer` contains `array[a[0]]`.**
