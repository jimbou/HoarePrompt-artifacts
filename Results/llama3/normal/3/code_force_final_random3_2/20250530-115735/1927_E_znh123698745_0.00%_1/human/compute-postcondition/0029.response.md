Output State: **n is an integer greater than i, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1, array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and array[a[0]], a is a list containing the integers 1 and either -2 if i is odd or 2 if i is even, a[0] is either 0 if i is odd or 3 if i is even, _ is 1, stdin is empty, and i is either an even number greater than or equal to 2 or 2.**

The code first appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to the `answer` list. Since `a[0]` is either -2 if `i` is odd or 2 if `i` is even, `array[a[0]]` will be either `array[-2]` or `array[2]`. The second line increments `a[0]` by 1, making it either 0 if `i` is odd or 3 if `i` is even. No other variables are affected.
