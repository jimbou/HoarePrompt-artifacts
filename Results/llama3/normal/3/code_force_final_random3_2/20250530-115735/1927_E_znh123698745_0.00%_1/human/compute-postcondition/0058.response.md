Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers from 1 to n in the order of 1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n/2, n/2+1 if n is even or (n+1)/2, (n+1)/2 if n is odd, a is a list containing the integers n/2+1 and -n/2 if n is even or (n+1)/2 and -(n+1)/2 if n is odd, _ is the number of test cases, stdin is empty, and i is equal to n, and the answer list containing the integers from 1 to n in the order of 1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n/2, n/2+1 if n is even or (n+1)/2, (n+1)/2 if n is odd is being printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 1 time, with the only difference being that the loop has executed for the number of test cases specified in the input, and the answer list is being printed for each test case.
