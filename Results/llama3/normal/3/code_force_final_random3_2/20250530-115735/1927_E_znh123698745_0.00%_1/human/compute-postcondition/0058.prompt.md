Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). Each test case consists of two space-separated integers: n and k, where 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(range(1, n + 1))
    answer = [1]
    a = [1, -1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (-1) ** i == -1:
            answer.append(array[a[-1]])
            a[-1] -= 1
        else:
            answer.append(array[a[0]])
            a[0] += 1
    print(*answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers from 1 to n in the order of 1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n/2, n/2+1 if n is even or (n+1)/2, (n+1)/2 if n is odd, a is a list containing the integers n/2+1 and -n/2 if n is even or (n+1)/2 and -(n+1)/2 if n is odd, _ is 0, stdin is empty, and i is equal to n, and the answer list containing the integers from 1 to n in the order of 1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ..., n/2, n/2+1 if n is even or (n+1)/2, (n+1)/2 if n is odd is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1, array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even. a is a list containing the integers 1 and either -n if i is odd or 1 if i is even, or 2 and either -n+1 if i is odd or 0 if i is even. _ is 1, stdin is empty, and i is either an odd number greater than or equal to n-1 or n-1. If i is odd, a[0] is either 0 or 1 and answer contains array[a[0]]. If i is even, a[0] is either n-1 or n and answer contains array[a[0]]. The list answer is being printed, where answer contains the integers 1, array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even, and either array[a[-1]] if i is odd or array[1] if i is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and all the elements of array in reverse order, a is a list containing the integers n and -n, stdin is empty, and i is equal to n, and the list answer which is [1, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 2] is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
