Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, array is a list of integers from 1 to n, answer is a list containing the integers 1 and all the elements of array in reverse order, a is a list containing the integers n and -n, stdin is empty, and i is equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0.
*   The value of `k` remains unchanged as an integer.
*   The `array` remains unchanged as a list of integers from 1 to `n`.
*   The `answer` list now contains the integer 1 followed by all the elements of `array` in reverse order.
*   The `a` list now contains the integers `n` and `-n`.
*   The `stdin` remains empty.
*   The value of `i` is now equal to `n`.
