To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer greater than 0
* `k` is an integer
* `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`
* `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in the order of 1, `n`, 2, `n-1`, 3, `n-2`, ..., `n/2`, `n/2+1` if `n` is even or `(n+1)/2`, `(n+1)/2` if `n` is odd
* `a` is a list containing the integers `n/2+1` and `-n/2` if `n` is even or `(n+1)/2` and `-(n+1)/2` if `n` is odd
* `_` is 0
* `stdin` is empty
* `i` is equal to `n`
* The `answer` list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in the order of 1, `n`, 2, `n-1`, 3, `n-2`, ..., `n/2`, `n/2+1` if `n` is even or `(n+1)/2`, `(n+1)/2` if `n` is odd is being printed

To execute the loop again, the input value must be greater than 0, and the `_` variable must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in the order of 1, `n`, 2, `n-1`, 3, `n-2`, ..., `n/2`, `n/2+1` if `n` is even or `(n+1)/2`, `(n+1)/2` if `n` is odd, `a` is a list containing the integers `n/2+1` and `-n/2` if `n` is even or `(n+1)/2` and `-(n+1)/2` if `n` is odd, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is equal to `n`**
