To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 0**
