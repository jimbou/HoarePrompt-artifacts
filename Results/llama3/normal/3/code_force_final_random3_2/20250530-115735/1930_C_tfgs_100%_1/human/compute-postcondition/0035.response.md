Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end, `i` is at least 2, `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and `j` is `adv - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `adv` has been updated to be the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `adv` is now a specific value that is the minimum of these three expressions.
