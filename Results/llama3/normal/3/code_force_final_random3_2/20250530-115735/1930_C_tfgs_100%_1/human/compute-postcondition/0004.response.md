Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `a[1]` is increased by 2 because `i` is 1 and `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, and `a` is still a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9.
