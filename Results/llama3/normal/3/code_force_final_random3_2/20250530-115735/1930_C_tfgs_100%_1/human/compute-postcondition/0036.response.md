To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and `adv`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `adv`. If `adv` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, we need to ensure that at least one of these values is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end, `i` is at least 2, `adv` must be greater than 0, and `j` is 0**
