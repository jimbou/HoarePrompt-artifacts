Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus 1 minus `adv`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended at the end and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended at the end, `i` is at least 2, `adv` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `j` is `adv - 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then the above conditions are met. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
