Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `cnt` remains the same, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended at the end and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended at the end and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended at the end, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is at least 1 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and `j` is 2 and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` is appended at the end of `ans`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `a[i - 1] - j - 1` is appended at the end of the list `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
