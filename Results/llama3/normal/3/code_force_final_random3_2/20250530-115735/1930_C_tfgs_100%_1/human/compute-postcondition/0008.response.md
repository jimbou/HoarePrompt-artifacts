Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, cur is 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is the count of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is an empty list, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.**

Here's a description of the final state:

The code initializes a Counter object `counter` with the list `a`, which counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. The variable `cur` is set to 0. The list `a` is then converted to a set, which removes duplicates, and then sorted in descending order. The variable `cnt` is calculated as the difference between the original length of `a` (`n`) and the length of the new sorted list `a`, which represents the count of duplicate integers in the original list. An empty list `ans` is initialized. The value of `i` remains unchanged at `n-1`. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus 2 lines.
