#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It modifies the integers by adding their 1-based index to each, removes duplicates, and sorts them in descending order. Then, it constructs a new list by inserting missing integers between the sorted unique integers, ensuring that the count of each integer is preserved. Finally, it prints the constructed list, which contains the original integers with their counts preserved and missing integers filled in between.
