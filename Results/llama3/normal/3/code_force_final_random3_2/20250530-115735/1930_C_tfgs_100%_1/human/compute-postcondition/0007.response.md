Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `a[0]` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 + 1, `a[1]` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 + 2, ..., `a[n-1]` is an integer between `n` and 10^9 + `n`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the input remains unchanged, the size of the list `a` remains the same, but each element in the list `a` has been incremented by its index plus one. The loop counter `i` has reached the last index of the list `a`.
