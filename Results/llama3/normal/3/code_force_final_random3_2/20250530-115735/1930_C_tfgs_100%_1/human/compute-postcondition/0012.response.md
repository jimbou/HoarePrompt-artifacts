To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `adv`. The loop will execute if `adv` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0**
