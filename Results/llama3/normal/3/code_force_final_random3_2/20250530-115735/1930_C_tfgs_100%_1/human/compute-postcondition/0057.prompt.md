You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `a[0]` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 + 1, `a[1]` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 + 2, ..., `a[n-1]` is an integer between `n` and 10^9 + `n`, `i` is `n-1`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)

        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1 for all i, cur is the sum of its original value and the count of a[i] in the original list a minus the sum of adv for all i, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times and a[i] appended at the end for all i, i is -1, adv is at least 0 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur for all i, and j is adv - 1 for all i.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus the sum of `adv` for all `i`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end for all `i`, and `ans` has `cnt` additional elements which are 1 less than the last element of `ans`, `i` is -1, `adv` is at least 0 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` for all `i`, and `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: a list of integers containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end for all `i`, and `cnt` additional elements which are 1 less than the last element of `ans`

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
