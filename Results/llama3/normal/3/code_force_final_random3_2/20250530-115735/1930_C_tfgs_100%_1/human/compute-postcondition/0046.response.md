Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1 for all i, cur is the sum of its original value and the count of a[i] in the original list a minus the sum of adv for all i, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times and a[i] appended at the end for all i, i is -1, adv is at least 0 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur for all i, and j is adv - 1 for all i.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the counter dictionary has been updated to reflect the decreased count of each unique integer in the list a, the cur variable has been updated to reflect the sum of its original value and the count of each unique integer in the list a minus the sum of adv for all i, the cnt variable is 0, the ans list contains the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times and a[i] appended at the end for all i, and the i variable is -1. The adv variable is at least 0 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur for all i, and the j variable is adv - 1 for all i.
