Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains between 1 and 3 * 10^5. The dictionary `counter` still contains the unique integers from `a` as keys and their respective counts as values. The variable `cur` remains 0. The list `a` is still sorted in descending order and contains at least one integer. The count of duplicate integers in the original list `a` is still stored in `cnt`. The list `ans` now contains two values: the original value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and the newly appended value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The values of `i`, `adv`, and `j` remain greater than 0, 0, and 1, respectively.
