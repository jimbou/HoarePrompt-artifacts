To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, and `a` is a sorted list of unique integers.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Since `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the new value of `i` will be at least 2.

The state of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end, `i` is at least 2, `adv` is at least 1 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and `j` is `adv - 1**
