The value of `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, where `i` is 2. So, `a[2]` is increased by 3. The value of `a[2]` was between 1 and 10^9, so the new value of `a[2]` is between 4 and 10^9 + 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `a[0]` is an integer between 2 and 10^9 + 1, `a[1]` is an integer between 3 and 10^9 + 2, `a[2]` is an integer between 4 and 10^9 + 3, `a[3]` to `a[n-1]` are integers between 1 and 10^9, `i` is 2**
