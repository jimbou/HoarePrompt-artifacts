Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended at the end, `i` is at least 2, `adv` must be greater than 0, and `j` is 0**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been updated by appending the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to its end. The other variables remain unchanged.
