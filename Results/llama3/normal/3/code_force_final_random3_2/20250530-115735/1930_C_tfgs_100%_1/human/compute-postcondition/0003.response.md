The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `i` is 1**
