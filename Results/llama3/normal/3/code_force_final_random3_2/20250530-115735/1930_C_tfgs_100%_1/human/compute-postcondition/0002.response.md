The value of `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, where `i` is 0. So, `a[i]` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `i` is 0.
