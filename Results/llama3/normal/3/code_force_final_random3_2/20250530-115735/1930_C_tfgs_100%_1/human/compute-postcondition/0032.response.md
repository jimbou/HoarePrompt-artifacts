Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, where the count of a[i] is decreased by adv if i > 0, otherwise the count of a[i] remains the same, cur is the sum of its original value and the count of a[i] in the original list a minus adv if i > 0, otherwise cur remains the same, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is the count of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv if i is greater than 0, otherwise cnt remains the same, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times and a[i] appended at the end if i > 0, otherwise ans remains the same, i is greater than or equal to 1, adv is at least 1 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur if i > 0, otherwise adv remains the same, and j is adv - 1 if i > 0, otherwise j remains the same.***
