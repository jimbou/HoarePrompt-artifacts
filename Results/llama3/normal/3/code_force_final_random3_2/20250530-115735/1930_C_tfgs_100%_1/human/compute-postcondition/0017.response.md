Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `i` is greater than 0, `adv` is greater than 1, and `j` is 2**

The code appends a new value to the list `ans`, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Since `j` is 2, the new value is `a[i - 1] - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
