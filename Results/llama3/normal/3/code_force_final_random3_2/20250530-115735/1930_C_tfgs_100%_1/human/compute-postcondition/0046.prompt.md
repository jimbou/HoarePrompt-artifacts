Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, cur is 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is the count of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is an empty list, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        cur -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1
    cur += counter[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1, cur is the sum of its original value and the count of a[i] in the original list a, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is the count of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv if i is greater than 0, otherwise cnt remains the same, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times and a[i] appended at the end, i is greater than or equal to 0, adv is greater than or equal to 0 if i is greater than 0, and j is adv - 1 if i is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1, cur is the sum of its original value and the count of a[i] in the original list a minus 1, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is the count of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times and a[i] appended at the end, i is greater than or equal to 1, adv is at least 1 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur, and j is adv - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, cur is the sum of its original value and the count of a[i] in the original list a minus 1 minus adv, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is the count of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times and a[i] and a[i - 1] - j - 1 and a[i - 1] - j - 1 and a[i - 1] - j - 1 appended at the end and a[i - 1] - j - 1 appended at the end, i is at least 2, adv is greater than or equal to 0, and j is adv - 1. If i is greater than 0, then the above conditions are met. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
