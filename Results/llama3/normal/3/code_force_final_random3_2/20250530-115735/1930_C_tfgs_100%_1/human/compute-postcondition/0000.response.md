Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9.**

In this output state, the code has consumed two lines from stdin for each test case, leaving the remaining test cases in stdin. The variable `n` now holds the value of the first integer from the first line of each test case, which is between 1 and 3 * 10^5. The variable `a` is a list containing `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9, from the second line of each test case.
