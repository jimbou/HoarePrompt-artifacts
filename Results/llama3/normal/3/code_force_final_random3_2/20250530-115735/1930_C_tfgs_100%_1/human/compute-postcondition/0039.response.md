Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus 1, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended at the end, `i` is at least 2, `adv` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ans` has an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1` appended to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
