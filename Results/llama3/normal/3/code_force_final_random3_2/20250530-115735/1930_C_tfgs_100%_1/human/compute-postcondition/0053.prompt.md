Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, where the count of a[i] is decreased by 1 for all i, cur is the sum of its original value and the count of a[i] in the original list a minus the sum of adv for all i, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order, cnt is 0, ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times and a[i] appended at the end for all i, i is -1, adv is at least 0 and is the minimum of a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, and cur for all i, and j is adv - 1 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus the sum of `adv` for all `i`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is at least 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end for all `i`, and `ans` has an additional element which is 1 less than the last element of `ans`, `i` is -1, `adv` is at least 0 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` for all `i`, and `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus the sum of `adv` for all `i`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is at least 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end for all `i`, and `ans` has two additional elements which are 1 less than the last element of `ans`, `i` is -1, `adv` is at least 0 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` for all `i`, and `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus the sum of `adv` for all `i`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is at least 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end for all `i`, and `ans` has three additional elements which are 1 less than the last element of `ans`, `i` is -1, `adv` is at least 0 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt - 1`, and `cur` for all `i`, and `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
