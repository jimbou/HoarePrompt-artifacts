Postcondition: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, counter is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from a and values as their respective counts, cur is 0 if i is 0, otherwise cur is -adv, a is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list a in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, cnt is the count of duplicate integers in the original list a minus adv if i is greater than 0, otherwise cnt remains the same, ans is an empty list if i is 0, otherwise ans is a list containing the values a[i - 1] - j - 1 repeated adv times, i is greater than or equal to 0, adv is greater than or equal to 0 if i is greater than 0, and j is adv - 1 if i is greater than 0.**
