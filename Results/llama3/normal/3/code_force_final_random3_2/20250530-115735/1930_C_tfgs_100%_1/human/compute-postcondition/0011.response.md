Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, `cur` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order that must have at least 1 integer, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is greater than 0, and `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `adv` is calculated as the minimum of the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list `a` minus 1, the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a`, and the current value of `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.
