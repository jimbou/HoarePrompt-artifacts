Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by `adv`, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a` minus `adv` if `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `cnt` remains the same, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `adv` is at least 1 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`, and `j` is `adv - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated `adv` times, where `adv` is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. In each iteration, the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` is appended to the list `ans`, where `j` ranges from 0 to `adv - 1`. After the loop finishes, the list `ans` contains `adv` values of the form `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, followed by the value `a[i]`. The other variables, `n`, `counter`, `cur`, `a`, `cnt`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
