Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `counter` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `a` and values as their respective counts, where the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1 for all `i`, `cur` is the sum of its original value and the count of `a[i]` in the original list `a` minus the sum of `adv` for all `i`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list `a` in descending order, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` repeated `adv` times and `a[i]` appended at the end for all `i`, and `ans` has `cnt` additional elements which are 1 less than the last element of `ans`, `i` is -1, `adv` is at least 0 and is the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur` for all `i`, and `j` is `adv - 1` for all `i`, and the elements of the list `ans` are printed**
