Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is at least len(a) + 1, ii is len(a), n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, tmp is an empty list, ans is x + y - 2, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. If the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is not 2, then if the difference is even, `tmp` is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list that contains at least one element which is the integer division of the difference between the third and second elements of `a` by 2. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is odd, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list with a new element appended, which is half of this difference. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is odd, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
