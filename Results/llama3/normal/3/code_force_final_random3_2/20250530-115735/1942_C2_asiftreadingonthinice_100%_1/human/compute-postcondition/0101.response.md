Postcondition: **`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. The difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is not equal to 2. The current value of `i` is 1, and the difference between the element of `a` at index `i` and the element of `a` at index `i - 1` is even.**
