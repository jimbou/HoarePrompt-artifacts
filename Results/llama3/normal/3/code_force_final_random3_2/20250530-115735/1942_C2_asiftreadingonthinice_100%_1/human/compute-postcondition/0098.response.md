Postcondition: **`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. The current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is 2, indicating that the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list `a` is 2.**
