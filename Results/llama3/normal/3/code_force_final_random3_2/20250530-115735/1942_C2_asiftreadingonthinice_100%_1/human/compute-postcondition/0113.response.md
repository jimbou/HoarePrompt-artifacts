Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements. If the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list with an additional element which is the integer division of the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` by 2. If the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1.***
