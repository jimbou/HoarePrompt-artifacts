The code snippet increments `ans` by the value of `i`, which is the third element in the list `tmp`. Since `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is a specific integer value. The value of `ans` is increased by this specific value.

The second line decrements `y` by the value of `i - 1`. Since `i` is an integer, `i - 1` is also an integer. The value of `y` is decreased by this specific integer value.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **tt is at least 1, ii is len(a) - 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, tmp is a non-empty sorted list containing at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list tmp, ans is increased by the value of i, y is decreased by the value of i - 1**
