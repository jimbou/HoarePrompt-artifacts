Output State: **`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, `i` is the last element in the list `tmp`, `ans` is increased by the value of `y`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `y`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The program continues to execute without breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
