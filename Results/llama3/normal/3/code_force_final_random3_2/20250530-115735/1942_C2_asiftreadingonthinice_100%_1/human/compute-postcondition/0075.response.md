Postcondition: **tt is at least len(a) + 1, ii is len(a), n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, tmp is a list of integers. If the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is 2, then ans is x + y - 1 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in a is 2, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is printed. If the difference between the first and last elements of a plus n is not 2, then if the difference is even, tmp is a list of integers including the value (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2, ans is x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in a is 2, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is printed.**
