Output State: **`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the last element in the list `tmp`, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` + 1 plus `y`, and `y` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` + 1 minus the number of elements in `tmp` that are less than or equal to `y` + 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: all variables keep their initial values except for `ans` which is increased by `y`.
