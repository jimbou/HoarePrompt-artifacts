Output State: **`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
