Postcondition: **`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, if the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is even, then `tmp` is a list of integers including the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2, the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. In all cases, the difference between the first and last elements of `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2.**
