The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  tmp, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tmp.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, tmp has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list, so for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`.**
