Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list with a new element appended, which is half of this difference. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
