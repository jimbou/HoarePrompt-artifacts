Output State: **`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `tmp` is a list with an additional element which is the integer division of the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` by 2, if the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is even, otherwise `tmp` is a list with an additional element which is the integer division of the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` by 2, and `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `tmp` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the integer division of the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` by 2, but only if the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is even. The value of `ans` has been updated to be increased by 1 if the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
