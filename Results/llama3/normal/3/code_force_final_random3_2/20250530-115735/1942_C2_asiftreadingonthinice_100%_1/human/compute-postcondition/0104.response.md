Postcondition: **`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, and `i` is 1, and `ans` is `x + y - 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list and `ans` is `x + y - 2`.**
