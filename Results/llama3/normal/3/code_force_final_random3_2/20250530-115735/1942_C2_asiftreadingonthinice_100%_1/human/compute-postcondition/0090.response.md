Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is decremented by `i - 1`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
