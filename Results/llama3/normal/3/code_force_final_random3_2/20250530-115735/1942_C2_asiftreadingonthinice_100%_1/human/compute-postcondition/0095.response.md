To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and `tt`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `ii` is less than `tt`. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is `len(a)` and `tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be increased by 1.

State: **`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a list of integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `tmp`, `ans` is increased by the value of `y`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is being printed**
