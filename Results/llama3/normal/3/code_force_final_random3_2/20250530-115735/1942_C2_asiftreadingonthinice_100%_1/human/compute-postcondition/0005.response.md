Output State: **tt is at least 1, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is x + y - 1, tmp is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 1. The current value of i is 1. The difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: tt is still at least 1, ii is still 0, n is still an integer, x is still an integer, y is still an integer, a is still a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, ans has been incremented by 1 and is now x + y - 1, tmp is still an empty list, stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers, i is still 1, and the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is still 2.
