Postcondition: **`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` is 2, then `ans` is increased by the number of such pairs. Additionally, the difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` is not equal to `n - 2`. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` contains the integer division of the difference between the elements by 2 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is even but not 2, and also contains the integer division of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` by 2. Otherwise, `tmp` contains the integer division of the difference between the elements by 2 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is even but not 2.**
