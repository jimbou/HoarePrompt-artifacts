Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code `tt = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `tt`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `tt` will be equal to `t`. The remaining input, which consists of `t-1` test cases, is still present in the standard input. Each test case consists of two lines, where the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x), and the second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
