The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list tmp, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tmp.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, tmp has at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list tmp. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the i is the second integer in the list.
State: **`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `tmp`.**
