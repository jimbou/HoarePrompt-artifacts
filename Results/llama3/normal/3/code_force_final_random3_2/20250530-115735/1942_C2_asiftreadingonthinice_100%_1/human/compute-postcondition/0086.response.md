Postcondition: **`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
