Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by the value of `i` minus 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
