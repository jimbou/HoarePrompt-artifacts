Postcondition: **tt is at least 1, ii is len(a) - 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] equals 2, then ans is x + y - 1 plus the number of times the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a is 2, and tmp is a list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a whenever the difference is even but not 2. Otherwise, ans is x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a is 2, and tmp is a list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a whenever the difference is even but not 2. If the difference between the first and last elements of the list a plus n is even, tmp also contains the integer value of half of the difference between the first and last elements of the list a plus n.**
