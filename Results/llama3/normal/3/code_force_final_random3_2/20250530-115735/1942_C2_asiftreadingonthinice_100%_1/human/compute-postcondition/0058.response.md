To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`
* `ii` is `len(a)`
* `n` is an integer
* `x` is an integer
* `y` is an integer
* `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements
* `i` is 1

We can see that the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(a)`. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to increment it by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the new state of `i` should be 2.

The other objects in the loop head are `a`, which is a sorted list of integers. Since `a` has at least 2 elements, we can conclude that `a` has at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
