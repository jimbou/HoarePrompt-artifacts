The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and list `tmp`. If `i` is less than `len(tmp)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the second element in the list `tmp`. 
State: **`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`.**
