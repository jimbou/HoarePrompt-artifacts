Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is not equal to 2. If the difference between the current element of `a` at index `i` and the previous element of `a` at index `i - 1` is even, `tmp` is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty list.***
