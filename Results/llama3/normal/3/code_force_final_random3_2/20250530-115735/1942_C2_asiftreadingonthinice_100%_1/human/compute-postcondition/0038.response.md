Output State: **`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
