Postcondition: **tt is at least 1, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the element at index 1 and the element at index 0 in list a is 2, then ans is x + y - 1. Otherwise, if the difference is even, tmp is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the second element and the first element in list a, and ans is x + y - 2. If the difference is odd, tmp remains an empty list and ans is x + y - 2.**
