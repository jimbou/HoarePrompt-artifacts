Output State: **tt is at least 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, tmp is a list that contains the integer value of (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the value of tmp has been updated to include the integer value of (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since it contained only one input which has been used.
