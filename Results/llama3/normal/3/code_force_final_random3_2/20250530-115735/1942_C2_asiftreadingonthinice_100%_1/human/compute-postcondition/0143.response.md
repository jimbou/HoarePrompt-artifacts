Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of operations required to make a sequence of integers consecutive. It takes no arguments and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, x, and y, and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function sorts the list of integers, calculates the number of operations required to make the sequence consecutive, and prints the minimum of this number and n-2. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
