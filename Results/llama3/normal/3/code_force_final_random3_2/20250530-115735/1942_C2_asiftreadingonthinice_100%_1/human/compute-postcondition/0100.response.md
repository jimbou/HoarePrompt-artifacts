Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least len(a) + 1, `ii` is len(a) + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `ans` is x + y - 2, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. The difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is not equal to 2.***
