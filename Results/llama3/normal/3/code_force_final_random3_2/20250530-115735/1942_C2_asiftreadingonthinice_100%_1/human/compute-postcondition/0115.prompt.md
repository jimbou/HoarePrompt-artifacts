Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is at least len(a) + 1, ii is len(a) + 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, tmp is an empty list, i is undefined, ans is x + y - 2, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list `a` is 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1`. Otherwise, if the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`, and `i` is 1, and `ans` is `x + y - 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list and `ans` is `x + y - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list with an additional element which is the integer division of the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements. If the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list with an additional element which is the integer division of the difference between the last and second last elements of `a` by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
