The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `tmp`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tmp`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element in the list.
State: **`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`.**
