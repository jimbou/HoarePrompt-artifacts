Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is `x + y - 1` plus the number of times the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` is 2, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` is 2, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2. If the difference between the first and last elements of the list `a` plus `n` is even, `tmp` also contains the integer value of half of the difference between the first and last elements of the list `a` plus `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the first element in the list `tmp`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - i + 1` and `ans` is updated to its original value plus `i`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by the value of `i - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
