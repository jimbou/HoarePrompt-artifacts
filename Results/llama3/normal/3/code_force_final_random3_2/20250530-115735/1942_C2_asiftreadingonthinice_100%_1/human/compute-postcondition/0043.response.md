Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by the value of `i - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
