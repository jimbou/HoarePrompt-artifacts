Output State: **tt is at least 1, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is x + y - 2, tmp is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the second element and the first element in list a, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 1, the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is not equal to 2, and the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is even.**

In this output state, the value of tmp has been updated to include the integer which is half of the difference between the second element and the first element in list a. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers. The difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is still not equal to 2 and is still even.
