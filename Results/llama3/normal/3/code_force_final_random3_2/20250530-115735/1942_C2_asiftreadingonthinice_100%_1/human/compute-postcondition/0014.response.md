Postcondition: **tt is at least 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements. If the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a is even, tmp is a list that contains the integer value of half of this difference, and stdin contains no input. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
