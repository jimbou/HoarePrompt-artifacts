Output State: **tt is at least 1, ii is len(a) - 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, ans is x + y - 1 plus the number of times the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a is 2, tmp is a list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a whenever the difference is even but not 2. The current value of a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] equals 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted, and the relationship between `a[0]`, `n`, and `a[len(a) - 1]` remains the same. The input in `stdin` is still waiting to be processed.
