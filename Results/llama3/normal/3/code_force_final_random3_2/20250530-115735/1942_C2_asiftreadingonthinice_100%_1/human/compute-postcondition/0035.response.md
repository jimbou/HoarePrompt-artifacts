Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, `i` is the first element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the first element in the list `tmp`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
