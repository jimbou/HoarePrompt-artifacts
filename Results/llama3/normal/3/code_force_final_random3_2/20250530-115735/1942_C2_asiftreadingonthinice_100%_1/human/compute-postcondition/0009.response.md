Postcondition: ***tt is at least 1, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is x + y - 2, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, i is 1, and the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is not equal to 2. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in list a is even, tmp is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the second element and the first element in list a. Otherwise, tmp remains an empty list.***
