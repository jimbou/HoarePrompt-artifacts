Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - i + 1` and `ans` is updated to its original value plus `i`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
