The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `tmp`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tmp`. If `tmp` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `tmp` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list.
State: **`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`.**
