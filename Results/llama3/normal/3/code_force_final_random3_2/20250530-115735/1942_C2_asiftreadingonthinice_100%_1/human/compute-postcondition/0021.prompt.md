Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tt is at least 1, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, ans is x + y - 2, tmp is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: tt is at least 1, ii is 0, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between the element at index 1 and the element at index 0 in list a is 2, then ans is x + y - 1. Otherwise, if the difference is even, tmp is a list containing one integer which is half of the difference between the second element and the first element in list a, and ans is x + y - 2. If the difference is odd, tmp remains an empty list and ans is x + y - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *tt is at least 1, ii is 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements. If the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a is 2, ans is increased by 1 and stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers. If the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a is even but not 2, tmp is a list that contains the integer value of half of this difference, and stdin contains no input. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains either 1 input: a space-separated list of integers or no input. If the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the difference between the second and first elements of `a` is even, `tmp` is a list that contains the value of (a[2] - a[1]) // 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
