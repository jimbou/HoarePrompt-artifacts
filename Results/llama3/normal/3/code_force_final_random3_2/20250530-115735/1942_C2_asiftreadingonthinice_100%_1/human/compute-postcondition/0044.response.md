Output State: **`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, `i` is the last element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by the value of `i - 1`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `tmp` still contains the integer values of half of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not 2. The variable `i` now points to the last element in `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` has been increased by the value of `i` and `y` has been decreased by `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the loop has exited without updating `ans` or `y`.
