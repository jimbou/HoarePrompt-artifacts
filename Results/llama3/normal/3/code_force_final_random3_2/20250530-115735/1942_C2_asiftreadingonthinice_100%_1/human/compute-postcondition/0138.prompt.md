Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `len(a)` - 1, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers containing the integer division of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` by 2 for each pair with even difference not equal to 2, and the integer division of (`a[0]` + `n` - `a[len(a) - 1]`) by 2 if (`a[0]` + `n` - `a[len(a) - 1]`) % 2 == 0, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n` - 2 is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i` - 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by `i` - 1. Otherwise, the minimum value between `ans` and `n` - 2 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by the value of `i` minus 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `tmp` is a sorted list of integers with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by the value of `i - 1`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
