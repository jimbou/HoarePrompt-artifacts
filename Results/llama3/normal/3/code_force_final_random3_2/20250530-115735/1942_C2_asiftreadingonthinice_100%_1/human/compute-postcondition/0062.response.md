Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is even but not 2, `tmp` is a list that contains at least one element which is the integer division of the difference between the third and second elements of `a` by 2. If the difference between the third and second elements of `a` is odd, no additional changes are made.***
