Postcondition: **`tt` is at least `len(a) + 1`, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `tmp` is an empty list, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, and the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` is printed, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is 1 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is 2.**
