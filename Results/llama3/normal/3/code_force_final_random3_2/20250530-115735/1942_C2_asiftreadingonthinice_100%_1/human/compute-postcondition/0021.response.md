Output State: **tt is at least 1, ii is len(a) - 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, y is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, ans is x + y - 2 plus the number of times the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a is 2, tmp is a list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list a whenever the difference is even but not 2.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following properties:

- `tt` is still at least 1.
- `ii` will be equal to the second last index of the list `a`.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as integers.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
- `stdin` still contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers.
- `ans` will be increased by 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, starting from the initial value of `x + y - 2`.
- `tmp` will contain the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2.
