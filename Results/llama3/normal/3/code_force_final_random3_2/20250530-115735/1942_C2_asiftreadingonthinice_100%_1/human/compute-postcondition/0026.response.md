Output State: **`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` is 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value of half of the difference between two consecutive elements in the list `a` whenever the difference is even but not 2, and also contains the integer value of half of the difference between the first and last elements of the list `a` plus `n`, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of integers, and the difference between the first and last elements of the list `a` plus `n` is not equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the integer value of half of the difference between the first and last elements of the list `a` plus `n` to the list `tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
