Postcondition: ***`tt` is at least `len(a)` + 1, `ii` is `len(a)`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `tmp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `i` and `y` is decreased by the value of `i - 1`. Otherwise, if `y` is less than `i - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
