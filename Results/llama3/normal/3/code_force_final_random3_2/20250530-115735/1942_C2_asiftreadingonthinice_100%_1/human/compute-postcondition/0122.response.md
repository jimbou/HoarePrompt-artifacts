Postcondition: **tt is at least len(a) + 1, ii is len(a) + 1, n is an integer, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, i is len(a) - 1, and the minimum value between ans and n - 2 is printed. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list a is 2, then ans is increased by the number of such pairs. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list a is even but not 2, then tmp contains the integer division of the difference between the elements by 2 for each such pair. If the difference between the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is 2, then ans is increased by 1. If the difference between the first element of a and n minus the last element of a is not 2, then the difference between the first element of a and the last element of a is not equal to n - 2, and if (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0, then tmp also contains the integer division of (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) by 2.**
