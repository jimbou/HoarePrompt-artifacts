To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and `tt`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can adjust the state to `tt` is at least 1 and `ii` is 0 (since the loop starts from 0).

State: **`tt` is at least 1, `ii` is 0**
