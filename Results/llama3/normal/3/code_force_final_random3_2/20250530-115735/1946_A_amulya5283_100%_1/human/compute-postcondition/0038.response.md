The code prints the value of `res`, which is equal to the number of times `a[mdx]` appears in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1`. Since `mdx` is less than or equal to `n`, and `i` is equal to `n`, the range of indices considered is from `mdx` to `n-1`, which is a subset of the list `a`.

Output: **the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1**
