The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers. The first input `n` is assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs are still in the stdin. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
