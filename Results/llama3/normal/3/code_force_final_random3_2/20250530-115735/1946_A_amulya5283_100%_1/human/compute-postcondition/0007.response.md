The first line assigns the value of 0 to `res`. The second line calculates the value of `mdx` by performing integer division of `n` by 2, adding the remainder of `n` divided by 2, and then subtracting 1. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `mdx` will be an integer between 0 and `n-1` inclusive. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, res is 0, mdx is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive.**
