Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, res is 0, mdx is an integer equal to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1, stdin contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `res` is initialized to 0, and `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, which is an integer value. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing 0 inputs.
