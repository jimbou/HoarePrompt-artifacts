Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains 0 inputs. If n is 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, res is equal to the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1, mdx is an integer equal to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1, and the value of res is being printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable n will still be an integer greater than or equal to 1, and the list a will still be a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The stdin will contain 0 inputs, indicating that all input has been consumed. If n is 1, the number 1 will be printed, otherwise, the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1 will be printed, where mdx is an integer equal to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1.
