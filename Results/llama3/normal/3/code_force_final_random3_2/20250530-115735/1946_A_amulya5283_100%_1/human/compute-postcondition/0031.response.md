To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(mdx, n):`

The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx`, and `mdx` is less than `n`.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, since it is the loop variable. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `mdx + 1`.

The state of `mdx` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `n` also remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `t`, `a`, and `res`, are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`**
