The code increments the value of `res` by 1. The initial value of `res` is 0, so after the increment, `res` becomes 1.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. The value of `t` is still an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is still a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is still less than `n`, and `i` is still equal to `mdx`. The current value of `a[mdx]` is still equal to the current value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `res` is 1, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**
