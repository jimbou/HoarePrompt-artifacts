To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, which means it's the middle index of the list `a` (or the index just after the middle if `n` is even). For the loop to execute, `mdx` must be less than `n`.
2. `i` is the loop variable, which starts from `mdx`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be initialized to `mdx`.
3. `n` is the upper bound of the loop. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `mdx`.


Considering the initial state, we can adjust the states as follows:


* `mdx` must be less than `n`.
* `i` is initialized to `mdx`.
* `n` is greater than `mdx`.


The other variables (`t`, `a`, `res`, and `stdin`) are not directly related to the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.


State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `res` is 0, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, stdin contains 0 inputs**
