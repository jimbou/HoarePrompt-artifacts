To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `t > 0`.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, we can see that `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time.

The state of `stdin` containing multiple test cases does not affect the execution of the `while` loop, as the loop condition only depends on the value of `t`.

So, the program state right before the loop can remain the same, as `t` is already within a range that ensures the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
