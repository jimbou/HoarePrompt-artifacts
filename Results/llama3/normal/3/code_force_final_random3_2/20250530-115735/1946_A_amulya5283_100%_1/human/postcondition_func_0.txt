This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It sorts the list of integers and then prints the number of times the middle element (or the element just after the middle if n is even) appears in the sorted list from the middle index to the end. If the list contains only one element, it prints 1. The function continues to process test cases until all input has been read.
