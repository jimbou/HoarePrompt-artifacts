The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mdx and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `mdx` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx` and `mdx` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is equal to `mdx + 1` and `mdx` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, no change in `res`**
