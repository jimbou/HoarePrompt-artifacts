Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is less than or equal to n, i is equal to n, res is equal to the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1, and the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1 which is res is printed.***
