Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first sorts the array in non-decreasing order, which is necessary to find the median.

2. It then checks if the length of the array is 1. If it is, the program prints 1, which is correct because increasing the only element in the array will increase the median.

3. If the length of the array is more than 1, the program calculates the index of the median (mdx) and then counts the number of elements that are equal to the median and are to the right of the median (including the median itself). This is because increasing any of these elements will increase the median.

4. The program then prints the count of these elements, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including arrays with distinct elements, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with a length of 1. It also correctly handles the case where the median is the smallest element in the array, in which case increasing the median will require increasing all elements to the right of the median.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
