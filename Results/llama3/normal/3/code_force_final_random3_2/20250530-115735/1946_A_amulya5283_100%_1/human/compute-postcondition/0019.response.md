The code prints the value of `res`, which is equal to the number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. Since `mdx` is equal to `n`, this means that `res` is the number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to the element at index `n` in the list `a`. However, since `i` is also equal to `n`, it means that the element at index `n` is the last element in the list `a`. Therefore, `res` is the number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to the last element in the list `a`.

Output: **the number of elements in the list a that are equal to the last element in the list a**
