To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `mdx` is less than `n`. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 1, we need to adjust `mdx` to be less than `n`. 

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `res` is 0, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`**
