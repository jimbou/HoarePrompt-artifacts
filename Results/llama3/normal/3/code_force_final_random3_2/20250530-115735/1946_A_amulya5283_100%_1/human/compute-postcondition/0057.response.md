The code prints the value of `res`, which is the number of times `a[mdx]` appears in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1`.

Since `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, it is the index of the middle element of the list `a` (or the index of the first element of the second half of the list if `n` is even).

The value of `a[mdx]` is the middle element of the sorted list `a` (or the first element of the second half of the list if `n` is even).

The value of `res` is the number of times this middle element appears in the second half of the list `a`.

Output: **the number of times the middle element of the sorted list a appears in the second half of the list a**
