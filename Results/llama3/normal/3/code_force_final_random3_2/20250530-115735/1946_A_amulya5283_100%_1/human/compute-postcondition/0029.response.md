Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `res` is 1, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, and the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

The code increments the value of `res` by 1. The initial value of `res` was 0, so after the increment, `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
