Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, res is 0, mdx is the integer part of n/2 plus the remainder of n divided by 2 minus 1.**

The code initializes two new variables, `res` and `mdx`, without modifying the existing variables `t`, `n`, and `a`. The value of `res` is set to 0, and the value of `mdx` is calculated based on the value of `n`. The calculation `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` effectively rounds `n` down to the nearest even number and then subtracts 1. This means that `mdx` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `n/2`.
