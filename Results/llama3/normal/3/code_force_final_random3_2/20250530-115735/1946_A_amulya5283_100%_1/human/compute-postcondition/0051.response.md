Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx + 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`, `res` is either 2 or 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` was either 1 or no change in `res` depending on whether `a[mdx]` was equal to `a[i]`. Since `res` is incremented by 1, the new value of `res` is either 2 or 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
