Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, mdx is less than or equal to n, i is equal to n, res is equal to the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `mdx` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `res` is equal to the number of times `a[mdx]` appears in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1`.
