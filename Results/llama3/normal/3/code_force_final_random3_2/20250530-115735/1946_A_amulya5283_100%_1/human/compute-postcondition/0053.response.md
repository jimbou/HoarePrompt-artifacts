To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(mdx, n):`. The objects involved are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `mdx + 1`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes `mdx + 2`. The value of `mdx` remains the same, and `n` must still be greater than `mdx + 2`.

The other variables `t`, `a`, and `res` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` is 2.**
