Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `res` is 1, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`, stdin contains 0 inputs. The current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `res` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still sorted, and the relationship between `mdx`, `i`, and the values of `a[mdx]` and `a[i]` remains the same. The input state is still empty, with 0 inputs in stdin.
