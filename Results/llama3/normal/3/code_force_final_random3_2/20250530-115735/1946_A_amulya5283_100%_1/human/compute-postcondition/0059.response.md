Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains 0 inputs. If n is 1, 1 is printed. Otherwise, res is equal to the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1, mdx is an integer equal to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1, and the value of res is being printed.***
