Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 3. Otherwise, `res` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is now 3. Otherwise, `res` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
