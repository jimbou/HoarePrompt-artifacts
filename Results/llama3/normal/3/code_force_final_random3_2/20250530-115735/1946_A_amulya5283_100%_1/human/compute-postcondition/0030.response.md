Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res`***
