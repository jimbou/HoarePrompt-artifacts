Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, res is equal to the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1, mdx is an integer equal to n // 2 + n % 2 - 1, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `res` will be equal to the number of times the value at index `mdx` in list `a` appears in the sublist of `a` from index `mdx` to the end of the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
