The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mdx, and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `mdx` and `n`. If mdx is less than n, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, res is 0, mdx is an integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `mdx` is less than `n` and `i` is now `mdx`.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, res is 0, mdx is less than n, i is mdx**
