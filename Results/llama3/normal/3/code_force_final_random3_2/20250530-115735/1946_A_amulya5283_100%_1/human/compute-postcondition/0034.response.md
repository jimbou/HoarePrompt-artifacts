The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, mdx and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `mdx` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`, `mdx` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be equal to `mdx + 2` and `mdx` is less than `n - 1` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2`. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**
