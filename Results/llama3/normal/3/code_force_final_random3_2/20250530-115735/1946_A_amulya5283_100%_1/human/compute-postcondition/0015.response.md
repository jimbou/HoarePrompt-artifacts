To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for i in range(mdx, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is `mdx + 2`.**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `i`, as it is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be updated for the loop to execute again. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `mdx`) remain unchanged.
