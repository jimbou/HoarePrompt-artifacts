Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 2`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 3. Otherwise, `res` is 2.***
