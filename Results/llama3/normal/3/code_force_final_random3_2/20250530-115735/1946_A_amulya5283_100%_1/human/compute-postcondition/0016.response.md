Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and `res` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, and `i` remain unchanged, while the value of `res` is incremented by 1. The relationship between `i` and `mdx` is still maintained, with `i` being equal to `mdx + 2`.
