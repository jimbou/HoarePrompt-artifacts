Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. It sorts the array in ascending order.

If the length of the array is 1, it prints 1, because increasing the only element in the array will increase the median.

If the length of the array is more than 1, it calculates the index of the median (mdx) and initializes a variable res to 0. It then iterates over the array from the median index to the end, and for each element that is equal to the median, it increments res.

Finally, it prints the value of res, which represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the median of the array and counts the number of elements that need to be increased to increase the median. The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the array.

Correctness: **True**
