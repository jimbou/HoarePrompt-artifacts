According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive. So for the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If n is equal to 1, the number 1 is printed. Otherwise, mdx is less than or equal to n, i is equal to n, res is equal to the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1, and the number of times a[mdx] appears in a from index mdx to n-1 which is res is printed.**
