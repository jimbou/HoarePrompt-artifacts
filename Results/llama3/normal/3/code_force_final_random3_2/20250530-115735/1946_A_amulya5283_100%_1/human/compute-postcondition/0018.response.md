Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, mdx is equal to n, i is equal to n, res is equal to the number of elements in the list a that are equal to a[mdx].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `mdx` is now equal to `n`, `i` is now equal to `n`, and `res` is now equal to the number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. This means that the loop has counted the number of occurrences of the value `a[mdx]` in the list `a`.
