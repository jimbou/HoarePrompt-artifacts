Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `mdx` is less than `n`, `i` is equal to `mdx + 1`, `res` is either 1 or 2. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated. If the current value of `a[mdx]` is equal to the current value of `a[i]`, then `res` is now 2. Otherwise, `res` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
