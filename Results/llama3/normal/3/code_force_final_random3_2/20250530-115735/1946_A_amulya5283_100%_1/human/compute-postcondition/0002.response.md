The code snippet provided consists of four lines. The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1. The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. The third line reads a list of integers from stdin, converts them to a list of integers, and assigns it to `a`. The fourth line sorts the list `a` in ascending order.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, decremented by 1 from its initial value.
* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, read from stdin.
* `a` is a sorted list of integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, read from stdin.

Note that the value of `t` is decremented by 1, and the values of `n` and `a` are assigned new values read from stdin. The sorting of the list `a` does not change the values of the integers, but only their order.

Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^5 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a sorted list of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**
