Output: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is either the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, or the product of the first element of a and the differences between consecutive elements of a if n is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, and ans is printed, where ans is either the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, or the product of the first element of a and the differences between consecutive elements of a if n is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a**
