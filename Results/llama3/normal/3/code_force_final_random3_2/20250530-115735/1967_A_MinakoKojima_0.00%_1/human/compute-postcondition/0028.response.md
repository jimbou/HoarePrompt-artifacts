To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the first input integer, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0**
