You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        m = min(a)
        
        ans = 0
        
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is either the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, or the product of the first element of a and the differences between consecutive elements of a if n is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a, _ is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, stdin contains no inputs, and ans is printed for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is either the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, or the product of the first element of a and the differences between consecutive elements of a if n is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a, _ is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, stdin contains no inputs, and ans is printed for each test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
