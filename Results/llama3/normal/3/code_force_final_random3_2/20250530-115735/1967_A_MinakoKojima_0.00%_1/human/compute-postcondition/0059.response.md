Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list of integers from the input minus the sum of min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is the smallest integer in a, `ans` is the product of the first element of a and the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of the first element of `a` and the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a`. The value of `i` has been incremented to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
