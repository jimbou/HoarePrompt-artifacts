Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `k` has been updated to be the original value of `k` minus the product of the original value of `n` and the smallest integer in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
