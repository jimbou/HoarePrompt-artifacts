#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        m = min(a)
        
        ans = 0
        
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is either the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, or the product of the first element of a and the differences between consecutive elements of a if n is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a, _ is equal to the number of test cases minus 1, stdin contains no inputs, and ans is printed for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it calculates a result (ans) based on the values of n, k, and the input integers. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and the smallest integer in the input list, ans is set to the factorial of n. Otherwise, it adjusts the input integers and calculates ans as the product of the first element and the differences between consecutive elements. Finally, it prints the calculated result for each test case.
