Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the result of subtracting the product of `n` and `m` from its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, as the code does not consume any input.
