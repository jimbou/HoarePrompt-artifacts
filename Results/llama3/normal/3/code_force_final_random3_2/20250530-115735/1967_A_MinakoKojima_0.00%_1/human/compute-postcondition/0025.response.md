Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is 0, _ is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two input integers, respectively. The list `a` is populated with the space-separated integers from the input. The variable `m` is assigned the smallest integer in the list `a`. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged at -1. The stdin now contains one less input, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
