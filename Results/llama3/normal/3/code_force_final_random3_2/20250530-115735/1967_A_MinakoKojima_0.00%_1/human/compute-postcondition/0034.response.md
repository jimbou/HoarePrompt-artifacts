Output State: **n is 0, k is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list a minus the sum of the minimum of k and m + k // n - a[i] for i in range(n), a is a list of integers from the input where the value at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the smallest integer in a, ans is 0, _ is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `n` is 0, the value of `k` is the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a` minus the sum of the minimum of `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]` for all iterations, the list `a` has been updated at each index `i` to be `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, the smallest integer in `a` remains `m`, `ans` is still 0, and `_` is still -1. The loop counter `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
