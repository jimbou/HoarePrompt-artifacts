Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

The code block consists of four lines. The first line assigns the values of the first two input integers to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. The third line assigns the smallest integer in `a` to `m`. The fourth line assigns 0 to `ans`. 

The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m` are updated based on the input values. The value of `ans` is set to 0. The value of `_` remains unchanged. Stdin is updated to contain multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.
