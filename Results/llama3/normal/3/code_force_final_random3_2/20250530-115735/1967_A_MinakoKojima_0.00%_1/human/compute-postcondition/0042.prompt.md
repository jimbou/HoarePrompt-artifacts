Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a` minus the sum of the minimum of `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the value at index `i` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the first integer in the list `a`, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a` minus the sum of the minimum of `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the value at index `i` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the product of the first integer in the list `a` and the difference between the second integer and the first integer in the list `a`, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a` minus the sum of the minimum of `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the value at index `i` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the product of the first integer in the list `a`, the difference between the second integer and the first integer in the list `a`, and the difference between the third integer and the second integer in the list `a`, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a` minus the sum of the minimum of `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the value at index `i` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the product of the first integer in the list `a`, the difference between the second integer and the first integer in the list `a`, the difference between the third integer and the second integer in the list `a`, and the difference between the fourth integer and the third integer in the list `a`, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
