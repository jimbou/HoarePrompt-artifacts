Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n+1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, then ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is greater than or equal to 0, k is less than or equal to 0, each element in the list a is modified to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n), and ans is the product of the first element of the list a and the differences between consecutive elements of the list a, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is 0, _ is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is greater than or equal to the length of the list a, k is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list a minus the sum of the minimum of k and m + k // n - a[i] for i in range(n), a is a list of integers from the input where the value at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the smallest integer in a, ans is the product of the first integer in the list a and the differences between consecutive integers in the list a, _ is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is n-1, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is either the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, or the product of the first element of a and the differences between consecutive elements of a if n is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, and ans is printed, where ans is either the factorial of n if k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, or the product of the first element of a and the differences between consecutive elements of a if n is greater than or equal to the number of elements in a




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
