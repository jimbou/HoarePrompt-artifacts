Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers.

2. The program correctly calculates the minimum value m in the list of integers a. This is used to determine the maximum number of permutations that can be formed with the given cards.

3. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, the program correctly sets ans to the factorial of n. This is because in this case, we can form n! permutations with the given cards.

4. If k is less than the product of n and m, the program correctly adjusts the values in the list a to represent the maximum number of cards of each type that can be formed with the given coins. It then calculates ans as the product of the first element of a and the differences between consecutive elements of a. This is a correct way to calculate the maximum number of permutations that can be formed with the given cards.

5. The program correctly prints the calculated result for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
