Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list of integers from the input minus the sum of min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is the smallest integer in a, `ans` is the product of the first element of a, the difference between the second element of a and the first element of a, and the difference between the fourth element of a and the third element of a, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
