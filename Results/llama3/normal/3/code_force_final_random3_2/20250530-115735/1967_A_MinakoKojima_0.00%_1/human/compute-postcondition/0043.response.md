Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is 0, _ is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is greater than or equal to the length of the list a, k is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list a minus the sum of the minimum of k and m + k // n - a[i] for i in range(n), a is a list of integers from the input where the value at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the smallest integer in a, ans is the product of the first integer in the list a and the differences between consecutive integers in the list a, _ is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is n-1.***
