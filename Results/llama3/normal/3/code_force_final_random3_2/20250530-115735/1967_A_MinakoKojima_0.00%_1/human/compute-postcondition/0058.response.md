To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`). Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1 and `i` to be 1 (the starting value of the range).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list of integers from the input minus the sum of min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is the smallest integer in a, `ans` is the first element of a, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 1**
