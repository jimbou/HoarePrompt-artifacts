Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a` minus the sum of the minimum of `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the value at index `i` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the first integer in the list `a`, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to the first integer in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still dependent on the input integers and the list `a`. The list `a` is still a list of integers from the input, where each value is calculated based on `k`, `m`, and the previous values in the list. The smallest integer in `a` is still `m`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs. The value of `i` is still `n-1`, which is -1 since `n` is 0.
