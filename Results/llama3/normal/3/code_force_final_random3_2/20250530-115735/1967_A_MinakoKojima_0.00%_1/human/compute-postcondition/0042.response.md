Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a` minus the sum of the minimum of `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the value at index `i` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the product of the first integer in the list `a` and the differences between consecutive integers in the list `a`, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire list `a`, and the variable `ans` now holds the product of the first integer in the list `a` and the differences between consecutive integers in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
