Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list of integers from the input minus the sum of min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), `m` is the smallest integer in a, `ans` is the first element of a, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to the first element of the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The input from stdin has not been changed.
