Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list `a` minus the sum of the minimum of `k` and `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]` for `i` in range(`n`), `a` is a list of integers from the input where the value at index `i` is `m` + min(`k`, `m` + `k` // `n` - `a[i]`), `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the product of the first integer in the list `a` and the difference between the second integer and the first integer in the list `a`, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of the first integer in the list `a` and the difference between the second integer and the first integer in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
