Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`, `_` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the factorial of `n`, which is the first input integer. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, each consisting of two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.
