To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be greater than 0. Additionally, we can set `i` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is less than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is 0**
