Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, m is an integer, ans is an integer, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus n+1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If k is greater than or equal to the product of n and m, then ans is the factorial of n. Otherwise, n is greater than or equal to 0, k is less than or equal to 0, each element in the list a is modified to m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n), and ans is the product of the first element of the list a and the differences between consecutive elements of the list a, and ans is printed.**
