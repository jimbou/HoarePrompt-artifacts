The value of `ans` is assigned the factorial of `n`, where `n` is an integer equal to the first input integer. The factorial of `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is an integer equal to the second input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `m` is the smallest integer in `a`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
