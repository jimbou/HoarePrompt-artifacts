The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is -1 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs. For the loop to execute again `_` is 0 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, k is an integer equal to the second input integer, a is a list of integers from the input, m is the smallest integer in a, ans is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
