Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list a minus the minimum of k and m + k // n - a[i], a is a list of integers from the input where the value at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the smallest integer in a, ans is 0, _ is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `k` and `m + k // n - a[i]`. The list `a` has been modified at index `i` to be `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
