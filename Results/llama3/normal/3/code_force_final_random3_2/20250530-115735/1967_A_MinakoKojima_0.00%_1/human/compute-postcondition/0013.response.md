Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is modified to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in range(`n`), `m` is an integer, `ans` is the first element of the list `a`, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, `i` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the first element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The list `a` has been modified according to the given formula, but its elements are not explicitly known. The value of `i` is still `n-1`.
