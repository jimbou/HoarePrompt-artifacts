Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer equal to the second input integer minus the product of the first input integer and the smallest integer in the list of integers from the input minus min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) minus min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) minus min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), a is a list of integers from the input where the element at index i is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), m is the smallest integer in a, ans is 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers, i is 2, a[i] is m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i]), k is k minus min(k, m + k // n - a[i])**
