State: **`n` is at least `n`, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` and all the values `i` for which `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1`, `t` is the length of `sa` which is `n+1` plus the number of times `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0. `nx` is a string containing the characters at positions `j-1` of the string `xx[i]` if they are not '?', 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'S' otherwise, for all `j` from 1 to `n`, and `nx` is printed**
