Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus 1 and the rest are 0, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus 1 and the rest are 0, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x`, `stdin` contains `n-2` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 2, `j` is `n`**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to the input string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., which is the next input from `stdin`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The number of inputs in `stdin` has decreased by 1, as one input has been consumed to update the value of `x`.
