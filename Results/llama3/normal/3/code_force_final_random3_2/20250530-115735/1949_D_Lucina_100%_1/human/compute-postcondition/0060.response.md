The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is an integer between 3 and 24. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 3, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 2**
