Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 1, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` is an empty list. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `sa` now contains the value 1, which was appended to it by the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
