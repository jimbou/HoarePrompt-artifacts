The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus 1 and the rest are 0, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus 1 and the rest are 0, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x`, `stdin` contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 2, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `j` is `n`**
