Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 1, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 0. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then a[i] is a[i] + 1 and a[j] is a[j] + 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[i] is b[i] + 1 and b[j] is b[j] + 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is neither 'F' nor 'S', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
