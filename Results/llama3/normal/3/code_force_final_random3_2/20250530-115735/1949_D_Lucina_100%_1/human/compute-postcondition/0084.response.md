Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus `n`, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus `n`, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3 and `sb` is a list containing the value 3. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, then `sa` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3 and `sb` is a list containing the values 2 and 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `stdin`, `i`, `j`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. The list `sb` has been updated to include the value 3, in addition to its previous value. The list `sa` remains the same as in the initial state.
