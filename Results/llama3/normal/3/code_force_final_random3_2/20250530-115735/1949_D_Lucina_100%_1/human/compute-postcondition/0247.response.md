Output: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 2, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `nx` is a string of length `n`, where each character is either 'F', 'S', or the character at the corresponding index in the string at index `i` in `xx`. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then the character at the corresponding index in `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, the character at the corresponding index in `nx` is 'F'. and the string nx is printed**
