Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `j` is 2, `x` is a string of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` and all the values `i` for which `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1`, `t` is the length of `sa` which is `n+1` plus the number of times `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0. If the character at position `j-1` in the string at index `i` of `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string of length 1 containing the character at position `j-1` of the string `xx[i]`. Otherwise, if the current value of `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or the current value of `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. `nx` has an additional 'S' appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the string `nx` has an additional 'S' character appended to it. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
