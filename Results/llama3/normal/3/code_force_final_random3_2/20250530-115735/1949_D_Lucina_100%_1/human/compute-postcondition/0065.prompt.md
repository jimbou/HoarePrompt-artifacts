Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus the number of times the loop executes, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus the number of times the loop executes, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings `x`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 1, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 0. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then a[i] is a[i] + 1 and a[j] is a[j] + 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[i] is b[i] + 1 and b[j] is b[j] + 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is neither 'F' nor 'S', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 2, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 1. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'F', then the i-th and j-th elements of list a are incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'S', then the i-th and j-th elements of list b are incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 3, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 2. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then the elements at indices i and j of list a are incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then the elements at indices i and j of lists a and b are incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is neither 'F' nor 'S', then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
