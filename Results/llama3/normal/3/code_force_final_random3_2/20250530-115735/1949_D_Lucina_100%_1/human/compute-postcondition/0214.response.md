Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 1, `j` is at least 3 and at most `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j-1` of string `x` at index `i` in list `xx`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing either 'S' or 'F'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' appended to its previous value if `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`. Otherwise, `nx` has an additional 'F' appended to it. `nx` has an additional 'S' appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `nx` has an additional 'S' appended to it. This means that `nx` now contains one more 'S' than it did before, in addition to any other characters it may have contained.
