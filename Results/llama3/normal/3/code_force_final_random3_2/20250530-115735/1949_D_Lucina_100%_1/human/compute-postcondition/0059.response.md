Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 2, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 1. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'F', then the i-th and j-th elements of list a are incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 in string x is 'S', then the i-th and j-th elements of list b are incremented by 1.***
