Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is within the range from 2 to `n + 1`, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` and `i`, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1`, `t` is the length of `sa` which is `n+2`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, then `sa` contains the values from 1 to `n+1`, `i`, and `i`, and `t` is the length of `sa` which is `n+3`.***
