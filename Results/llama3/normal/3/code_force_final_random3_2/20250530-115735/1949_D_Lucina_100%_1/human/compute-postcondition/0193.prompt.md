Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] and a[j] are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index j-1 of string x plus n, b is a list of n+1 integers where b[i] and b[j] are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index j-1 of string x plus n, xx is a list containing an empty string and n strings x, stdin contains 0 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., i is n+1, j is n+1, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., sa is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where a[i] is greater than 0 and b[i] is 0, sb is a list containing the values from 1 to n+1 where b[i] is greater than 0 and a[i] is 0. The length of sa is less than the length of sb.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 1, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sb` also contains the value 1. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 2, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sb` also contains the value 1 and 2. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `sb` also contains the value 3. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
