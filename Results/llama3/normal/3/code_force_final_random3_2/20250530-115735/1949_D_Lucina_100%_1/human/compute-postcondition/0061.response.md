Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th and j-th elements are incremented by 1, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 3, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 2**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `b`, `xx`, `i`, `j`, `x`, and stdin remain unchanged. The only modification is in the list `a`, where the elements at indices `i` and `j` are incremented by 1.
