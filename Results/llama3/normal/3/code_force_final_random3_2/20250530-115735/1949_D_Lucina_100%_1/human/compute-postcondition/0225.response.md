Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `nx` is a string of length 1 containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `stdin`, `i`, `j`, `x`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged. The value of `nx` is updated to be a string of length 1, containing the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in the list `xx`. This character is either F, S, or ., since the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.
