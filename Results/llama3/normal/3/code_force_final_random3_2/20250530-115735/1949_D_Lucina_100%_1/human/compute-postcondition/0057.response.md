Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i is incremented by 1 and the element at index j is incremented by 1, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 2, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 1**

The code increments the elements at indices i and j in list b by 1, leaving all other variables unchanged.
