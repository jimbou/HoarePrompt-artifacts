Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 1, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0 and also contains the value 1, The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. The current value of `a[i]` is 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been appended to the list `sb`, resulting in `sb` containing the value 1 in addition to the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0. The length of `sa` is still less than the length of `sb`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
