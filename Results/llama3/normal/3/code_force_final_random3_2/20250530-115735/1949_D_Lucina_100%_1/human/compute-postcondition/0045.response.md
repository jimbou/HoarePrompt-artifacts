The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus the number of times the loop executes, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus the number of times the loop executes, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings `x`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains `n-2` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..**
