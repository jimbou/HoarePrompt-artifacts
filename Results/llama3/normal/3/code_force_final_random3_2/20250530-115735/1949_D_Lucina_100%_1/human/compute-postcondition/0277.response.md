Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It first reads an integer n, followed by n strings of length n, each containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .. The function then analyzes the input strings, counting the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each string and each position. Based on these counts, it creates two lists, sa and sb, containing the indices of strings and positions with only 'F' or only 'S', respectively. If the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb, the function replaces '?' characters in the input strings with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in sa. Otherwise, it replaces '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in sb. Finally, the function prints the modified strings.**
