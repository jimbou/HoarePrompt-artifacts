Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus the number of times the loop executes, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus the number of times the loop executes, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings `x`, `i` is 3, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, between 3 and 24. The lists `a` and `b` still contain `n+1` integers, where each integer represents the count of 'F' and 'S' characters at specific indices in the string `x`, plus the number of loop executions. The list `xx` now contains an empty string and two strings `x`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The string `x` has been updated to a new string of length `n`, containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .. The stdin now contains `n-3` inputs, each a string of length `n` with the same character constraints.
