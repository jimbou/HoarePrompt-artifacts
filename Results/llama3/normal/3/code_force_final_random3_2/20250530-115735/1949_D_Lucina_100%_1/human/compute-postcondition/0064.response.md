Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and two strings x, i is 3, j is 3, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., n must be greater than 2. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then the elements at indices i and j of list a are incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then the elements at indices i and j of lists a and b are incremented by 1. If the character at index j-1 of string x is neither 'F' nor 'S', then no changes are made.***
