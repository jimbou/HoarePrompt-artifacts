Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings `x`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains `n-3` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `n` must be greater than 0. The current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F'.**
