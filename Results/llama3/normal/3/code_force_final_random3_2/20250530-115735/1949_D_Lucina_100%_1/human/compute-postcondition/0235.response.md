Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is a string of length 2 containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]` and 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is a string containing either 'S' and 'S' or 'F' and 'S'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S' and 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' and 'S'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `nx` is updated by appending 'S' to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `nx` is now 2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is a string of length 2 containing the character `xx[i][j - 1]` and 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is a string containing either 'S' and 'S' or 'F' and 'S'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S' and 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' and 'S'.
