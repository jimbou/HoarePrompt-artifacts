Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `b` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `stdin` contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., `i` is 1, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] and a[j] are 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F'. Otherwise, b is a list of n+1 zeros except for the i-th and j-th elements which are both 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros. The rest of the variables remain unchanged: xx is a list containing an empty string, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., i is 1, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., j is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] and a[j] are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F'. Otherwise, a is a list of n+1 zeros except for the i-th and j-th elements which are both 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros. b is a list of n+1 integers where b[i] and b[j] are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F' or 'S', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[i] and b[j] are 2 and the rest are 0. xx is a list containing an empty string, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., i is 1, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., j is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] and a[j] are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F'. Otherwise, a is a list of n+1 zeros except for the i-th and j-th elements which are both 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then a[i] and a[j] are 1 plus their original values. `b` is a list of n+1 integers where b[i] and b[j] are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F' or 'S', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[i] and b[j] are 2 and the rest are 0. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[i] and b[j] are updated to 3. `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `stdin` contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., `i` is 1, `x` is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., `j` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
