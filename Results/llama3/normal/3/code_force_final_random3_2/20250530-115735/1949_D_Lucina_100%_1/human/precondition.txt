stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (2 <= n <= 24), and the next n inputs are strings of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j. At most floor(n/2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.
