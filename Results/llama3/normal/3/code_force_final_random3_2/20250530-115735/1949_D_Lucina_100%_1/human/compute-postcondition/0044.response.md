Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus the number of times the loop executes, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus the number of times the loop executes, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and two strings `x`, `i` is 2, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains `n-2` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..**

In this output state, the list `xx` now contains two strings: an empty string and the string `x`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `n-2` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..
