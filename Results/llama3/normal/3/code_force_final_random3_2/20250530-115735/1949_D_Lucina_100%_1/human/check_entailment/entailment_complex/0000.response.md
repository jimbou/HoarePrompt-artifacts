Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes it, and prints the results. The program first reads an integer n, followed by n strings of length n, each containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .. It then analyzes the input strings, counting the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in each string and each position. Based on these counts, it creates two lists, sa and sb, containing the indices of strings and positions with only 'F' or only 'S', respectively.

The program then replaces '?' characters in the input strings with 'F' or 'S' based on the indices in sa or sb, depending on which list is longer. This replacement is done in a way that ensures that no more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type are consecutive, as required by the problem statement.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The use of lists sa and sb to keep track of the indices of strings and positions with only 'F' or only 'S' is a good approach, and the replacement of '?' characters based on these lists is done correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
