Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is a string of length 2, where the second character is `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is a string of length 2. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then the first character of `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, the first character of `nx` is 'F'.***
