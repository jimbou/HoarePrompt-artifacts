Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] and a[j] are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F'. Otherwise, a is a list of n+1 zeros except for the i-th and j-th elements which are both 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise a is a list of n+1 zeros. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F', then a[i] and a[j] are 1 plus their original values. `b` is a list of n+1 integers where b[i] and b[j] are 2 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F' or 'S', otherwise b is a list of n+1 integers where b[i] and b[j] are 2 and the rest are 0. If the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', then b[i] and b[j] are updated to 3. `xx` is a list containing an empty string, `stdin` contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., `i` is 1, `x` is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., `j` is 3.**
