Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. `nx` is a string containing 'S'. The character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` of `xx` is '?'. The current value of `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or the current value of `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `nx` has been updated to 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`, the values of `i` and `j`, and the character at index `j-1` of the string at index `i` of `xx` are still valid.
