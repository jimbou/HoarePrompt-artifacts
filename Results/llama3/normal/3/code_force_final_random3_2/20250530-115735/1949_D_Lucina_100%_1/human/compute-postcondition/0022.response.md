Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers where `a[i]` and `a[j]` are the number of times the character 'F' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus 1 and the rest are 0, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where `b[i]` and `b[j]` are the number of times the character 'S' appears at index `j-1` of string `x` plus 1 and the rest are 0, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and the string `x`, `stdin` contains `n-1` inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 1, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `j` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `xx` now contains two elements: an empty string and the string `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The input buffer `stdin` still contains `n-1` strings of length `n`, each containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `j` retain their original values.
