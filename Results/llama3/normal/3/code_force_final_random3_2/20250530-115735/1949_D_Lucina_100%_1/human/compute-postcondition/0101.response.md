Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `j` is `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` and all the values `i` for which `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1`, `t` is the length of `sa` which is `n+1` plus the number of times `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `nx` is an empty string.**

The code assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 0 inputs.
