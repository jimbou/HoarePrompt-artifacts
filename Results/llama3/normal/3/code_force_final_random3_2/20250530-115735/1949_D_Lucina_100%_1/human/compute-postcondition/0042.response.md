Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string and the string x, stdin contains n-2 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., i is 2, j is 3. If x[j - 1] is 'F', then a[i] and a[j] are incremented by 1. If x[j - 1] is not 'F', then a[i] and a[j] are updated based on the number of times the character 'F' appears at index j-1 of string x, and b[i] and b[j] are updated based on the number of times the character 'S' appears at index j-1 of string x. The current value of x[j - 1] is either 'F', 'S', or not equal to 'F' or 'S'.***
