To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

Since `n` is not changed by the loop, its state remains the same: `n` is at least 1.

The other variables in the state (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`, `t`, `x`, and `nx`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `j` is 2, `x` is a string of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` and all the values `i` for which `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1`, `t` is the length of `sa` which is `n+1` plus the number of times `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string of length 1 containing the character at position `j-1` of the string `x` at index `i` in the list `xx`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
