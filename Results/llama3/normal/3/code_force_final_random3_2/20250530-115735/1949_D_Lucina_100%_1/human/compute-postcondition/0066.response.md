Output State: **n is an integer between 3 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 integers, xx is a list containing an empty string, two strings, and a string x of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., i is 3, j is n+1, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., stdin contains n-3 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n remains between 3 and 24. The lists a and b still contain n+1 integers each. The list xx now contains an empty string, two strings, and the string x of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .. The values of i and j remain 3 and n+1, respectively. The string x still has a length of n and contains only the characters F, S, ?, and .. The stdin still contains n-3 inputs, each being a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..
