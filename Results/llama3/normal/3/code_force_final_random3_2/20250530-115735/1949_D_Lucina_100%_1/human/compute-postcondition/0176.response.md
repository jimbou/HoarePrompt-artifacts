Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `j` is 3, `x` is a string of length `n`, `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` and all the values `i` for which `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1`, `t` is the length of `sa` which is `n+1` plus the number of times `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string of length 1 containing the character at position `j-1` of the string `x` at index `i` in the list `xx`. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is '?', then `nx` is a string of length 2 containing the character at position `j-1` of the string `x` at index `i` in the list `xx` followed by 'F' if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, otherwise `nx` is a string of length 2 containing the character at position `j-1` of the string `x` at index `i` in the list `xx` followed by 'S'. If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is appended with 'F', otherwise `nx` is appended with 'S'.***
