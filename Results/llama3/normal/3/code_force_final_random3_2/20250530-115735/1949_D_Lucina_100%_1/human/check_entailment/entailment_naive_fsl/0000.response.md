Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of undecided transition videos is more than n // 4 - 1. In this case, the program will assign 'F' or 'S' to the undecided videos based on the number of 'F's and 'S's in the input, but it does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will not have more than ceil(3n/4) videos of the same type in a row.

For example, consider the input:

6
.?F???
?.???
??.???
???.???
????.???
?????.?

The program will assign 'F' to the undecided videos in the first row, resulting in the sequence:

.FFFFF

However, this sequence has 5 'F's in a row, which is more than ceil(3*6/4) = 4. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this case.

Note that the program may work correctly for some inputs, but it does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs, which is why the correctness is **False**.
