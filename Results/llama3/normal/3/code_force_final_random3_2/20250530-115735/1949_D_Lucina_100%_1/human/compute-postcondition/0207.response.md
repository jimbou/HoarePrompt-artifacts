Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers, `xx` is a list containing an empty string and `n` strings `x`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs: strings of length `n`, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `i` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `n+1`, `x` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ., `sa` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0, `sb` is a list containing the values from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx` is not '?', then `nx` is a string containing the character at position `j-1` of string `x` at index `i` in list `xx`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string containing either 'S' or 'F'. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'. `nx` is appended with the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `nx` is appended with the character at position `j-1` of the string at index `i` in `xx`. This means that `nx` now contains the original string plus the additional character. All other variables remain unchanged.
