The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n+1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1 and n is an integer between 2 and 24. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 and it must be less than n+1.
State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 integers where a[i] and a[j] are 1 and the rest are 0 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'F'. Otherwise, b is a list of n+1 zeros except for the i-th and j-th elements which are both 1 if the character at index j-1 of string x is 'S', otherwise b is a list of n+1 zeros. The rest of the variables remain unchanged: xx is a list containing an empty string, stdin contains n-1 inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., i is 1, x is a string of length n containing only the characters F, S, ?, and .., j is 2**
