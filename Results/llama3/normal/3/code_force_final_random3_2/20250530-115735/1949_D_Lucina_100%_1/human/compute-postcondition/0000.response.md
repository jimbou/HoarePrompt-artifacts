Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24, a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 zeros, xx is a list containing an empty string, stdin contains n inputs: strings of length n, each string containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 2 and 24, `n` becomes an integer between 2 and 24. The second line creates a list `a` of `n+1` zeros. The third line creates a list `b` of `n+1` zeros. The fourth line creates a list `xx` containing an empty string. The remaining `n` inputs in stdin are strings of length `n`, each containing only the characters F, S, ?, and ..
