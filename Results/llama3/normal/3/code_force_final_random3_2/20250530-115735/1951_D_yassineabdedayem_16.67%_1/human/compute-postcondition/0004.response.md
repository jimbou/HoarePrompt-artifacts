Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` are calculated based on the values of `n` and `k`. `Min` is the minimum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k` itself, while `Max` is the maximum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k` itself. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but with one less line than initially.
