Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the minimum of n // k and k, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to be the minimum of `n` divided by `k` and `k`. The value of `k` has been updated to be `k` minus the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
