Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is a positive integer and n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, _ is 2, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is k - Min.**

In this output state, the value of `number` has been updated to be the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, which is the value of `Max`. The value of `k` has been updated to be `k - Min`, where `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
