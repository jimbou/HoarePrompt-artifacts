The code snippet reads a line from stdin, which contains two space-separated integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. It then initializes three variables: `rep` to 0, `number` to 0, and `tab` to an empty list.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, number is 0, tab is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially)**
