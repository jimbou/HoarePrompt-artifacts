Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, k is greater than or equal to 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of numbers, _ is 1, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and stdin is empty. If k equals 0, the loop has finished executing, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is the number of string representations of numbers in the list is being printed. The loop has iterated over all elements in the list tab, printing each string representation of a number followed by a space. If k is greater than 0, 'NO' is being printed.***
