Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether it's possible to buy a certain number of jewels with a given number of coins. For each test case, it attempts to find a combination of purchases that results in the desired number of jewels. If successful, it prints 'YES' along with the number of purchases and the specific purchases made. If unsuccessful, it prints 'NO'. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been read from stdin.**
