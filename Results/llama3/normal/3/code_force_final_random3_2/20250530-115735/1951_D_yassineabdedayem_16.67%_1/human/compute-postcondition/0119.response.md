To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the list `tab`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, and `index` is 1.

For the loop to be executed one more time, the list `tab` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list. The `index` variable is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, so we cannot adjust its state.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), `tab` is a list containing string representations of numbers that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 2, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `k` is 0, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list `tab` which is `[len(tab)]` is being printed, `i` is the third element in the list, and the third element of the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed, and the third element of the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed again, followed by a space**
