The code prints the length of the list `tab`, which contains the string representation of the number repeated `rep` times. Since `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), the length of `tab` will be equal to `rep`. Therefore, the output will be the value of `rep`.

Output: **rep (where rep is an integer between 1 and 60)**
