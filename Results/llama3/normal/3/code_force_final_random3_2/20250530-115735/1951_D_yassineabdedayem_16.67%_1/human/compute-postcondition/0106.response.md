Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than or equal to k, rep is 3, tab is a list containing a string representation of number and the string representation of number and the string representation of number, _ is 2, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. If Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, and k is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k subtracted by the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and k is k minus Min.**

The first line appends the string representation of number to the list tab. The second line subtracts the product of Min and Max from n. The third line increments rep by 1. The values of t, _, and the initial values of n, k, Min, and Max remain unchanged. The new values of Min, Max, number, and k are calculated based on the updated value of n.
