The code prints the first element of the list `tab`, which is the string representation of the number repeated `rep` times, followed by a space.
Since `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), the first element of `tab` will be a string of repeated digits (e.g., "111", "222", etc.) with a length of `rep`.
Output: **the string representation of the number repeated rep times (where rep is a value between 1 and 60)**
