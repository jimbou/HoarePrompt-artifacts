Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is 0, and stdin is empty**

The code block first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. This empties stdin. The initial values of `t`, `_`, `Min`, `Max`, and the relationship between `n * Min` and `k` are not affected by the code. The variables `rep`, `number`, and `tab` are reset to 0, 0, and an empty list, respectively.
