Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing string representations of numbers, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, and stdin is empty. The current value of k is 0, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is [len(tab)] is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing string representations of numbers that must have at least 1 element, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, and stdin is empty. The current value of k is 0, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is [len(tab)] is being printed, i is the first element in the list, index is 0, and the first element of the list tab which is i is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing string representations of numbers that must have at least 2 elements, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, and stdin is empty. The current value of k is 0, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is [len(tab)] is being printed, i is the second element in the list, index is 1, the second element of the list tab which is i is being printed, and the second element of the list tab which is i is being printed again, followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), `tab` is a list containing string representations of numbers that must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 2, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `k` is 0, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list `tab` which is `[len(tab)]` is being printed, `i` is the third element in the list, and the third element of the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed, and the third element of the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed again, followed by a space, and the third element of the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed again, followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
