Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of numbers, `_` is 1, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k`, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list `tab` which is the number of string representations of numbers in the list is being printed. The loop has iterated over all elements in the list `tab`, printing each string representation of a number followed by a space.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has finished running, and all string representations of numbers in the list `tab` have been printed, each followed by a space. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
