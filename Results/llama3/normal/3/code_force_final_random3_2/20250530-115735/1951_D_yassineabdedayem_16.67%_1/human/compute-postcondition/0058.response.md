Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, k is greater than 0, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and number is either the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k if Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k otherwise, and stdin is empty. If Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 1. Otherwise, k is set to k - Min.**

In this output state, the value of `tab` has been updated to include the string representation of `number`. The value of `n` has been decreased by `Min * Max`. The value of `rep` has been incremented by 1. The values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated based on the new value of `n`. The value of `k` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the problem. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The value of `t` remains unchanged. The value of `stdin` remains empty.
