Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program uses a greedy approach to find the prices for the stalls.

The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice has (n) and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (k).

The program then enters a while loop that continues until n becomes 0, k becomes 0, or the number of stalls (rep) reaches 60. Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum and maximum possible prices for the current stall based on the current values of n and k.

If the maximum price is equal to k and the product of n and the minimum price is less than or equal to k, it sets the price for the current stall to the minimum price and subtracts the product of the minimum price and k from n. Otherwise, it sets the price for the current stall to the maximum price and subtracts the product of the minimum price and the maximum price from n.

After the while loop, if k is 0, it means that Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, so it prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices for the stalls. If k is not 0, it means that it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, so it prints "NO".

Correctness: **True**
