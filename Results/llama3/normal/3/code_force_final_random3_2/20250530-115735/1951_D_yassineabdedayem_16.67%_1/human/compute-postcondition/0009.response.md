Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, and stdin contains multiple lines of input (with one less line than initially). If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and either Max is not equal to k or n * Min is greater than k, and k is k - Min.***
