Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is a positive integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `_` is 2, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is 0, and `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated based on the given code. `Min` is now the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, which means it will be the smaller of the two values. `Max` is now the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, which means it will be the larger of the two values. The other variables remain unchanged.
