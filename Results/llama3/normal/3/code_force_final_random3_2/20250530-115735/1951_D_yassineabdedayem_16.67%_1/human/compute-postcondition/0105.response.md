Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2 and `rep` is less than 60, `tab` is a list containing a string representation of number and the string representation of number, `_` is 2, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `k` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` subtracted by the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is `k` minus `Min`.**
