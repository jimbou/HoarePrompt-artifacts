Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0, rep is 2 and rep is less than 60, tab is a list containing a string representation of number and the string representation of number, _ is 2, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, number is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k if Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and k is the maximum of int(n / k) and k subtracted by the maximum of int(n / k) and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise k is k minus Min.**

The code first appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. Then, it subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. Finally, it increments `rep` by 1. The values of `t`, `_`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `k` are updated based on the new value of `n`.
