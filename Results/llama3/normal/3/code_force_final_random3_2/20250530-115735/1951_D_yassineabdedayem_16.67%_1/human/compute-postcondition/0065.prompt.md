Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is 0, and stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and n is reduced by Min * Max if Max does not equal k or n * Min is greater than k, and stdin is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, k is greater than 0, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and number is either the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k if Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k otherwise, and stdin is empty. If Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 1. Otherwise, k is set to k - Min.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the new number, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of (n // k) and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and number is either the minimum of (n // k) and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and k is updated to k - Max if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise k is updated to k - Min.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
