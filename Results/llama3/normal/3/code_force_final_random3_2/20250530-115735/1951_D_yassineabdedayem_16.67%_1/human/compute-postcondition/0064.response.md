Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is less than 61, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the new number, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of (n // k) and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and number is either the minimum of (n // k) and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and k is updated to k - Max if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise k is updated to k - Min.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is reduced by the product of `Min` and `Max`, but it is still greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `k` is updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state, and it remains greater than 0. The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, making it less than 61. The list `tab` now contains the string representation of the original number and the new number. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the updated values of `n` and `k`. The value of `number` is updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state.
