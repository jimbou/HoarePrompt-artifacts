Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, k is greater than or equal to 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 1, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `n` becomes 0, and the value of `k` becomes greater than or equal to 0. The value of `rep` is less than or equal to 60, and the list `tab` contains the string representation of the number. The values of `_`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged. The value of `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` otherwise. The value of `stdin` remains empty.
