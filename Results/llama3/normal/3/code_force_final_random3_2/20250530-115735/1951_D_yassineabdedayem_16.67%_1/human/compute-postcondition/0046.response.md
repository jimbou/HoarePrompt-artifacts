Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `Min` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is 0, and `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the current values of `n` and `k`. `Min` is now the minimum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k`, while `Max` is the maximum of the integer division of `n` by `k` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
