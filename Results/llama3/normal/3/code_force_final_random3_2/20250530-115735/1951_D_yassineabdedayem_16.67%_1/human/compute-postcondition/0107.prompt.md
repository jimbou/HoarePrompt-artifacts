Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, k is an integer, rep is 0, tab is an empty list, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is a positive integer and n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, rep is 1, tab is a list containing a string representation of number, _ is 2, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and stdin is empty. If Max equals k and the product of n and Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of n // k and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is updated to k - Min.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is a positive integer and n is greater than 0, rep is 2 and rep is less than 60, tab is a list containing a string representation of number and the string representation of number, _ is 2, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, number is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k if Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and k is the maximum of int(n / k) and k subtracted by the maximum of int(n / k) and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, otherwise k is k minus Min.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than or equal to k, rep is 3, tab is a list containing a string representation of number and the string representation of number and the string representation of number, _ is 2, Min is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, Max is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. If Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, then number is the minimum of (n - Min * Max) // k and k, and k is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k subtracted by the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k. Otherwise, number is the maximum of int((n - Min * Max) / k) and k, and k is k minus Min.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
