Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number, `_` is 1, `Min` is the minimum of (n // k) and k, `Max` is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and `number` is either the minimum of (n // k) and k if Max equals k and (n - Min * Max) * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated to be the minimum of (n // k) and k, and the maximum of int(n / k) and k, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
