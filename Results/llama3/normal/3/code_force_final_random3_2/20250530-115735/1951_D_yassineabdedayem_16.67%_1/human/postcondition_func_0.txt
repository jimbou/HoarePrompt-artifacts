This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers, n and k. It attempts to find a sequence of numbers that can be used to make k jewels with n coins. If such a sequence is found, it prints 'YES', the length of the sequence, and the sequence itself. If no sequence is found, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input.
