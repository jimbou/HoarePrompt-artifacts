Based on the precondition, the variable `tab` is a list containing string representations of numbers. The `print(len(tab))` statement will print the length of this list, which is the number of string representations of numbers in the list.

Since the exact content of the list `tab` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `len(tab)`. However, we can describe the output as the length of the list `tab`, which contains string representations of numbers.

Output: **the length of the list tab (which contains string representations of numbers)**
