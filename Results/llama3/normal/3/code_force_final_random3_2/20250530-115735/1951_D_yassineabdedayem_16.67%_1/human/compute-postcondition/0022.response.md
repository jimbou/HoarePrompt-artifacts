Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, k is greater than 0, rep is 3, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, the string representation of number, and the string representation of number, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and n * Min is either less than or equal to k or greater than k, and n // k must be greater than 0, n is decreased by Min * Max.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `k` are also greater than 0, as they were initially. The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The list `tab` now contains three string representations of `number`. The value of `_` remains 0, as it is not modified by the code. The values of `Min` and `Max` are still the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively. The value of `number` is either the minimum or maximum of `n // k` and `k`, and `n * Min` is either less than or equal to `k` or greater than `k`. Finally, the value of `n` is decreased by `Min * Max`.
