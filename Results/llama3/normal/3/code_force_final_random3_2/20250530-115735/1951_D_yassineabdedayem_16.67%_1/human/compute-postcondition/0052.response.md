Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and n is reduced by Min * Max if Max does not equal k or n * Min is greater than k, and stdin is empty.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `rep`, and `tab`. The first line appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. The second line reduces the value of `n` by `Min * Max`. The third line increments the value of `rep` by 1. The values of `t`, `_`, `Min`, and `number` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is reduced by `Min` if `Max` does not equal `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`. The state of `stdin` remains empty.
