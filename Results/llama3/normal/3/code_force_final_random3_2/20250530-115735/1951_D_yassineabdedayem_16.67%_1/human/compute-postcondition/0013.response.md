Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0 and k is not equal to Min, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, number is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is either equal to k or not equal to k, and n * Min is either less than or equal to k or greater than k, and n // k must be greater than 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is either decreased by the maximum of int(n / k) and k or remains the same.**

The first line assigns the value of `Min` to `number`, making `number` equal to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. The second line decrements `k` by the value of `Max`, which is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k`, then `k` becomes 0. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. No other variables are affected.
