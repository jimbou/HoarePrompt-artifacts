The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  tab, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list tab.  If the list has at least 3 string representations of numbers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, tab has at least 2 string representations of numbers, i is the second string representation of a number in the list tab. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 string representations of numbers and the i is the third string representation of a number in the list tab.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 3 string representations of numbers, `_` is 1, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k`, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` is being printed, `i` is the third string representation of a number in the list `tab`, the third string representation of a number in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed, and the third string representation of a number in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed again, followed by a space**
