Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, k is greater than 0. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased by 1. Otherwise, k is decreased by Min. In both cases, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and n * Min is either less than or equal to k or greater than k, and n // k must be greater than 0.***
