Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing string representations of numbers, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, k is 0, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).
*   The value of `n` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
*   The value of `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), indicating the number of times the loop has executed.
*   The value of `tab` is a list containing string representations of numbers, which are the results of the loop's calculations.
*   The value of `_` remains unchanged, still 2.
*   The values of `Min` and `Max` become 0, indicating that the loop has finished calculating the minimum and maximum values.
*   The value of `number` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished calculating the number.
*   The value of `k` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
*   The value of `stdin` remains empty, indicating that no input has been provided.
