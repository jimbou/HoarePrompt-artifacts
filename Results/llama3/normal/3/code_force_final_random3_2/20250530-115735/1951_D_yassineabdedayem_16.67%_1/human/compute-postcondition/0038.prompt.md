Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, k is 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing the string representation of number repeated rep times, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k which is 0, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k which is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k which is 0, and n * Min is 0 which is less than or equal to k, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is equal to rep is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number repeated rep times and must have at least 1 element, `_` is 0, `Min` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` which is 0, `Max` is the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, `number` is either the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` or the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, and `n` * `Min` is 0 which is less than or equal to `k`, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is equal to rep is printed, `i` is the first element in the list, and the first element in the list which is i is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number repeated rep times and must have at least 2 elements, `_` is 0, `Min` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` which is 0, `Max` is the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, `number` is either the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` or the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, and `n` * `Min` is 0 which is less than or equal to `k`, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is equal to rep is printed, `i` is the second element in the list, and the second element in the list which is i is printed, and the second element in the list which is i is printed followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number repeated rep times and must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 0, `Min` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` which is 0, `Max` is the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, `number` is either the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` or the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, and `n` * `Min` is 0 which is less than or equal to `k`, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is equal to rep is printed, `i` is the third element in the list, and the third element in the list which is i is printed, and the third element in the list which is i is printed followed by a space, and the third element in the list which is i is printed followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
