Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `Min` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is 0, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `Max` equals `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**
