The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  tab, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tab list.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, tab has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number repeated rep times and must have at least 3 elements, `_` is 0, `Min` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` which is 0, `Max` is the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, `number` is either the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` or the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, and `n` * `Min` is 0 which is less than or equal to `k`, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is equal to rep is printed, `i` is the third element in the list, and the third element in the list which is i is printed, and the third element in the list which is i is printed followed by a space**
