Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input (but the first line has been consumed)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, k is greater than or equal to 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing the string representation of number repeated rep times, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and n * Min is either less than or equal to k or greater than k. If k is 0, 'YES' is printed, the length of the tab list which is equal to rep is printed, the last element in the list is printed, and the last element in the list is printed followed by a space. If k is greater than 0, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, k is greater than or equal to 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of numbers, _ is 1, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and stdin is empty. If k equals 0, the loop has finished executing, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is the number of string representations of numbers in the list is being printed. The loop has iterated over all elements in the list tab, printing each string representation of a number followed by a space. If k is greater than 0, 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing string representations of numbers, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, and stdin is empty. If k is 0, 'YES' is printed, the length of the list tab is printed, and all elements in the list tab are printed in a specific pattern. If k is not 0, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
