Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, k is greater than 0 and less than its original value, rep is 2, tab is a list containing the string representation of number and the string representation of number, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the minimum of n // k and k, and n * Min is either less than or equal to k or greater than k, and n // k must be greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be less than its original value, as it is subtracted by `Max`, which is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The value of `number` has been updated to be the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, which is the value of `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged.
