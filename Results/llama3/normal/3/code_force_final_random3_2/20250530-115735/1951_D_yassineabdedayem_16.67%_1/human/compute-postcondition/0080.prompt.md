Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, k is 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 1, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is the minimum of n // k and k, and stdin is empty, and 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is the number of string representations of numbers in the list is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in tab:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 1 string representation of a number, `_` is 1, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k`, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` is being printed, `i` is the first string representation of a number in the list `tab`, and the first string representation of a number in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 2 string representations of numbers, `_` is 1, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k`, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` is being printed, `i` is the second string representation of a number in the list `tab`, the second string representation of a number in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed, and the second string representation of a number in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed again, followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is less than or equal to 60, `tab` is a list containing at least 3 string representations of numbers, `_` is 1, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k`, `stdin` is empty, 'YES' is being printed, the length of the list `tab` is being printed, `i` is the third string representation of a number in the list `tab`, the third string representation of a number in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed, and the third string representation of a number in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed again, followed by a space, and the third string representation of a number in the list `tab` which is `i` is being printed again, followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
