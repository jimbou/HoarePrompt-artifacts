Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 10 and k = 3, the program will output "YES" and print the prices 3, 3, and 1. However, this is not a valid solution because Alice will only buy 2 jewels at the first stall (since 10/3 = 3 with remainder 1) and then she will not have enough money to buy any jewels at the second stall.

The problem with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the number of jewels Alice will buy at each stall. It assumes that Alice will buy the maximum number of jewels possible at each stall, but this is not always the case. The program also does not correctly handle the case where n < k.

To fix this program, we need to correctly calculate the number of jewels Alice will buy at each stall and handle the case where n < k. We can do this by using a different approach, such as using a greedy algorithm to find the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall.
