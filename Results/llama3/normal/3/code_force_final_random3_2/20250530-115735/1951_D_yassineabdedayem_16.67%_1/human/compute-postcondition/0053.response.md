According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `k`, and `rep`. If `n` is not equal to 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is 1, and `n` is reduced by `Min * Max` if `Max` does not equal `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`. `rep` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `rep` is less than 60. `n` being greater than or equal to `k` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. `k` being greater than 0 does ensure that the loop will execute again, so it does not need to be adjusted. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number, `_` is 1, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` otherwise, and `stdin` is empty**
