Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, k is greater than 0, rep is less than 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 1, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and number is either the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and stdin is empty. If Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, then k is decreased. Otherwise, k is set to k - Min.***
