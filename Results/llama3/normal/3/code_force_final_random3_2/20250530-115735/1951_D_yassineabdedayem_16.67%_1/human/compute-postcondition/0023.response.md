Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, k is greater than or equal to 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing the string representation of number repeated rep times, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and n * Min is either less than or equal to k or greater than k.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `n` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), indicating that the loop has executed at least once and at most 60 times. The variable `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated `rep` times, indicating that the loop has appended the string representation of `number` to the list `tab` in each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.
