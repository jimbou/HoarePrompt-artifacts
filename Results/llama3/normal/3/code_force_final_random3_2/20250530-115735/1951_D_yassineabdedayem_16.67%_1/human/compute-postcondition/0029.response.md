To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and the list `tab`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list `tab` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. 

Before the loop starts, the length of the tab list is equal to rep, which is between 1 and 60 (inclusive). This means that the list `tab` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. 

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `tab` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number repeated rep times and must have at least 1 element, `_` is 0, `Min` is the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` which is 0, `Max` is the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, `number` is either the minimum of `n` // `k` and `k` or the maximum of int(`n` / `k`) and `k` which is 0, and `n` * `Min` is 0 which is less than or equal to `k`, and 'YES' is printed, and the length of the tab list which is equal to rep is printed, `i` is the first element in the list**
