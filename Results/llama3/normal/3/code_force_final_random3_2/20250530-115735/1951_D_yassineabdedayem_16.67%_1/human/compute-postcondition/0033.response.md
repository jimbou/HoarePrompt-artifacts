The code prints the second element of the list `tab`, which is the string representation of the number repeated `rep` times, where `rep` is an integer between 1 and 60 (inclusive). The second element in the list is represented by the variable `i`.

Output: **the second element in the list tab which is the string representation of the number repeated rep times**
