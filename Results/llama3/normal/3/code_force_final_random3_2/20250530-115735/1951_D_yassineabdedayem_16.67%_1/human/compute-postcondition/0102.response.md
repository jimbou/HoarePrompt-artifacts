Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 2 and `rep` is less than 60, `tab` is a list containing a string representation of number and the string representation of number, `_` is 2, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the minimum of `(n - Min * Max) // k` and `k` if `Max` equals `k` and `(n - Min * Max) * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is the maximum of `int((n - Min * Max) / k)` and `k`, and `k` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` subtracted by the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is `k` minus `Min`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `rep`, `tab`, and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated based on the division of `n` by `k`. The values of `number` and `k` are updated based on the new values of `Min` and `Max`. The relationship between `n` and `k` remains the same.
