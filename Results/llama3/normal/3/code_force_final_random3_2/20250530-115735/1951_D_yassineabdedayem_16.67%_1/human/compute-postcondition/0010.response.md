Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to k, k is greater than 0, rep is 1, tab is a list containing the string representation of number, _ is 0, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, number is either the minimum of n // k and k or the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and Max is either equal to k or not equal to k, and n * Min is either less than or equal to k or greater than k, and k is k - Min.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still within the range of 1 to 1000. The values of `n`, `k`, and `_` also remain unchanged, with `n` being greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` being greater than 0, and `_` being 0. The value of `rep` is now 1, indicating that one iteration has been completed. The `tab` list now contains the string representation of `number`, which is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, depending on the conditions. The value of `Min` remains the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. The value of `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, depending on the conditions. The value of `Max` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`, and `n * Min` is either less than or equal to `k` or greater than `k`. Finally, the value of `k` is now `k - Min`.
