The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, k is greater than or equal to 0, rep is less than or equal to 60, tab is a list containing the string representation of numbers, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is either the minimum of n // k and k if Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, or the maximum of int(n / k) and k otherwise, and stdin is empty.**
