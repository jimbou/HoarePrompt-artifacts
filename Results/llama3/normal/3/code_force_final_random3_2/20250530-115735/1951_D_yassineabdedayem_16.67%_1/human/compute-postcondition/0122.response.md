Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing string representations of numbers that must have at least len(tab) elements, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, and stdin is empty. The current value of k is 0, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is [len(tab)] is being printed, i is the last element in the list, and the last element of the list tab which is i is being printed, and the last element of the list tab which is i is being printed again, followed by a space, and this pattern continues until all elements in the list tab have been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has printed all the elements in the list `tab`, with each element being printed followed by a space. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
