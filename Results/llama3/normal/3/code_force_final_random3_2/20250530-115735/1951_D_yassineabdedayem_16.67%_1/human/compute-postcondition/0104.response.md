Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than or equal to k, rep is 2 and rep is less than 60, tab is a list containing a string representation of number and the string representation of number, _ is 2, Min is the minimum of n // k and k, Max is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, number is the maximum of int(n / k) and k, and k is k - Min.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `number` and `k`. The first line assigns the value of `Max` to `number`, which is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The second line subtracts `Min` from `k`, where `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, and `_` remain unchanged.
