Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0 and `k` is not equal to `Min`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of number, `_` is 0, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `number` is either the minimum of `n // k` and `k` or the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `Max` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`, and `n * Min` is either less than or equal to `k` or greater than `k`, and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

In this output state, the values of `Min` and `Max` have been updated to be the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
