To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the list `tab`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `tab`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `tab` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list, and `index` is 0.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `tab` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be the second element in the list. The `index` should be 1.

State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is 0, rep is between 1 and 60 (inclusive), tab is a list containing string representations of numbers that must have at least 2 elements, _ is 2, Min is 0, Max is 0, number is 0, and stdin is empty. The current value of k is 0, 'YES' is being printed, and the length of the list tab which is [len(tab)] is being printed, i is the second element in the list, index is 1, and the second element of the list tab which is i is being printed**
