Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{'. If `char` is in `mapping`, then the first character in the string `encoded` is added to `decoded`. Otherwise, the character '{' (because 123 is the ASCII value of '{') is added to `decoded`. `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`. The value of `mapping[char]` is appended to `decoded`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mapping[char]` is appended to the list `decoded`. This means that if `char` is in the `mapping` dictionary, the first character of the string `encoded` is added to `decoded`, otherwise the character '{' is added to `decoded`. The other variables remain unchanged.
