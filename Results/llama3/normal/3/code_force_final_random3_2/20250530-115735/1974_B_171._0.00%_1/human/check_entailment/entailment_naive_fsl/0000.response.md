Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains duplicate characters. The program creates a mapping of characters from the encoded string to the decoded string, but it does not take into account the fact that the same character in the encoded string can map to different characters in the decoded string.

For example, if the input string is "aab", the program will create a mapping of 'a' to 'b', but it will not correctly decode the second 'a' in the string.

To fix this issue, the program needs to create a mapping of characters from the encoded string to the decoded string based on the position of the characters in the string, not just the characters themselves. This can be done by creating a list of unique characters in the encoded string and then using this list to create the mapping.

Here is an example of how the program can be corrected:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
```

This corrected program first creates a list of unique characters in the encoded string, sorted in alphabetical order. Then it creates a mapping of characters from the encoded string to the decoded string based on the position of the characters in the list. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the input string.
