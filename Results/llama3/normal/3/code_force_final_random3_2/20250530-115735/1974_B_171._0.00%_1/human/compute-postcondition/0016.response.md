Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is a list containing the character '{', `char` is the first character in the string `encoded`, `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.**

In this output state, the `decoded` list now contains the character '{', which is the result of applying the `chr` function to the value of `c` (123). The other variables remain unchanged.
