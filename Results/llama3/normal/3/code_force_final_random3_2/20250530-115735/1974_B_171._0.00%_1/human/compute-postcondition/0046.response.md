Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`, except for the key `chr(c)` which is mapped to `char` if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to execute until it finds a lowercase Latin letter that is not in the values of the `mapping` dictionary. Once such a letter is found, the loop will terminate, and the `mapping` dictionary will be updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the found letter and the value is the third character in the `encoded` string. The other variables, `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `c`, will remain unchanged.
