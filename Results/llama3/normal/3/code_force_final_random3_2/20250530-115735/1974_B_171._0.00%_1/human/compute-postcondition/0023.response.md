Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and `c` is within the range of 'a' to 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then the key `chr(c)` is added to `mapping` with the value `char`. Otherwise, the state of `mapping`, `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `c` remains unchanged.***
