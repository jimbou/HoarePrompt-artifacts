To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state.

The loop head is `for char in encoded:`, which means the loop will iterate over each character in the string `encoded`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters.
* `char` is the first character in the string `encoded`.
* `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{' (if `char` is not in `mapping`).
* `c` is 123 (this variable is not related to the loop head, so its state won't change).
* `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what happens when the loop moves to the next character in the string `encoded`.

* `encoded` will still be a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, but its length will decrease by 1 (since we've already processed the first character).
* `char` will move to the next character in the string `encoded`. Since `char` is currently the first character, it will become the second character in the string.
* `decoded` will be updated based on the new value of `char`. If the new `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` will contain the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` will contain the character '{'.
* `c` remains unchanged (123).
* `mapping` remains unchanged.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.**
