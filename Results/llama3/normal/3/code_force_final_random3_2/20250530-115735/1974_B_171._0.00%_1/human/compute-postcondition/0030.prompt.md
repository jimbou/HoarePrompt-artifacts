Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and `c` is within the range of 'a' to 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then the key `chr(c)` is added to `mapping` with the value `char`. Otherwise, the state of `mapping`, `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `c` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and `c` is within the range of 'b' to 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is `char`. Otherwise, the state of `mapping`, `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `c` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and `c` is within the range of 'c' to 'z'. If the character represented by the ASCII value `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, a new key-value pair is added to `mapping` where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value `c` and the value is `char`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
