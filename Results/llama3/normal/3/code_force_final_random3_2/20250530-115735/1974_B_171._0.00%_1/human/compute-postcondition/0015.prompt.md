Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, and `char` is not in `mapping`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 97. If the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mapping`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 98. If the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 98 is not a value in the `mapping`, then `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`, and another key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 98 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 99. If the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 99 is not a value in the `mapping`, then `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 99 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the `mapping`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
