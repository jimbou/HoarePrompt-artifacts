To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`, which means the loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'.

At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is within the range of 'b' to 'z'. To execute the loop again, `c` should be incremented to the next ASCII value.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and `c` is within the range of 'c' to 'z'.**
