According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is at least 'a' and at most 'z', the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `c` is 123, which is outside the range of 'a' to 'z'. So, `c` needs to be adjusted to be within this range.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is within the range of 'a' to 'z', and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.**
