Output State: **mapping has a new key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value c and the value is char, the loop is terminated, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

The first line adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary, where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value `c` and the value is `char`. This updates the `mapping` dictionary with a new entry.

The second line, `break`, terminates the loop. This means that the loop will exit immediately, and no further iterations will be executed.

All other variables, including `encoded`, `decoded`, and `c`, remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The `mapping` dictionary is updated with a new key-value pair, but its existing entries remain intact.
