Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and `c` is 123. `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the string `encoded` remains unchanged, the character `char` remains the second character in the string `encoded`, the list `decoded` remains unchanged, and the variable `c` remains 123. The dictionary `mapping` now contains key-value pairs for all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z', where each value is the first character in the string `encoded`.
