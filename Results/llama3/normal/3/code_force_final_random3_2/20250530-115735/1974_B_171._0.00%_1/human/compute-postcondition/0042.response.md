The only variable in the loop head is variable  c, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is less than `ord('z') + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is at least 98 and at most 123. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `c` is at least 99 and at most 124.
State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is at least 99 and at most 124**
