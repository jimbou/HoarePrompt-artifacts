To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `c`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `c` is within the range of `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. Since `c` is currently at least 97 and at most 122, we can infer that `c` is currently within this range.

To execute the loop again, `c` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state of `c` should be `c + 1`.

The other variables, `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `mapping`, are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is at least 98 and at most 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`, except for the key `chr(c)` which is mapped to `char` if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.**
