Postcondition: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and `c` is within the range of 'b' to 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is `char`. Otherwise, the state of `mapping`, `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `c` remains unchanged.**
