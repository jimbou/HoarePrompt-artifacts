Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and then the character '{' (because 123 is the ASCII value of '{'), and `c` is 123. `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the string `encoded` remains the same, the character `char` is still the second character in `encoded`, the list `decoded` now contains the original value (either the mapped character or '{') and an additional character '{' (which is the character represented by the ASCII value 123), and the variable `c` remains 123. The `mapping` dictionary also remains unchanged.
