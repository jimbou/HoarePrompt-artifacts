According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `encoded`. If `encoded` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, and `decoded` is an empty list. For the loop to be executed, `encoded` must not be empty and `char` is the first character in the string.
State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string**
