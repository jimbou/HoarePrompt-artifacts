#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: `encoded` is an empty string, `decoded` is a list containing the decoded characters, and `mapping` is a dictionary containing the mapping of characters.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that contains all the decoded characters from the list 'decoded', which were decoded using the mapping provided in the dictionary 'mapping'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Decodes a string of lowercase Latin letters by creating a mapping of characters and returns the decoded string. The function takes a string of encoded characters as input and returns a string containing the decoded characters. The decoding process involves creating a mapping of characters, where each character in the encoded string is mapped to a unique character in the decoded string. The function returns the decoded string, which contains all the decoded characters from the encoded string.
