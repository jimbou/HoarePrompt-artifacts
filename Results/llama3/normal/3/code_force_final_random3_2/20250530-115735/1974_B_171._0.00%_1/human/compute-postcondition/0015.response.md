Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables remains the same as in the initial state, except for the loop counter `c`, which reaches its final value of 123, and the `mapping` dictionary, which is populated with key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.
