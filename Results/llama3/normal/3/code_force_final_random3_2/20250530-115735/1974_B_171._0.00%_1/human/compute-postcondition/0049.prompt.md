Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters. If `char` is in `mapping`, then `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` is a list containing the character '{', `char` is the first character in the string `encoded`, `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{'. If `char` is in `mapping`, then the first character in the string `encoded` is added to `decoded`. Otherwise, the character '{' (because 123 is the ASCII value of '{') is added to `decoded`. `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{'. If `char` is in `mapping`, then the first character in the string `encoded` is added to `decoded` and the value of `mapping[char]` is appended to `decoded`. If `char` is not in `mapping`, the character '{' (because 123 is the ASCII value of '{') is added to `decoded`, and the character with ASCII value 123 is added to `decoded`, and `mapping` is updated to include the key `chr(c)` mapped to `char` if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
