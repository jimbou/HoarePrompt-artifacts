Output State: **mapping contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string encoded, except for the key chr(c) which is mapped to char, c is at least 97 and at most 122, encoded is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, char is the third character in the string encoded, decoded is a list containing the value of mapping[char] (if char is in mapping) or a list containing the character '{'.**

In this output state, the value of `c` is still between 97 and 122, and `encoded` remains a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with a length decreased by 1. The value of `char` is still the third character in the string `encoded`. The `decoded` list remains unchanged, containing the value of `mapping[char]` if `char` is in `mapping`, or a list containing the character '{'. The `mapping` dictionary has been updated to include a new key-value pair where the key is `chr(c)` and the value is `char`.
