Postcondition: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 97. If the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mapping`.**
