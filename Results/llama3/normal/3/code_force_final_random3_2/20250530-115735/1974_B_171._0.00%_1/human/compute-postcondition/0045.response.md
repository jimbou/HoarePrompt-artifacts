Output State: `encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`, except for the key `chr(c)` which is mapped to `char` if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.

The loop iterates over the ASCII values of lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. In each iteration, it checks if the character represented by the current ASCII value is not in the values of the `mapping` dictionary. If it is not, it adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary where the key is the character represented by the current ASCII value and the value is the character `char`. The loop terminates when it finds a character that is not in the values of the `mapping` dictionary or when it reaches the end of the loop (i.e., when `c` is 123).

After the loop executes all its iterations, the `mapping` dictionary will contain key-value pairs for all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z', where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`, except for the key `chr(c)` which is mapped to `char` if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`. The other variables remain unchanged.
