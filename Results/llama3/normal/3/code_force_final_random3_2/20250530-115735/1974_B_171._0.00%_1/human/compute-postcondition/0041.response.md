Postcondition: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is at least 98 and at most 123. If the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has a new key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value `c` and the value is `char`, the loop is terminated, and all other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to `mapping` and the loop continues.**
