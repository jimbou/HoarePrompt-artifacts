Postcondition: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 99. If the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 99 is not a value in the `mapping`, then `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 99 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the `mapping`.**
