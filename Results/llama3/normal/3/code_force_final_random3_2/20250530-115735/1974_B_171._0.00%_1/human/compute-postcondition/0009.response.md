The only variable in the loop head is variable `c`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is less than `ord('z') + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 97, so for the loop to execute again `c` must be 98.
State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 98, `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`**
