According to the code, the loop head only contains the variable `c` and the range `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. The loop will execute as long as this range is not empty.

Since `ord('a')` is 97 and `ord('z')` is 122, the range will always have at least one element (97). Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once.

The state of `encoded`, `mapping`, `decoded`, and `char` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is an empty dictionary, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97**
