Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `decoded` is an empty list, `char` is the first character in the string, `c` is 98, `mapping` contains a key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`, and another key-value pair where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 98 and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`**

Explanation: The first line adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary, where the key is the lowercase Latin letter corresponding to the ASCII value 98 (which is 'b') and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The other variables remain unchanged.
