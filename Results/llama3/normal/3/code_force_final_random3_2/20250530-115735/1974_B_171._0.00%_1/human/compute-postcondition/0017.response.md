Postcondition: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters. If `char` is in `mapping`, then `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`. Otherwise, `decoded` is a list containing the character '{', `char` is the first character in the string `encoded`, `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.**
