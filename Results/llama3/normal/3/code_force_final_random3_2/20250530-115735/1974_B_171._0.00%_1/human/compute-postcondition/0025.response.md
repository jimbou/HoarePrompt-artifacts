Output State: **mapping has a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of c and the value is char, encoded remains a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, char is the second character in the string encoded, decoded is a list containing the value of mapping[char] (if char is in mapping) or a list containing the character '{', and c is within the range of 'b' to 'z'.**

The code adds a new key-value pair to the `mapping` dictionary, where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is `char`. The state of `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `c` remains unchanged.
