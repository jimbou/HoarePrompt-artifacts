Postcondition: ***`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is at least 99 and at most 124. If the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has a new key-value pair where the key is the character represented by the ASCII value of `c` and the value is `char`, and the program execution is terminated due to the break statement.***
