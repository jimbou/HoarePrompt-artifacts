The code `decoded.append(mapping[char])` appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the `decoded` list. Since `char` is a character that exists as a key in the `mapping` dictionary, `mapping[char]` is a valid value.

The value of `decoded` is updated by appending the value of `mapping[char]`. The other variables, `encoded` and `mapping`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `mapping` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the character `char`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]`.**
