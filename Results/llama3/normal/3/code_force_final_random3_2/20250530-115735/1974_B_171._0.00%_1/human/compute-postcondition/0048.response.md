Postcondition: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{'. If `char` is in `mapping`, then the first character in the string `encoded` is added to `decoded` and the value of `mapping[char]` is appended to `decoded`. If `char` is not in `mapping`, the character '{' (because 123 is the ASCII value of '{') is added to `decoded`, and the character with ASCII value 123 is added to `decoded`, and `mapping` is updated to include the key `chr(c)` mapped to `char` if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.**
