Output State: **`encoded` is an empty string, `decoded` is a list containing the decoded characters, and `mapping` is a dictionary containing the mapping of characters.**

In this output state, the loop has executed for all characters in the `encoded` string, and the `decoded` list contains the decoded characters. The `mapping` dictionary contains the mapping of characters used during the decoding process. The `encoded` string is empty because all characters have been processed by the loop.
