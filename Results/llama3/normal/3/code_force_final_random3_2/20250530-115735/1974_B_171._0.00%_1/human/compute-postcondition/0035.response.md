To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `c` in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `c` is within the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z')` (inclusive). Since `ord('a')` is 97 and `ord('z')` is 122, the loop will execute if `c` is at least 97 and at most 122.

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is at least 97 and at most 122, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`.**
