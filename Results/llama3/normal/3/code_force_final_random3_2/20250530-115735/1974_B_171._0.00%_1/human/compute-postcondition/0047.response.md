Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the third character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and then the character with ASCII value 123, `c` is 123, and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`, except for the key `chr(c)` which is mapped to `char` if `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.**

In this output state, the value of `decoded` has been updated by appending the character with ASCII value 123 to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
