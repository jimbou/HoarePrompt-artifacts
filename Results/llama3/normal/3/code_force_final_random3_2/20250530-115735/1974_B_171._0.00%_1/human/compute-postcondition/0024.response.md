The only variable in the loop head is variable  c, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is less than `ord('z') + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is within the range of 'a' to 'z'. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be increased by 1.
State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', and `c` is within the range of 'b' to 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then the key `chr(c)` is added to `mapping` with the value `char`. Otherwise, the state of `mapping`, `encoded`, `char`, `decoded`, and `c` remains unchanged.**
