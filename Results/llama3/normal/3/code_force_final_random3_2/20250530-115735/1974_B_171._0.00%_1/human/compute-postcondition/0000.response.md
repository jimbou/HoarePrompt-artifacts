Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` and an empty list `decoded`, but does not modify the value of `encoded`. The initial state of `encoded` remains unchanged, and the new variables `mapping` and `decoded` are added to the state with their respective initial values.
