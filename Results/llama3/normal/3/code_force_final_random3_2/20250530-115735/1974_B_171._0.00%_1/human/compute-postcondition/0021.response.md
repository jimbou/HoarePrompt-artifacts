Postcondition: **`encoded` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters with length decreased by 1, `char` is the second character in the string `encoded`, `decoded` is a list containing the value of `mapping[char]` (if `char` is in `mapping`) or a list containing the character '{', `c` is within the range of 'a' to 'z', and `mapping` contains key-value pairs where each key is a lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' and the value is the first character in the string `encoded`. The current value of `c` is not a value in the `mapping` dictionary.**
