Output State: **N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is 0, and arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of N remains the same as the initial state.
* The value of i is equal to N, which means the loop has iterated N+1 times.
* The list of integers nums remains the same as the initial state.
* The value of num is -1, which is the last integer in the list of integers.
* The value of s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers.
* The value of e remains 0.
* The list arr contains tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers. The tuples are created when the current integer is not equal to the previous integer, and the value of s is updated to the current index.
