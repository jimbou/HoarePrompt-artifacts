To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(N + 1):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `N`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `N` must still be at least 1.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, `num` is the integer at index 2 in the list of integers, `s` is 1, `e` is 0, and `arr` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers)**
