Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers and a number of pairs of integers. It then processes each pair of integers by finding the first and last indices of the range that contains the pair, and prints the indices if the range is valid, otherwise prints -1 -1. The function repeats this process for all pairs in all test cases until standard input is empty.**
