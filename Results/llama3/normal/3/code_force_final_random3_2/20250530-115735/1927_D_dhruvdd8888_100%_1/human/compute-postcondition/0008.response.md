Postcondition: ***N is at least 0, i is 1, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is the first integer in the original list of integers. If nums[i] is not equal to num, then s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 1, num). Otherwise, no changes are made to s, e, and arr.***
