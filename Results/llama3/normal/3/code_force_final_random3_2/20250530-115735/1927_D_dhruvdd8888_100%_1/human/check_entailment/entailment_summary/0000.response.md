Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the length of the array, the array elements, and the number of queries.
2.  It processes each query by finding the first and last indices of the range that contains the query using binary search (`bisect_left` function).
3.  It checks if the range is valid by comparing the start and end indices with the query boundaries. If the range is valid, it prints the indices; otherwise, it prints -1 -1.
4.  The program repeats this process for all queries in all test cases until standard input is empty.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each query and printing the correct indices or -1 -1 for invalid ranges.

Correctness: **True**
