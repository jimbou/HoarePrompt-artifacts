You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list of integers. The second integer is the number of pairs of integers. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of integers between 1 and the length of the list of integers.
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is 0, and arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l and r are integers greater than 0, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is empty.

```

Return Postconditions: N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l and r are integers greater than 0, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is empty.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
