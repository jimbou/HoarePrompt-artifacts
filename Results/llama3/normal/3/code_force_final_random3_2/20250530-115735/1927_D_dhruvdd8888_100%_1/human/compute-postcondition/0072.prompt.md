Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is 0, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, and LA is the last index of arr.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l and r are integers greater than 0, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is empty. If s is greater than l, then if s is 1 or s is greater than r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s-1 and s are printed. If s is less than or equal to l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than N or less than l, then the index s and the value e+1 are printed. Otherwise, the values -1 and -1 are being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is at least 1, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l and r are integers greater than 0 and are the values of the input integers, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is not empty but has one less integer, _ is 1. If s > l, then if s is 1 or s is greater than r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s <= l, then if e >= r, -1, -1 is printed. If e < r, then if e < N or e < l, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is at least 1, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l is an integer greater than 1 and is the value of the first input integer, r is an integer greater than 1 and is the value of the second input integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is empty, _ is 2. If s > l, then if s is 1 or s is greater than r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s <= l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N or e is less than l, then s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
