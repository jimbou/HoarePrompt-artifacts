Output State: **N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + s, i, num) if nums[i] is not equal to num, but since num is assigned the value of nums[i], it is guaranteed that nums[i] is equal to num, so arr is not created.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except that `num` is now guaranteed to be equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, and `arr` is not created because `nums[i]` is equal to `num`.
