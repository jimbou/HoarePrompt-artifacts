According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is at least 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`N` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the original list of integers, `arr` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs: an integer, a list of pairs of integers, and stdin contains three fewer inputs than before**
