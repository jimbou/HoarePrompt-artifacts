The code prints the value of `s - 1` and `s`, where `s` is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers.

Since the exact list of integers is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, minus one, and the index itself.

Output: **s - 1 (where s - 1 is the index of the second last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers), s (where s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers)**
