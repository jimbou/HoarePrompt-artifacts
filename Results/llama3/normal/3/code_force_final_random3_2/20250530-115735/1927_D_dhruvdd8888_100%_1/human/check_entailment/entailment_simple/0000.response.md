Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly implements the required logic to find a pair of different elements among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r, or report that such a pair does not exist for each query.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness of the program:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.
2.  It initializes an empty list `arr` to store the indices of the elements in `nums` that are not equal to the first element in `nums`.
3.  It iterates through `nums` and appends tuples to `arr` containing the start index `s`, end index `e`, and the value `num` for each segment of consecutive equal elements.
4.  For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the insertion point `eli` for the query's left boundary `l` in `arr`.
5.  It retrieves the start index `s`, end index `e`, and value `num` from the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, where `LA` is the last index of `arr`.
6.  Based on the values of `s`, `e`, `l`, and `r`, it correctly determines whether a pair of different elements exists within the query's range and prints the corresponding indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
