The code prints the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`. 
`s` is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers.
Output: **s - 1 (which is the index of the second last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers), s (which is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers)**
