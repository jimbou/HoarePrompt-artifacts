Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly processes each test case by first reading the list of integers and the number of pairs of integers, then it processes each pair of integers by finding the first and last indices of the range that contains the pair, and prints the indices if the range is valid, otherwise prints -1 -1. The program repeats this process for all pairs in all test cases until standard input is empty.

Correctness: **True**
