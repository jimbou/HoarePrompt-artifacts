The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the input integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, the input integer is greater than 0 and has one less integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ is 2 and the input integer is greater than 1 and has one less integer.
State: **N is at least 1, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l and r are integers greater than 1 and are the values of the input integers, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is not empty but has one less integer, _ is 2**
