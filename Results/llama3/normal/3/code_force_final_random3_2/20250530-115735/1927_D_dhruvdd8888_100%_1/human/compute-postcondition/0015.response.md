Output State: **N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is 0, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, and LA is the last index of arr.**

In natural language, the output state is: N is still at least 0, i is still N, nums is still a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is still -1, s is still the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is still 0, arr is still a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, and LA is now the last index of arr.
