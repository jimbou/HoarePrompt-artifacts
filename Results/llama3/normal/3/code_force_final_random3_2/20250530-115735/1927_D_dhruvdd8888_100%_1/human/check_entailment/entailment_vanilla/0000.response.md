Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in a given array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program uses a segment-like approach to store the start and end indices of each segment of consecutive equal elements in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array elements `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

3. It then initializes an empty list `arr` to store the segments of consecutive equal elements. It also appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of the `nums` array to simplify the loop logic.

4. The program then iterates over the `nums` array and whenever it encounters a different element, it appends a tuple `(s, e, num)` to the `arr` list, where `s` is the start index of the segment, `e` is the end index of the segment, and `num` is the value of the elements in the segment.

5. After processing the entire `nums` array, the program iterates over each query. For each query, it uses binary search to find the segment that contains the left boundary `l` of the query.

6. If the start index `s` of the found segment is greater than `l`, it means that the segment starts after `l`. In this case, if `s` is equal to `1` or `s` is greater than `r`, it means that there is no pair of different elements in the query range, so it prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints `s-1` and `s` as the pair of different elements.

7. If the end index `e` of the found segment is greater than or equal to `r`, it means that the segment ends after `r`. In this case, it prints `-1 -1` because there is no pair of different elements in the query range.

8. If the end index `e` of the found segment is less than `N` or `e` is less than `l`, it means that the segment ends before `r`. In this case, it prints `s` and `e+1` as the pair of different elements.

9. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that the segment contains the entire query range, so it prints `-1 -1` because there is no pair of different elements in the query range.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct pair of different elements for each query.

Correctness: **True**
