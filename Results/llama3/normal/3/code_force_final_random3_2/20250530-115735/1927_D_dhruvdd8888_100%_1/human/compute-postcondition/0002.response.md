Postcondition: **`N` is at least 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the original list of integers, `arr` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs: an integer, a list of pairs of integers, and stdin contains three fewer inputs than before. The current value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
