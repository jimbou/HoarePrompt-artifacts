Functionality: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers and a number of queries. For each query, it finds the first and last indices of the range in the list where the value is different from the first value in the list. If the range is not found or is outside the query range, it prints -1 -1. Otherwise, it prints the start and end indices of the range. The function processes all queries for each test case and then moves on to the next test case until all input is exhausted.
