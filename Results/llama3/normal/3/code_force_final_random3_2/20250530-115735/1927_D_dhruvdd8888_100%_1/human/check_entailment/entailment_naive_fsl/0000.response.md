Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j. The program uses a combination of binary search and a custom data structure to efficiently find the required indices.

The program first creates a data structure `arr` that stores the start and end indices of each segment of consecutive equal elements in the input array `nums`. This is done by iterating through the array and appending a tuple (start, end, value) to `arr` whenever a new segment is found.

Then, for each query (l, r), the program uses binary search to find the segment in `arr` that contains the start index `l`. If the start index `l` is within the segment, the program checks if the end index `e` of the segment is within the query range (l, r). If it is, the program returns the indices (s, e + 1), where `s` is the start index of the segment and `e + 1` is the next index outside the segment. If the end index `e` is not within the query range, the program returns (-1, -1).

If the start index `l` is not within the segment, the program checks if the start index `s` of the segment is within the query range (l, r). If it is, the program returns the indices (s - 1, s), where `s - 1` is the previous index outside the segment and `s` is the start index of the segment. If the start index `s` is not within the query range, the program returns (-1, -1).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When the query range (l, r) is within a single segment of consecutive equal elements.
* When the query range (l, r) spans multiple segments of consecutive equal elements.
* When the query range (l, r) is outside the range of the input array.
* When the input array contains only one element.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, with a time complexity of O(log n) for each query, where n is the length of the input array.
