Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(s, e + 1)`. 

`s` is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers. Since we don't know the exact list of integers, we can't determine the exact value of `s`. However, we can describe it as the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer.

`e` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Again, without knowing the exact values of `eli`, `LA`, and the tuples in `arr`, we can't determine the exact value of `e`. However, we can describe it as the value of the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA` in `arr`.

The `+ 1` operation is applied to `e`, so the printed value will be one more than the value of `e`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer, followed by the value of the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA` in `arr`, plus one.

Output: **s (where s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer), e + 1 (where e is the value of the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between eli and LA in arr, plus one)**
