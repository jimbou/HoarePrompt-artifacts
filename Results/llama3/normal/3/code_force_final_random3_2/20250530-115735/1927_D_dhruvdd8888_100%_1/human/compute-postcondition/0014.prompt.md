Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs: an integer, a list of pairs of integers, and stdin contains three fewer inputs than before
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is at least 0, i is 0, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1 + s, i, num) if nums[i] is not equal to num, but since num is assigned the value of nums[i], it is guaranteed that nums[i] is equal to num, so arr is not created.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is at least 0, i is 1, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is the integer at index i in the list of integers. If nums[i] is not equal to the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers, then s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers). Otherwise, no changes are made to s, e, and arr.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is at least 1, i is 2, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is the integer at index 2 in the list of integers. If the integer at index i in the list of integers is not equal to the integer at index 2, then s is 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing two tuples: (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers) and (3, 2, the integer at index 2 in the original list of integers). Otherwise, s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
