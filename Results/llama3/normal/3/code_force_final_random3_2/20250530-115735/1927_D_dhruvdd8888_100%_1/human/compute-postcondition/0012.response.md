Postcondition: ***N is at least 1, i is 2, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is the integer at index 2 in the list of integers. If the integer at index i in the list of integers is not equal to the integer at index 2, then s is 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing two tuples: (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers) and (3, 2, the integer at index 2 in the original list of integers). Otherwise, s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers).***
