The code prints the value of `s` which is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, and the value of `e + 1` where `e` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.

Output: **s (which is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers), e + 1 (where e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
