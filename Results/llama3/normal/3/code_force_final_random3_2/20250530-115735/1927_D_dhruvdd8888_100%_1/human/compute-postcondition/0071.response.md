Postcondition: **N is at least 1, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l is an integer greater than 1 and is the value of the first input integer, r is an integer greater than 1 and is the value of the second input integer, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is empty, _ is 2. If s > l, then if s is 1 or s is greater than r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s <= l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if e is less than N or e is less than l, then s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.**
