To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(N + 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `N` is at least 0, `N + 1` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again.

The other variables `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, and `arr` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is at least 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the original list of integers, `arr` is not created**
