Output State: **N is at least 1, i is 2, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is the integer at index 2 in the list of integers. If the integer at index i in the list of integers is not equal to the integer at index 2, then s is 2, e is 0, and arr is a list containing two tuples: (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers) and (3, 2, the integer at index 2 in the original list of integers). Otherwise, s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers).**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be the integer at index `i` (which is 2) in the list of integers `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `num` is now equal to the integer at index 2 in the list of integers, which is the same as the original value of `num`.
