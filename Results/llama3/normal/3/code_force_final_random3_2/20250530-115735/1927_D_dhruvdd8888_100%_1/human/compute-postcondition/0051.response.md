Based on the precondition, the code `print(-1, -1)` will print two values: `-1` and `-1`.

The value `-1` is explicitly given in the code, so it will be printed as is.

The variable `num` is also `-1`, but it is not used in the print statement. However, the value `-1` is printed again, which is the same as the value of `num`.

The other variables and objects in the precondition, such as `N`, `i`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `l`, `r`, `eli`, `LA`, `arr`, and `stdin`, are not used in the print statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output will be two `-1` values, which can be described as:

Output: **-1, -1**
