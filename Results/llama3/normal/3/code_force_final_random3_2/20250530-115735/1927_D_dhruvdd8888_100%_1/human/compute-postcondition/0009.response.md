Output State: **N is at least 0, i is 1, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is the integer at index i in the list of integers. If nums[i] is not equal to the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers, then s is 1, e is 0, and arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 1, the integer at index 0 in the original list of integers). Otherwise, no changes are made to s, e, and arr.**

In this output state, the value of num has been updated to the integer at index i in the list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as per the initial state.
