The code prints the value of `s - 1` and the value of `s`. Based on the precondition, `s` is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers. Since `s` is greater than `l`, `s` is not equal to 1, and `s` is less than or equal to `r`, we can conclude that `s` is an integer between `l + 1` and `r` (inclusive).

Output: **s - 1 (where s - 1 is an integer between l and r - 1), s (where s is an integer between l + 1 and r)**
