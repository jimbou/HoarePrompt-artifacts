Postcondition: **N is at least 1, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l and r are integers greater than 0 and are the values of the input integers, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is not empty but has one less integer, _ is 1. If e is greater than or equal to r, then -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N or e is less than l, s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.**
