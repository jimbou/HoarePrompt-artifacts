The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the input is at least 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input must be at least 1 and the variable `_` is 1.
State: **N is at least 1, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l and r are integers greater than 0, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is not empty and has at least one more integer, _ is 1**
