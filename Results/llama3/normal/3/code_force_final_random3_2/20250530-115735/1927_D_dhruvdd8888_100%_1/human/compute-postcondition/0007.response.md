Output State: **N is at least 0, i is 1, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, s is 1, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 1, num)**

The code block creates a new list called `arr` and appends a tuple to it. The tuple contains the value of `1 + s`, which is `1 + 0 = 1`, the value of `i`, which is `1`, and the value of `num`, which is the first integer in the original list of integers. The second line assigns the value of `i` to `s`, making `s` equal to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
