Postcondition: **N is at least 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional -1 at the end, num is -1, s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers, e is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, l and r are integers greater than 0, eli is the insertion point for (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, LA is the last index of arr, and stdin is empty. If s is 1 or s is greater than r, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s-1 and s are printed, where s-1 is one less than the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers and s is the index of the last integer in the list of integers that is not equal to the first integer in the original list of integers.**
