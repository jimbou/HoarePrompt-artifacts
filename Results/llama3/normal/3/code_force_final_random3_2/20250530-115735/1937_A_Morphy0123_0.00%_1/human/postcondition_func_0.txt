This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the length of an array. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given integer. If the given integer is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 by finding the base-2 logarithm of the given integer and rounding down to the nearest whole number. If the calculated power is equal to the given integer, it prints the value of 2 raised to the power of the given integer. Otherwise, it prints the value of 2 raised to the power of the calculated power.
