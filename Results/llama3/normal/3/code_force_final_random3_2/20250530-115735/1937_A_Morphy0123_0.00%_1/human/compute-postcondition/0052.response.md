To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `power` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 2. This means `n` must be greater than 2^2 = 4.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 2, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**
