Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs, and `power` is not equal to `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n)) is being printed**
