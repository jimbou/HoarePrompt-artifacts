According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2^2. `n` being greater than 2^2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` must be greater than 2^3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2^3, `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**
