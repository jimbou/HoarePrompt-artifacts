The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to `log2(n) - 1`. Since `n` is an integer greater than `2^(log2(n)-1)`, `power` is not equal to `n`. The value of `power` is calculated based on the value of `n`, which is not explicitly provided. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `2 ** power`.

Output: **2^(log2(n)-1) (where n is an integer greater than 2^(log2(n)-1))**
