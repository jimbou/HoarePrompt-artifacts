Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed. Otherwise, `power` is updated to log2(n) - 1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) - 1) is being printed.***
