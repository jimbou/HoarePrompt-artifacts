Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 4, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n_cases` is still between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is still 2, and `n` is still greater than 8. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
