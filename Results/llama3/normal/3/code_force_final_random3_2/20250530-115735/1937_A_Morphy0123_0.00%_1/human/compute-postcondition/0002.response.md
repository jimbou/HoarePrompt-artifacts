Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**

In this output state, the value of `n_cases` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The value of `i` also remains unchanged, still 0. A new variable `n` is introduced, which is assigned the value of an integer from the input. Since `n_cases` inputs are expected, and one input has been consumed to assign a value to `n`, there are now `n_cases - 1` inputs remaining in the stdin.
