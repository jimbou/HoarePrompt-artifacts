Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that `n_cases` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 raised to the power of the base-2 logarithm of `n`, `power` is equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n` plus 1, and the standard input contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
