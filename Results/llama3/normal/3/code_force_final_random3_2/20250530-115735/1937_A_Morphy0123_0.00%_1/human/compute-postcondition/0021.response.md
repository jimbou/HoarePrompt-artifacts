The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to log2(n).
Since `power` is not equal to `n`, the printed value is not equal to `n`.
Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs, and `power` is not equal to `n`, and this is printed: 2 raised to the power of log2(n)**
