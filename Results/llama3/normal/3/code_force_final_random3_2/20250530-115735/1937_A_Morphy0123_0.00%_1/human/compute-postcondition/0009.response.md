The value of `power` is incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs. The output state is: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `power` is 2, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `power` is 2, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.**
