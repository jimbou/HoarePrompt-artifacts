The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`. The value of `power` is equal to `log2(n)`, which is the base-2 logarithm of `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than `2^(log2(n)-1)`, we can infer that `log2(n)` is an integer.

Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** log2(n)`, which is equal to `n`.

Output: **n (where n is an integer greater than 2^(log2(n)-1))**
