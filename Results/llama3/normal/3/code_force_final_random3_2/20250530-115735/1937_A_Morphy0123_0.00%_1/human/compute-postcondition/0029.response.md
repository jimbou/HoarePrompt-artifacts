To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `power < log2(n)`.

Given the initial state:
- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer read from the input
- `power` is 1
- stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs

The loop condition depends on `power` and `log2(n)`. For the loop to execute at least once, we need `power` to be less than `log2(n)`. Given that `power` is initially 1, we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 1.

Since `log2(n)` needs to be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 2 (because `log2(2)` equals 1, and `log2(n)` increases as `n` increases beyond 2).

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2 read from the input, `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**
