Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n) - 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `power` is not equal to `n` is still valid after the code has been executed.
