Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2^2, `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**

The code increments the value of `power` by 1. Initially, `power` was 2, so after the increment, its value becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n_cases` is still between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is still 1, and `n` is still greater than 2^2. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
