The code `n_cases = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases. This integer is assigned to `n_cases`. The remaining lines in the stdin contain one integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9) each, representing the length of the array `a`.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing one integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).**
