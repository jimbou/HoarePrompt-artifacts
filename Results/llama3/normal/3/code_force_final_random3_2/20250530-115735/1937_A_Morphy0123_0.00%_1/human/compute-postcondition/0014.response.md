Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n_cases` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 2 raised to the power of the base-2 logarithm of `n`, `power` is equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n` plus 1, and stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
