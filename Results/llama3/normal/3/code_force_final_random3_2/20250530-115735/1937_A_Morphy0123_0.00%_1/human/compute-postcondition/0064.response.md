Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `power` equals `n`, 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) + 1) is being printed. Otherwise, 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n)) is being printed.***
