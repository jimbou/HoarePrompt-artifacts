To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `power < log2(n)`. The loop will execute if this condition is true.

Given the initial states:
- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an integer and is not equal to 1
- `power` is 1
- stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs

We focus on the variables in the loop condition: `power` and `n`.

1. **`power`**: It is already set to 1, which is less than the logarithm base 2 of any number greater than 2. So, `power` does not need adjustment for the loop to potentially execute.

2. **`n`**: The condition involves `log2(n)`, meaning `n` must be greater than 2 (since `log2(2)` equals 1, and `power` is 1). If `n` is exactly 2, the loop condition would not be true because `1 < log2(2)` is false. Given `n` is not equal to 1 and is an integer, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**
