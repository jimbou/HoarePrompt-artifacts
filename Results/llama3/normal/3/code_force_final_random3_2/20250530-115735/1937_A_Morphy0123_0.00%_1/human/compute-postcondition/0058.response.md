The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to `log2(n) + 1` and `n` is greater than or equal to `2^log2(n)`.
Since `power` equals the current value of `n`, the print statement will output the value of 2 raised to the power of `n`.
Output: **2^n (where n is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n))**
