Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is not equal to 1, `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been initialized to 1. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
