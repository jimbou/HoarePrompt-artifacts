The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to `n`. Since `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), the value of 2^power is equal to 2^n.

Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs. The current value of `power` is equal to `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed**
