The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is equal to `log2(n)`.
Since `power` is equal to `n`, the print statement will output the value of 2 raised to the power of `n`.
Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs, and the current value of `power` is equal to the current value of `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is being printed**
