Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs, and `power` is not equal to `n`**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `power` being equal to `log2(n)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `power` is not equal to `n` is still valid.
