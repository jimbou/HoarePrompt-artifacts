#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9), representing the length of the array a.
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `n_cases` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n_cases`, `n` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n), and if `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, `power` is updated to log2(n) - 1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) - 1) is printed, and the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, and if `power` equals `n`, 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) + 1) is being printed. Otherwise, 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n)) is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the length of an array. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given integer. If the given integer is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of 2 by finding the base-2 logarithm of the given integer and rounding down to the nearest whole number. If the calculated power is equal to the given integer, it prints the value of 2 raised to the power of the given integer. Otherwise, it prints the value of 2 raised to the power of the calculated power.
