Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed.***
