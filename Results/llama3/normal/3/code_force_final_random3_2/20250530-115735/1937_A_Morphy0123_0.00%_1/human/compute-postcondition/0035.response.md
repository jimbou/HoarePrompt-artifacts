Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `power` will be equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and `n` will be greater than 2 raised to the power of `log2(n)-1`. The values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and there are still `n_cases - 3` inputs left in the standard input.
