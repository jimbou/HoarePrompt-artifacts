Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n) - 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs, and `power` is not equal to `n`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) - 1) is being printed**
