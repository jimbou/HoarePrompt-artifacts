The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `power` is 1, so the new value of `power` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `power` is 2, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `power` is 2, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**
