Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the printing of values are still valid, but the value of `power` is now fixed at 1, which affects the conditions related to printing the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` or log2(n).
