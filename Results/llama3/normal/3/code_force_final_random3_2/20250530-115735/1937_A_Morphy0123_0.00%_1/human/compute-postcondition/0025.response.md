Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer read from the input. The number of inputs in stdin has decreased by 1, since one input has been read. The conditions related to `n` and `power` are still valid, but their values may have changed depending on the new value of `n`.
