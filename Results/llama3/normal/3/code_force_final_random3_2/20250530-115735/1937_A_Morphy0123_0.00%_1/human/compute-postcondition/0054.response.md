The variables in the loop head are power and n, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables power and n. If power is less than log2(n), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, power is 3 and n is greater than 4. n being greater than 4 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n being greater than 2^3 = 8. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**
