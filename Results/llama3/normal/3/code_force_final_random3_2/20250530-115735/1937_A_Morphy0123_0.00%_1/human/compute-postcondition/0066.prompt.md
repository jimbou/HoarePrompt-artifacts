Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing one integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n_cases):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        power = 1
        while power < log2(n):
            power += 1
        if power == n:
            print(2 ** power)
        else:
            power -= 1
            print(2 ** power)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n), and if `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, `power` is updated to log2(n) - 1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) - 1) is printed, and the number 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n), and if `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, `power` is updated to log2(n) - 1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) - 1) is printed, and the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, and if `power` equals `n`, 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) + 1) is being printed. Otherwise, 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n)) is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
