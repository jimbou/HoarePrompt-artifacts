To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `power < log2(n)`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive)
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer read from the input
- `power` is 1
- stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs

The loop condition depends on the values of `power` and `log2(n)`. Since `power` is 1, for the loop to execute at least once, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1. This implies that `n` must be greater than 2 (since `log2(2) = 1` and `log2(n) > 1` for `n > 2`).

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the value of `n`, which must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**
