The code prints the result of the expression `2 ** power`, where `power` is equal to `n`. Since `n` is greater than `2 ** log2(n)`, `power` is equal to `log2(n) + 1`. Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` is equivalent to `2 ** (log2(n) + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * n`.

Output: **2n (where n is an integer greater than 2^log2(n))**
