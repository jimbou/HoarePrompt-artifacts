The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`. Since `power` is not equal to `n`, the value of `2 ** power` will be less than `n`. However, the exact value of `n` is not provided, so we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 ** power`.

Output: **2 raised to the power of log2(n) (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 2^log2(n) and log2(n) is not equal to n)**
