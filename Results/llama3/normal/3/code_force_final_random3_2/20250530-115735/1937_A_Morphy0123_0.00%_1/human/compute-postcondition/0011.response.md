Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2^2, `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
