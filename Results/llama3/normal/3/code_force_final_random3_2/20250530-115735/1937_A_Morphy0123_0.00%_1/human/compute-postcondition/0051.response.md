Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs**

The value of `power` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
