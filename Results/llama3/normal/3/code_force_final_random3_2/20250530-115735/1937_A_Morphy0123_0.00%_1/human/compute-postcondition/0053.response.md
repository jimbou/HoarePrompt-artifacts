The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The value of `power` was 2, so the new value of `power` is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 3, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
