The value of `power` is incremented by 1. The value of `power` was 3, so the new value of `power` is 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2^3, `power` is 4, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.
Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2^3, `power` is 4, stdin contains `n_cases - 1` inputs.**
