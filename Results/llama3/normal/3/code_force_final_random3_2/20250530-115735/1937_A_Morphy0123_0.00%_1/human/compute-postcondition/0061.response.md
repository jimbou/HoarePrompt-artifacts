Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n), stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs, and `power` is not equal to `n`**

In this output state, the value of `power` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `power` being equal to `log2(n)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `power` is not equal to `n` still holds true.
