The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `power`, where `power` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`. Since `power` is not equal to `n`, the printed value will be less than `n`. However, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 ** power` without knowing the value of `n`.

Output: **2^log2(n) (where n is an integer greater than 2^log2(n))**
