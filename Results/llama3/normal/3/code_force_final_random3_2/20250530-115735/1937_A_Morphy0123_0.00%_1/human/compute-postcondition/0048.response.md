Output: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n), and if `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, `power` is updated to log2(n) - 1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) - 1) is printed, and the number 1 is printed, and 1 is printed**
