Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is `n_cases`, `n` is an integer read from the input, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `n` is 1, the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1. If `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, the value of 2 raised to the power of log2(n) is printed. If `n` is greater than 2^(log2(n)-1), `power` is log2(n), and if `power` is equal to `n`, the value of 2 raised to the power of `n` is printed. Otherwise, `power` is updated to log2(n) - 1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) - 1) is printed, and the number 1 is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2^log2(n), `power` is log2(n) + 1, and if `power` equals `n`, 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n) + 1) is being printed. Otherwise, 2 raised to the power of `power` (where `power` is log2(n)) is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The loop has finished executing, and `i` is now equal to `n_cases`.
- The input has been fully consumed, and there are no more inputs left in stdin.
- The value of `n` is the last integer read from the input.
- The loop has printed the results for all inputs, and the output is complete.
- The final values of `power` and the printed results depend on the last input value `n`, following the same logic as in the previous iterations.
