Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from the input, `power` is 1, stdin contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.**

The code only assigns the value 1 to the variable `power`, without changing the values of the other variables. The value of `n` is still an integer read from the input, and the values of `n_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `n_cases - 3` inputs.
