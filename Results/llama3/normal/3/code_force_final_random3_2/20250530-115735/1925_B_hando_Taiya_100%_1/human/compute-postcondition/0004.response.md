The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `ans` is initially 0 and `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `x` is a multiple of `i`, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`. 

Output State: **`ans` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` is a multiple of `i`, `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
