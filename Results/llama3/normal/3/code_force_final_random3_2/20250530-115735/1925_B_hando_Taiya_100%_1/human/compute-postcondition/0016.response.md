The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to the integer square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to 9.
State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (9 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 9 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is either 1, 2, the integer division of `x` by `i`, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
