Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (9 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 9 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is either 1, 2, the integer division of `x` by `i`, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 or 3.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` are still valid, but now `ans` can also be 3 if it was not already the maximum of its previous value and `i`.
