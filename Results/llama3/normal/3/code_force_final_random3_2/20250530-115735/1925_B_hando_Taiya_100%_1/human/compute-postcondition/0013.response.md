Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (4 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`, then `ans` is either 1, 2, the integer division of `x` by `i`, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i` (which is 2). This means that if `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by 2, `ans` will be either 1, 2, the integer division of `x` by 2, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and the integer division of `x` by 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
