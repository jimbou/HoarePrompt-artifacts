Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (9 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 9 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is either 1, 2, the integer division of `x` by `i`, or the maximum of the previous value of `ans` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i` but `n` is greater than `i`, then `ans` is either 0 or 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `ans` is either 0 or 3. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`.***
