Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is a multiple of `i`. Additionally, the current value of `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`***
