Output State: **stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 0.**

In this output state, the first line of the code reads an integer t from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^3. This leaves t-1 lines in stdin, each containing two integers x and n. The second line assigns the values of x and n to the variables x and n, respectively. The third line initializes the variable ans to 0.
