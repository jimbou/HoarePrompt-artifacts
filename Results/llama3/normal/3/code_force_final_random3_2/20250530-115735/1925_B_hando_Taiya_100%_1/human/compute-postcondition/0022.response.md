Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is `isqrt(x) + 1`. `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`. This is because the loop iterates over all possible divisors of `x` (from 1 to the square root of `x`) and updates `ans` to be the maximum of its previous value and the current divisor if the current divisor is less than or equal to `n`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
