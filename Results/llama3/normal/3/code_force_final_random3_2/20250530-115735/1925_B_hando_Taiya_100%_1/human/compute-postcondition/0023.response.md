The code prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.
Since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.
Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to n**
