Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (4 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 4 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is either 1 or the integer division of `x` by `i` or 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input, and the values of `x` and `n` are still within their specified ranges. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `ans` is now either 1, the integer division of `x` by `i`, or 2 if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, or remains 0 otherwise.
