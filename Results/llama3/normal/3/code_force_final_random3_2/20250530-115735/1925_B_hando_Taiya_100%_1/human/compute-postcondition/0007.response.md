Output State: **`stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `n` is less than or equal to `i`. `ans` is either 1 or the integer division of `x` by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. This means that if the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than the previous value of `ans`, then `ans` will be updated to this new value. Otherwise, `ans` will remain the same. The values of the other variables, including `stdin`, `x`, `n`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
