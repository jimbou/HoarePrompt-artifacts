Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000, `i` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to the current value of `nums[i]`.***
