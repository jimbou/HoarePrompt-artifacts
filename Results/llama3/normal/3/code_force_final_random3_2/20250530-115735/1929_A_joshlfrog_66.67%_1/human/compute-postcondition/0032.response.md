The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000, `i` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than 0, then the current value of `x` is the current value of `nums[i]`.**
