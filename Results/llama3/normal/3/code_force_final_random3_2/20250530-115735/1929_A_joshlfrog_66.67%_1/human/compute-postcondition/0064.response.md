Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, e is 2, l is the integer value of the input, nums is a list of integers from the input, x is the maximum integer in nums, y is the minimum integer in nums, i is l-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `x` will hold the maximum integer value from the input list `nums`, and the variable `y` will hold the minimum integer value from the input list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
