Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program correctly reads the input, which consists of multiple test cases, each containing an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then finds the maximum and minimum values in each list and prints their difference.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by rearranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the sum of the differences between consecutive elements is maximized when the largest element is subtracted from the smallest element, the second-largest element is subtracted from the second-smallest element, and so on.

The program correctly implements this insight by finding the maximum and minimum values in each list and printing their difference. This difference represents the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
