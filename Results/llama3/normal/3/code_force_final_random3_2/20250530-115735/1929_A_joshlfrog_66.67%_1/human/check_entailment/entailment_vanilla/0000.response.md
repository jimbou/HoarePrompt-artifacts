Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum and minimum elements in the array and then printing their difference.

However, this approach is incorrect. The beauty of the array is not just the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. It is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, consider the array [1, 3, 2]. The maximum element is 3 and the minimum element is 1. The difference between them is 2. However, the beauty of the array is (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 1, not 2.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here is the correct code:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, l):
            beauty += nums[i] - nums[i-1]
        print(beauty)

Correctness: **False**
