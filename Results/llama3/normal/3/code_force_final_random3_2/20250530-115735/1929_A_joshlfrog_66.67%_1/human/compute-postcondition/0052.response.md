Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `y` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is greater than 0, the current value of `x` is greater than 0. Otherwise, the current value of `x` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `nums[i]`, which is less than the original value of `y` (100000000). The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `x` and `nums[i]` is still valid, and the value of `x` depends on the value of `nums[i]`.
