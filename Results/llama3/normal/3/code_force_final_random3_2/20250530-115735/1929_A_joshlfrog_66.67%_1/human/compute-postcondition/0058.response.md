Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `y` is the second integer in `nums`. If the second integer in `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to the second integer in `nums`. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part which is empty.***
