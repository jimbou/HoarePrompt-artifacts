Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. If the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than 0, then `x` is updated to the current value of `nums[i]`.***
