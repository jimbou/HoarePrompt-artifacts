Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000, `i` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The value of `y` is updated to the current value of `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `y` is now equal to the current value of `nums[i]`, which is either less than 100000000 or remains 100000000 if `nums[i]` is greater than or equal to 100000000.
