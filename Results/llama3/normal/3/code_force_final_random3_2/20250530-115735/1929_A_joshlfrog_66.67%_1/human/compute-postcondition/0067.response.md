Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), e is t-1, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums, i is l-1, and stdin contains no test cases, and the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list nums is being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be within the range of 2 to 100 (inclusive), the loop counter `e` will be one less than `t`, the list `nums` will contain the integers from the last test case, `x` will be the maximum value in `nums`, `y` will be the minimum value in `nums`, `i` will be the last index of `nums`, and there will be no more test cases in the standard input. The difference between the maximum and minimum values in `nums` will be printed.
