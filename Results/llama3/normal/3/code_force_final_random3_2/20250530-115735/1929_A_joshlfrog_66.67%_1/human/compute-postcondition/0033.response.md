Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000, `i` is 1, `x` is the current value of `nums[i]`, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `x`, which is now assigned the value of the current element in the list `nums` at index `i`. The value of `x` is now equal to the value of `nums[i]`.
