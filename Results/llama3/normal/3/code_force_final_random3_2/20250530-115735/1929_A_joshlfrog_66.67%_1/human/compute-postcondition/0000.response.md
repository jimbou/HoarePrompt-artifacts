The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line being an integer `n`, this code reads the first line of the first test case and assigns its value to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line is a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` now holds the value of the first line of the first test case, which is an integer between 2 and 100. The rest of the test cases, including the list of integers for each test case, are still in the standard input.
