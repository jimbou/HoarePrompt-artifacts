To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. If `l` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1. However, these states do not guarantee the loop will execute.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `l` to be at least 1, and `i` should be 0 (since it will start from 0 in the range).

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0**
