Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is equal to `nums[i]`, `x` is either the original value of `x` or `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the original value of `x`, `i` is either 0 or the original value of `i` if `nums[i]` is not greater than the original value of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` is updated to be equal to the current value of `nums[i]`. The values of `t`, `e`, and `l` remain unchanged. The list `nums` remains the same. The value of `x` is updated to be either its original value or the value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the original value of `x`. The value of `i` is updated to be either 0 or its original value if `nums[i]` is not greater than the original value of `x`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
