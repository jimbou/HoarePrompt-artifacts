Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, e is 0, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is 0, y is 100000000, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(l):
    if nums[i] > x:
        x = nums[i]
    if nums[i] < y:
        y = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is either 100000000 or equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `x` is either the original value of `x` or `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the original value of `x`, `i` is either 0 or the original value of `i` if `nums[i]` is not greater than the original value of `x`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is either 100000000 or equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `x` is either the original value of `x` or `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than the original value of `x`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is either 100000000 or equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is equal to `nums[2]` and `x` is either the original value of `x` or `nums[2]` if `nums[2]` is greater than the original value of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
