Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is 100000000, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1. If `nums[i]` is greater than the original value of `x`, then the current value of `x` is the value of `nums[i]` and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the current values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**
