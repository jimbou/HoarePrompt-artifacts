Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order, and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program only finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array and prints their difference, which is not the correct solution.

For example, if the input array is [3, 1, 2], the program will output 2 (3 - 1), but the correct output should be 2 (2 - 1 + 3 - 2 = 2). 

A correct solution would be to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
