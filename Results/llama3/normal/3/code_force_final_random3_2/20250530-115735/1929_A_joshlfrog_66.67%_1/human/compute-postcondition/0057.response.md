Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `y` is the second integer in `nums`, and if the second integer in `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to the second integer in `nums`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is assigned the second integer in the list `nums`, which is accessed using the index `i` (which is 1). The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `x` is still applicable.
