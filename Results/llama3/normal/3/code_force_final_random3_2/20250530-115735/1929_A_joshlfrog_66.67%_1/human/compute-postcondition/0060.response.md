Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `y` is the second integer in `nums`, `x` is the third integer in `nums`.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is assigned the third integer in the list `nums`, since `i` is 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
