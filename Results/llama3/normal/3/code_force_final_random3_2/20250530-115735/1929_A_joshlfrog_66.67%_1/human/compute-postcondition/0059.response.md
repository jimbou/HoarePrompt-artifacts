The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `l` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `l` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `y` is the second integer in `nums`**
