Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[2]` if `nums[2]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000, `i` is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the current value of `nums[2]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to the current value of `nums[2]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` is updated to the current value of `nums[2]`, which is either the actual value of `nums[2]` if it's less than 100000000, or 100000000 if it's greater than or equal to 100000000. The other variables remain unchanged.
