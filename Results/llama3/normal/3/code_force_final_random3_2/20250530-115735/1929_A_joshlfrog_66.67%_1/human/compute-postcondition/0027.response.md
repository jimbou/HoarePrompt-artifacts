Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers, `x` is equal to the current value of `nums[i]` which is greater than 0, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `nums[i]`, which is greater than 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the number of test cases has decreased by 2.
