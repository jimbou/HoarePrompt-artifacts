The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `l` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `l` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000, `i` is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` is updated to the current value of `nums[i]` if it is greater than the current value of `x`.**
