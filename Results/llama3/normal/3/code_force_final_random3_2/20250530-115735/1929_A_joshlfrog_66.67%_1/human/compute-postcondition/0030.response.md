Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[i]`, `i` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2. If the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than 0, then the current value of `x` is the current value of `nums[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the current value of `nums[i]`, which is less than the original value of `y` (100000000). The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `x` is equal to the current value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than 0 still holds.
