Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, e is 0, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums, i is l-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be the maximum value in the list `nums`, and the value of `y` will be the minimum value in the list `nums`. The value of `i` will be one less than the length of the list `nums`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire list. The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, and `nums` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The value of `stdin` also remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
