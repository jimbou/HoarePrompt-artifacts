Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is equal to `nums[1]`, `x` is either the original value of `x` or `nums[1]` if `nums[1]` is greater than the original value of `x`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is updated to be equal to the second element of the list `nums` (since `i` is 1). The value of `x` is either its original value or the second element of `nums` if the second element is greater than the original value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
