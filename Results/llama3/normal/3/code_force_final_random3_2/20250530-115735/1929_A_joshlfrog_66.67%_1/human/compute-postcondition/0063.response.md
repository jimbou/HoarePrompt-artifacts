Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2. If the third integer in `nums` is less than the second integer, then `y` is set to the third integer in `nums`. Otherwise, `y` remains the second integer in `nums`. If the third integer in `nums` is greater than the second integer, then `x` is set to the third integer in `nums`.***
