According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `l` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1.**
