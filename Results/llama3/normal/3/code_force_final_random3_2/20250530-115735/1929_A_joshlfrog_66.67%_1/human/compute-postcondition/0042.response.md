Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, e is 1, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums, i is l-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `x` will hold the maximum value in the list `nums`, and the variable `y` will hold the minimum value in the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
