The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. If l is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is l-1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**
