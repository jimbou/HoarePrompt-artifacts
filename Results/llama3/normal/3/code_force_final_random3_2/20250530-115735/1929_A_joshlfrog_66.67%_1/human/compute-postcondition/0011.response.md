Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is either 100000000 or equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `x` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to `nums[i]`, where `i` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `y` is still either 100000000 or equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, but since `x` is now equal to `nums[i]`, we can say that `y` is either 100000000 or equal to `x` if `x` is less than 100000000.
