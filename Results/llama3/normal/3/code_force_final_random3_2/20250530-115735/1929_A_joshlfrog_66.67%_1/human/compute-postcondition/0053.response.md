Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.***
