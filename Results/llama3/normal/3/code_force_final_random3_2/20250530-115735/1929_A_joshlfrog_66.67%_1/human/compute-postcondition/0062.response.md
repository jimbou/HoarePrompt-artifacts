Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `y` is the third integer in `nums`. If the third integer in `nums` is greater than the second integer, then `x` is set to the third integer in `nums`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to the third integer in the list `nums`, since `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `x` is still dependent on the comparison between the third and second integers in `nums`.
