Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is equal to `nums[2]`, `i` is 2, `x` is either the original value of `x` or `nums[2]` if `nums[2]` is greater than the original value of `x`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to `nums[2]`, which is the third element of the list `nums`. The value of `x` has been updated to `nums[2]` if `nums[2]` is greater than the original value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less test case.
