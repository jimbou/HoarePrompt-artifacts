Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be greater than 0, which is the current value of `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
