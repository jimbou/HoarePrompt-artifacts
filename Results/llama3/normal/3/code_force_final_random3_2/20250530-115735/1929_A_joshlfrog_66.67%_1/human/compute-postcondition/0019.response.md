Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is either 100000000 or equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is equal to `nums[2]` and `x` is either the original value of `x` or `nums[2]` if `nums[2]` is greater than the original value of `x`.***
