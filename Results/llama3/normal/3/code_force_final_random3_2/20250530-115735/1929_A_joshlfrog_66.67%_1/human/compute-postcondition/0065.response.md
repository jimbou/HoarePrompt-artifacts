The code prints the difference between the maximum integer and the minimum integer in the list `nums`. Where `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is the maximum integer in `nums`, and `y` is the minimum integer in `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum integer in the list nums and y is the minimum integer in the list nums)**
