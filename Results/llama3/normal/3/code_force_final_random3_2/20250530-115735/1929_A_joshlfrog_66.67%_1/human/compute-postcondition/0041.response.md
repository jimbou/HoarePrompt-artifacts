Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[2]` if `nums[2]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000, `i` is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the current value of `nums[2]` is greater than `x` and `nums[2]` is less than `y`, then `x` is updated to the current value of `nums[2]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
