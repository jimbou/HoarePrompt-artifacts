To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. If `l` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `i` is initialized to `l-1` before the loop, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the initial value for the loop to start. We also need to adjust `l` to be at least 1, so the loop can execute.

The other variables `t`, `e`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` are not directly related to the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0**
