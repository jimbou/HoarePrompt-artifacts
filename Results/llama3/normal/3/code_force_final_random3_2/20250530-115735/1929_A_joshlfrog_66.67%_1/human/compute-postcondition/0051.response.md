Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is greater than 0, the current value of `x` is greater than 0. Otherwise, the current value of `x` is 0. Additionally, the current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`.**
