Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program works by iterating over each test case, finding the maximum and minimum values in the array, and then printing their difference. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by placing the smallest element first and the largest element last, which maximizes the sum of the differences.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the solution to the problem. It also handles multiple test cases and prints the results directly to the console as required.

Correctness: **True**
