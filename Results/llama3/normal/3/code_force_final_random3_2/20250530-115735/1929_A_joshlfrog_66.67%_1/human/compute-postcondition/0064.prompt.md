Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, e is 2, l is the integer value of the input, nums is a list of integers from the input, x is 0, y is 100000000, i is l-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(l):
    if nums[i] > x:
        x = nums[i]
    if nums[i] < y:
        y = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 1, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0. If `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `y` is updated to `nums[i]`. If `nums[i]` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 2, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `y` is the second integer in `nums`. If the second integer in `nums` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to the second integer in `nums`. If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part which is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 2, `l` is at least 3, `nums` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2. If the third integer in `nums` is less than the second integer, then `y` is set to the third integer in `nums`. Otherwise, `y` remains the second integer in `nums`. If the third integer in `nums` is greater than the second integer, then `x` is set to the third integer in `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
