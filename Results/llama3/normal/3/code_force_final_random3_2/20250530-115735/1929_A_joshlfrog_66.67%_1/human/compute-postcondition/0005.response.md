Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `x` is equal to `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is equal to `x`**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `nums[i]`, which is greater than the previous value of `x` (0). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
