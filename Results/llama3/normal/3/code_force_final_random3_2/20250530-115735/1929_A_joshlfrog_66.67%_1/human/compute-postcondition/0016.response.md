Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, `l` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is either 100000000 or equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, `x` is `nums[2]`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to `nums[2]`, which is the third element of the list `nums` (since indexing starts at 0). The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, indicating that one test case has been processed.
