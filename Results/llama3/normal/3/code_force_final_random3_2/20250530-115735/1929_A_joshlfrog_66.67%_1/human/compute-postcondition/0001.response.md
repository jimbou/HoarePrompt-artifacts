The only variable in the loop head is variable  e and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If t is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and e is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line is a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
