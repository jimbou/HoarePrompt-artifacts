Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` must be greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers, `y` is the current value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than 100000000, otherwise `y` remains 100000000, `i` is 2, `x` is updated to the current value of `nums[i]` if it is greater than the current value of `x`, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 100, `e` is still 1, `l` is still greater than 2, `nums` is still a list of integers, `y` is still the current value of `nums[i]` if it's less than 100000000, otherwise it's still 100000000, `i` is still 2, and `x` is updated to the current value of `nums[i]` if it's greater than the current value of `x`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
