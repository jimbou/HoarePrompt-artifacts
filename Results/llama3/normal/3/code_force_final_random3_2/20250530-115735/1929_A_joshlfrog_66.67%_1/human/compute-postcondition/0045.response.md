The only variable in the loop head is variable e and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable e and t. If e is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, e is 1, t is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100. For the loop to execute again e must be increased by 1 so e is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, e is 2, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums, i is l-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums is being printed**
