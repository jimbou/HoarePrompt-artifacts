Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, e is 0, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is 0, y is 100000000, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `l`, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by 1. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, assigns it to `nums`, and again reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The variables `x` and `y` are initialized to 0 and 100000000, respectively. The values of `t` and `e` remain unchanged.
