To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for e in range(t):`. The variables involved are `e` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `e` is 0, and `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.

For the loop to execute again, `e` needs to be incremented by 1, so `e` becomes 1.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `l`, `nums`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, `e` is 1, `l` is an integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `x` is the maximum value in `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in `nums`, `i` is `l-1`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1**
