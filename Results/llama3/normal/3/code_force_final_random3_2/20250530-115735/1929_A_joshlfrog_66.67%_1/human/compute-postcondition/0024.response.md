Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, e is 1, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is 0, y is 100000000, i is l-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y`. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `l`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `nums`. The third and fourth lines assign 0 to `x` and 100000000 to `y`, respectively. The value of `i` is not directly modified by the code, but since `i` is `l-1`, its value changes indirectly due to the change in `l`. The value of `t` and `e` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases - 2.
