Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line is a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for e in range(t):
    l = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    x = 0
    y = 100000000
    for i in range(l):
        if nums[i] > x:
            x = nums[i]
        if nums[i] < y:
            y = nums[i]
    print(x - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, e is 0, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums, i is l-1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list nums is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100, e is 1, l is an integer, nums is a list of integers, x is the maximum value in nums, y is the minimum value in nums, i is l-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, and the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list nums is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, e is 2, l is the integer value of the input, nums is a list of integers from the input, x is the maximum integer in nums, y is the minimum integer in nums, i is l-1, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, and the difference between the maximum integer in nums and the minimum integer in nums is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
