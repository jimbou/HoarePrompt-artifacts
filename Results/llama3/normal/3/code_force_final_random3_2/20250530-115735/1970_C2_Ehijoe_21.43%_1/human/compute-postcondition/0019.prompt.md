Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: nodes is a dictionary with n - 1 keys, each containing a list with the other nodes as its elements, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 2, stdin contains no input, u and v are integers, leaves is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: nodes is a dictionary with at least 1 key, each containing a list with the other nodes as its elements, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 2, stdin contains no input, u and v are integers, if a node has a list of length 1, then leaves is a deque containing the key of that node, otherwise leaves is an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys, each containing a list with the other nodes as its elements, `start` is a node in the tree represented by an integer, `n` is an integer, `t` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n - 2, `stdin` contains no input, `u` and `v` are integers. If a node has a list of length 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the key of that node. Otherwise, `leaves` is an empty deque.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 1 key, each containing a list with the other nodes as its elements, `start` is a node in the tree represented by an integer, `n` is an integer, `t` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n - 2, `stdin` contains no input, `u` and `v` are integers. If a node has a list of length 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the key of that node and the key that was just appended. If a node has a list of length more than 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the key that was just appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
