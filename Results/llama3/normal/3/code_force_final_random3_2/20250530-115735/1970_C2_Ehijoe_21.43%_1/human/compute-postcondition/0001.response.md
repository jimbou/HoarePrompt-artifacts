To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range is `n - 1`). Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but we need to ensure it's at least 2 for the loop to execute. We also need to set `i` to 0, as it will be the starting value of the range.

State: **`nodes` is an empty dictionary, `start` is a node in the tree represented by an integer, `n` is at least 2, `t` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is 0**
