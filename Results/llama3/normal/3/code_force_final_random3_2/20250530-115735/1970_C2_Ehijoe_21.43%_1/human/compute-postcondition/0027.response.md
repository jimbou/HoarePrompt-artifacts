Postcondition: **nodes is a dictionary with n - 1 keys, each containing a list with the other nodes as its elements, start is an integer, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, i is n - 2, stdin contains no input, u and v are integers, leaves is a deque containing all the keys of nodes that have a list of length 1, moves is the output of func_1(nodes, start). If the current value of moves contains at least one odd number, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in moves are even and 'Hermione' is printed.**
