This function calculates distances in a tree represented by a list of lists of integers. It takes three parameters: a tree representation 'nodes', a starting node index 'start', and a parent node index 'parent'. If the starting node has only one child and that child is the parent, the function returns a list containing a single element, 0. Otherwise, it calculates the distances from the last node in the subtree rooted at the starting node to each node in that subtree, with an offset of 1 if the last node is not the parent. The function returns a list of these distances.
