Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary with at least 1 key, each containing a list with the other nodes as its elements, `start` is a node in the tree represented by an integer, `n` is an integer, `t` is an integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `i` is n - 2, `stdin` contains no input, `u` and `v` are integers. If a node has a list of length 1, then `leaves` is a deque containing the key of that node and the key that was just appended. Otherwise, `leaves` is a deque containing the key that was just appended.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `leaves` deque now contains the key that was just appended. If a node has a list of length 1, then `leaves` contains the key of that node and the key that was just appended. Otherwise, `leaves` contains only the key that was just appended.
