The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers a, b, m. After accepting the first integer, the stdin now contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, m.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, m**
