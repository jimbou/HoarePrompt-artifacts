Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The key idea is to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation within the time frame of `m + 1` minutes.

The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` calculates this maximum number. Here's why:

* `m // a` calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by the first installation within the time frame of `m + 1` minutes. This is because the first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes, so the maximum number of fireworks it can launch within `m + 1` minutes is `m // a`.
* Similarly, `m // b` calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by the second installation within the time frame of `m + 1` minutes.
* The `+ 2` is added to account for the fact that both installations launch fireworks at the same time, so there can be at most two fireworks visible in the sky at the same time.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the input values `a`, `b`, and `m`, and prints the calculated maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
