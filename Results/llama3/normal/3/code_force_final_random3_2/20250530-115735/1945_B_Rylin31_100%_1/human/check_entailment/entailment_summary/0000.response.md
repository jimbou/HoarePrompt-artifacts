Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m, representing the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky, respectively.

The program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by using the expression m // a + m // b + 2. This expression is based on the fact that the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time is equal to the sum of the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation in the given time period, plus 2 (since both installations launch fireworks simultaneously).

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and accurately calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
