Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers, `m // a + m // b + 2` has been printed, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing three integers, and this is printed: `m // a + m // b + 2`**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the three integers read from the input. The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` has been printed, and the stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing three integers.
