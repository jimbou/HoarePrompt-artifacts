Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when a = 1, b = 1, and m = 1, the program outputs 4, but the correct output should be 3. This is because when a = 1 and b = 1, the fireworks from both installations will be visible for 1 minute after launch, and since m = 1, there will be 3 fireworks visible in the sky at the same time (one from the first installation, one from the second installation, and one that was launched 1 minute ago).

The issue with the program is that it adds 2 to the sum of m // a and m // b, which is not correct. The correct approach would be to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible from each installation separately and then add them together.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 1)

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible in the sky at the same time by adding 1 to the sum of m // a and m // b, which accounts for the firework that was launched 1 minute ago.
