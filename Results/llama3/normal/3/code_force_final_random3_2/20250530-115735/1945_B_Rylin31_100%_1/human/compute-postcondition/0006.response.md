Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers, `m // a + m // b + 2` has been printed, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of the three integers from the input. The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` has been printed. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing three integers, since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
