Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers, stdin contains 0 lines, and `m // a + m // b + 2` has been printed `t` times.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `t`, the input buffer (stdin) will be empty since all lines have been processed, and the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` will have been printed `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations the loop was designed to execute.
