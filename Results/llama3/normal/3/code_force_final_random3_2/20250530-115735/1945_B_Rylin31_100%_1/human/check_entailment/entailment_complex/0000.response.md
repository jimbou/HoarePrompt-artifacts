Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. The program then prints the result of the expression m // a + m // b + 2 for each test case.

The expression m // a + m // b + 2 is used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Here's how it works:

- m // a calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible in the sky at the same time. This is because the first installation launches fireworks every a minutes, and each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes. Therefore, the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible in the sky at the same time is m // a.
- m // b calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible in the sky at the same time. This is because the second installation launches fireworks every b minutes, and each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes. Therefore, the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible in the sky at the same time is m // b.
- The + 2 at the end of the expression is used to account for the fact that the first firework launched by each installation is visible for m + 1 minutes, not just m minutes. This means that the first firework launched by each installation will be visible for one minute more than the number of fireworks launched by that installation that are visible in the sky at the same time.

Overall, the expression m // a + m // b + 2 correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
