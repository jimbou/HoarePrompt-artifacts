The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing three integers, and this is printed: `m // a + m // b + 2`**
