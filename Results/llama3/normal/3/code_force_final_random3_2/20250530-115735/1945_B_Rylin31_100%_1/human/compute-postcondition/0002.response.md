Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `m` are integers, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 0. The code reads a line from the input, which contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, and assigns them to the corresponding variables. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers, as one line has been read and processed.
