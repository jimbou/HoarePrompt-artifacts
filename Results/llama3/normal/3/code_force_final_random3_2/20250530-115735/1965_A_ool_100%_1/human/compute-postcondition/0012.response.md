Postcondition: ***A is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 3 elements, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, the second element of set_ is x (greater than 1), i is 2. If the difference between the third element of set_ and the second element of set_ is greater than 1, then not_c is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
