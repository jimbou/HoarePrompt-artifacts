Output State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, not_c is False, i is 1, and the difference between the current element of set_ at index i and the previous element at index i-1 is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The first line of the code sets `not_c` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or the nearest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `not_c` is now `False`, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
