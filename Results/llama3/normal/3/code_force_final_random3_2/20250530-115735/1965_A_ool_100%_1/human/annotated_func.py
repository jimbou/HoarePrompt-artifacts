    #State: *A is True if not_c was originally False, otherwise A remains False. set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, not_c is True.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of positive integers. It checks if the list contains consecutive integers starting from 1. If the list does not start with 1, the function returns 'Alice'. If the list starts with 1 but does not contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Bob'. If the list starts with 1 and contains consecutive integers, the function returns 'Alice' if the length of the list is even, and 'Bob' if the length of the list is odd.
