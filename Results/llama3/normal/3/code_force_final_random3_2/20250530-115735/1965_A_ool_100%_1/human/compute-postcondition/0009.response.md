Output State: **A is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, i is 1. If the difference between the current element of set_ at index i and the previous element at index i-1 is greater than 1, then not_c is False. Otherwise, not_c remains True.**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of A has been toggled from False to True. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
