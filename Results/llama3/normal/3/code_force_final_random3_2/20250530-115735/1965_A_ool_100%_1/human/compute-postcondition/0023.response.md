Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of positive integers. It checks if the list contains consecutive integers starting from 1. If the list does not start with 1, the function returns 'Alice'. If the list starts with 1 but does not contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Bob'. If the list starts with 1 and contains consecutive integers, the function returns 'Alice' if the length of the list is even, and 'Bob' if the length of the list is odd.**
