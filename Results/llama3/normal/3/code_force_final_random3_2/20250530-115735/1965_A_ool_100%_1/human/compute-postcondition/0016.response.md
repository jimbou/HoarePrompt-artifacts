Postcondition: ***A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 4 elements, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, the second element of set_ is x (greater than 1), i is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of set_ is greater than 1, not_c is False. Otherwise, no change is made.***
