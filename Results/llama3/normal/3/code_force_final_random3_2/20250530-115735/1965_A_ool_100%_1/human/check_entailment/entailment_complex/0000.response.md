Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given list of positive integers. The function `func_1` checks if the list contains consecutive integers starting from 1. If the list does not start with 1, it returns 'Alice'. If the list starts with 1 but does not contain consecutive integers, it returns 'Bob'. If the list starts with 1 and contains consecutive integers, it returns 'Alice' if the length of the list is even, and 'Bob' if the length of the list is odd.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and returns the correct winner based on the given list of integers.

Correctness: **True**
