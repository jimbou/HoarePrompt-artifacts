Output State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr is a list of positive integers. The first element of set_ is 1, not_c is True**

The code assigns the value True to the variable not_c. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of not_c being True.
