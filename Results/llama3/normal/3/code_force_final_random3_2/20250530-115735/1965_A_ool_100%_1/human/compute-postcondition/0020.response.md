Output State: **A is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, not_c is True.**

In this output state, the value of A has been changed to True, as the code `A = not A` negates the original value of A, which was False. The other variables, set_, arr, and not_c, remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The first element of set_ is still 1, and not_c is still True.
