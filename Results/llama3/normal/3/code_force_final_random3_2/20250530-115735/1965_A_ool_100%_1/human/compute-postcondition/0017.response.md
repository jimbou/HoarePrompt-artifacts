Output State: **`A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, `arr` is a list of positive integers, the first element of `set_` is 1, the second element of `set_` is `x` (greater than 1), `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False. Otherwise, no change is made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `A` has been changed to True, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The list `set_` is still a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` with at least 4 elements, and its first two elements are still 1 and `x` (greater than 1). The value of `i` is still 3. The condition regarding the difference between the third and second elements of `set_` and the value of `not_c` remains the same.
