To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `set_`. The loop will execute if `set_` has at least 2 elements, since the range starts from 1. 

State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, not_c is True, i is 1**
