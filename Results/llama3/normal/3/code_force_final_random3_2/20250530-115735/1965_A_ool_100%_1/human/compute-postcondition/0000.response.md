Output State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr is a list of positive integers.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the value False to the variable A. The second line creates a set from the list arr, which removes any duplicate elements, and then converts this set back into a list. The third line sorts this list in ascending order. The variable arr remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
