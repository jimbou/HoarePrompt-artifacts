Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the function `func_1(arr)`. The function tries to determine the winner of the game by checking if the smallest pile size is 1 and if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are all 1. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

A counterexample is when the input is `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will return `'Bob'`, but the correct answer is `'Alice'`. This is because Alice can choose `k=1` on her first turn, leaving the piles as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Then, Bob can only choose `k=1` on his turn, leaving the piles as `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. Alice can then choose `k=1` again, leaving the piles as `[0, 0, 1, 2]`. Bob can only choose `k=1` again, leaving the piles as `[0, 0, 0, 1]`. Finally, Alice can choose `k=1` again, leaving the piles as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, which means Alice wins.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the concept of Nim-sum, which is the bitwise XOR of all the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is 0, then the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins. The program does not implement this correct approach, which is why it is incorrect.
