To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `set_`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `A` is True (but this is not relevant to the loop head)
* `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 2 elements
* `arr` is a list of positive integers (but this is not relevant to the loop head)
* The first element of `set_` is 1
* `i` is 1

To execute the loop again, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

Since `set_` is a sorted list, we can infer that the second element of `set_` must be greater than the first element (which is 1). Let's assume the second element of `set_` is `x`. We don't know the exact value of `x`, but we know it's greater than 1.

The state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 3 elements, `arr` is a list of positive integers, the first element of `set_` is 1, the second element of `set_` is `x` (greater than 1), `i` is 2**

Note that we've adjusted the state of `set_` to have at least 3 elements, since we know it had at least 2 elements previously and we've incremented `i` to 2. We've also introduced a new variable `x` to represent the second element of `set_`, which is greater than 1.
