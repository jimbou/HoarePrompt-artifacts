Output State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, not_c is False.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, and not_c is False. This means that the loop has iterated over all elements in set_, and at some point, the difference between two consecutive elements in set_ was greater than 1, causing not_c to become False. The value of A is False because the loop iterated an even number of times, toggling A's value each time.
