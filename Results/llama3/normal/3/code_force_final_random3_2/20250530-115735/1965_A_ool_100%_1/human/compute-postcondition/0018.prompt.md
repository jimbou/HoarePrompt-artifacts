Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr is a list of positive integers. The first element of set_ is 1, not_c is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
    if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
        not_c = False
        break
    A = not A


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: A is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 2 elements, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, i is 1. If the difference between the current element of set_ at index i and the previous element at index i-1 is greater than 1, then not_c is False. Otherwise, not_c remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr that must have at least 3 elements, arr is a list of positive integers, the first element of set_ is 1, the second element of set_ is x (greater than 1), i is 2. If the difference between the third element of set_ and the second element of set_ is greater than 1, then not_c is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `A` is True, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr` that must have at least 4 elements, `arr` is a list of positive integers, the first element of `set_` is 1, the second element of `set_` is `x` (greater than 1), `i` is 3. If the difference between the third and second elements of `set_` is greater than 1, `not_c` is False. Otherwise, no change is made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
