To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `c` and `cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `cases` is already a positive integer, we can conclude that `cases` must be greater than 0.

The variable `c` is initialized to 0 in the `range(cases)` function, so we can set its initial value to 0.

State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, stdin contains the remaining input, which includes the test cases, each consisting of three lines: two space-separated integers n and m, and two lines of n space-separated integers.**
