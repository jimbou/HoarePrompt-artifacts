Postcondition: ***cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 2, na_frente is an integer greater than or equal to 0, pos_final is an integer less than its original value by 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, the current value of v is na_frente and is greater than pos_final, the current value of total is 0, the current value of best is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 3 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers. Additionally, the cost to change to option A at position v is less than the cost to pass to option B at position v.***
