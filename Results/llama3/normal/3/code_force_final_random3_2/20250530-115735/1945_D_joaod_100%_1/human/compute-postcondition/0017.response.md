Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is the maximum possible float value, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Additionally, the cost to change `a` at position `v` is not less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to include the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `v` is still equal to `na_frente` and is greater than `pos_final`, and the cost to change `a` at position `v` is still not less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`.
