Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining input, which includes the test cases, each consisting of three lines: two space-separated integers n and m, and two lines of n space-separated integers.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is 0, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for all positions from `na_frente` to -1. `best` is the minimum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and the current `best` value for all positions from `na_frente` to -1, and the best value is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to -1, `best` is the minimum value between the maximum possible float value and the sum of the new value of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` for all `v` from `na_frente` to -1, `stdin` contains `cases - 1` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers, and the minimum value between the maximum possible float value and the sum of the new value of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` for all `v` from `na_frente` to -1 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 2, na_frente is -1, pos_final is an integer less than its original value by 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, total is the sum of the costs of the cheapest option (either custo_pra_trocar_a or custo_pra_passar_b) at each position from na_frente to 0, best is the minimum total cost found so far, and the minimum total cost found so far which is best is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
