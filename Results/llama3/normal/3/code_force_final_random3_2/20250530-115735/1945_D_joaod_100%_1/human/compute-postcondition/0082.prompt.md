Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is a positive integer greater than 1, c is 1, na_frente is an integer less than the original value, pos_final is an integer, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, total is 0, best is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 1 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the element at index `v` of either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which one is smaller, and `best` is the minimum value between the maximum possible float value and the sum of the new value of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by a value less than the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v` if the cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`, otherwise `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, and `best` is the maximum possible float value. `stdin` contains `cases - 1` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
