Output: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is 0, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for all positions from `na_frente` to -1. `best` is the minimum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and the current `best` value for all positions from `na_frente` to -1, and the best value is printed**
