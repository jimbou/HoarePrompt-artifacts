Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. If the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`, then `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the last element of `custo_pra_passar_b`.***
