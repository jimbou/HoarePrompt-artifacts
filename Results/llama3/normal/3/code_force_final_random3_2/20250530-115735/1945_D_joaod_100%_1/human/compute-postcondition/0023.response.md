Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. If `best` is greater than the new `total`, then `best` is updated to the new `total`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the last element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, if the value of `best` is greater than the new `total`, then `best` is updated to the new `total`.
