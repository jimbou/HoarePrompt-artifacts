Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `na_frente` was decremented by 1, `pos_final` was decremented by 1, `total` is equal to the previous total plus the cost to change at position `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, then the best value is updated to be the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`. The cost to change at position `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the cost to pass at position `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The total cost has been updated by adding the cost to change at the current position `v` in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The best value is still updated if the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`. The relationship between the cost to change at position `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` and the cost to pass at position `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b` remains the same.
