Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, no update is made. stdin contains `cases - 3` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to include the cost of switching at position `v`, which is the current value of `na_frente`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the relationships between `v`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` are still valid. The value of `best` may have been updated if the new total is less than the previous best value.
