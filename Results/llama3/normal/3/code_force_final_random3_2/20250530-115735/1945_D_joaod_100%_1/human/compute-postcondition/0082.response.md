Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` from `na_frente` to -1, `best` is the minimum value between the maximum possible float value and the sum of the new value of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` for all `v` from `na_frente` to -1, `stdin` contains `cases - 1` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the values of `total` and `best` have been updated accordingly. The loop has iterated over all the elements of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` from `na_frente` to -1, and the values of `total` and `best` have been updated based on the minimum costs. The other variables remain unchanged.
