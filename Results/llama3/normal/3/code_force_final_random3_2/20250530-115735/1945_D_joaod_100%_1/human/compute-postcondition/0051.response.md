Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente` and its current value is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `best` is the minimum value between the maximum possible float value and the sum of the new value of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `stdin` contains `cases - 1` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the current value of the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_passar_b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost of switching at the current position `v` from the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The value of `best` is still the minimum between the maximum possible float value and the sum of the new `total` and the cost of switching at the current position `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
