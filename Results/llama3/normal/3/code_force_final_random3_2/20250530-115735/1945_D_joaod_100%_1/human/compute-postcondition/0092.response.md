Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, no update is made. stdin contains `cases - 3` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.***
