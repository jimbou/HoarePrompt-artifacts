Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. If the cost to change to A is less than the cost to pass B, `total` is increased by the cost to change to A. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass B.***
