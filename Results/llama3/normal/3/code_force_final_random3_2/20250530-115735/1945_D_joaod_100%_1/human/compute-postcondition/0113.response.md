Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by the second element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `best` is updated if necessary. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the second element of `custo_pra_passar_b` and `best` is updated if necessary. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[1].***
