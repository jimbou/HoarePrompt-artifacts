Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the last element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a` to it, since `v` is -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
