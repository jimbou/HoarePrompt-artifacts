Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is increased by the cost to pass b at position `v`, `best` is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 3 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the cost to change a at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass b at position `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the cost to pass b at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains cases - 3 inputs, and the conditions `v` is greater than `pos_final` and the cost to change a at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass b at position `v` are still valid.
