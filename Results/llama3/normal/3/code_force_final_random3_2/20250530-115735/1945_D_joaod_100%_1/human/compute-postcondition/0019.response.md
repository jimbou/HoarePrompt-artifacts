Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `na_frente` was decremented by 1, `pos_final` was decremented by 1, `v` is equal to `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if the cost to change at position `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the cost to pass at position `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is equal to the previous total plus the cost to change at position `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `v`. If the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, then the best value is updated to be the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, `total` is equal to the previous value of `total` plus the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
