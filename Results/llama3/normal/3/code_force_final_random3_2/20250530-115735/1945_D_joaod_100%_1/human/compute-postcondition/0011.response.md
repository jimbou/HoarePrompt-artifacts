The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the cost to pass at position `v`, which is stored in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. Since `v` is equal to `na_frente` and `na_frente` was decremented by 1, the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Also, the cost to change at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at position `v`.

Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `na_frente` was decremented by 1, `pos_final` was decremented by 1, `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `v` (which is less than or equal to `pos_final`), `v` is equal to `na_frente`, and the cost to change at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at position `v`.**
