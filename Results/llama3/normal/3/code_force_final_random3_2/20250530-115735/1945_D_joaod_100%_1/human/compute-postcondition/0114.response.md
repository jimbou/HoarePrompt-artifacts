To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will iterate from `na_frente` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is `2`. For the loop to execute again, `v` must be decremented by `1`, so `v` becomes `1`.

The other variables in the loop head are `na_frente`, which is an integer greater than or equal to `0`. Since `v` is decremented by `1` in each iteration, `na_frente` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1**
