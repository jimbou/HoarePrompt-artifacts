Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is the sum of the previous value of `total` and the element at index `v` of either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` depending on which one is smaller, and `best` is the minimum value between the maximum possible float value and the sum of the new value of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by a value less than the value of `custo_pra_passar_b` at index `v` if the cost to change at position `v` is less than the cost to pass at position `v`, otherwise `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, and `best` is the maximum possible float value. `stdin` contains `cases - 1` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.***
