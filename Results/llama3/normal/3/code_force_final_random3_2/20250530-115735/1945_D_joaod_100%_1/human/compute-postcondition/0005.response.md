Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `stdin` contains the remaining input, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `na_frente` was decremented by 1, `pos_final` was decremented by 1, `total` is 0, `best` is the maximum possible float value, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. The current value of `best` is greater than the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`***
