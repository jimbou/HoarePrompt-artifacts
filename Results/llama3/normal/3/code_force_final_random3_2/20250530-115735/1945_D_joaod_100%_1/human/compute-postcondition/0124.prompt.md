Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 2, na_frente is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value by 1, pos_final is an integer less than its original value by 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, total is 0, best is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 3 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`. If `best` is greater than the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, no update is made. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass b at position `v`, and the cost to change a at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass b at position `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by the second element of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `best` is updated if necessary. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the second element of `custo_pra_passar_b` and `best` is updated if necessary. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
