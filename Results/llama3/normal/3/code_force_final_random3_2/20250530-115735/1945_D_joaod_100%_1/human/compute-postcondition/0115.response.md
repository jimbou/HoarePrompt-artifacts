Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` and the second element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a` (since `v` is 1, which is used as an index to access the list). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
