Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`, then `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.***
