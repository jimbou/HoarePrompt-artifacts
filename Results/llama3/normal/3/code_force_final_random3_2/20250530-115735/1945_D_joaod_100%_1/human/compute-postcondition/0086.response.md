Output State: **cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 2, na_frente is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than its original value by 1, pos_final is an integer less than its original value by 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, total is 0, best is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 3 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

The code snippet reads two lines of input from stdin, each containing a space-separated list of integers, and assigns the values to `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It then decrements `na_frente` and `pos_final` by 1. The `total` variable is reset to 0, and the `best` variable is set to the maximum possible float value. The value of `v` remains unchanged at -1. The `cases` and `c` variables are not modified by the code. Stdin now contains `cases - 3` inputs.
