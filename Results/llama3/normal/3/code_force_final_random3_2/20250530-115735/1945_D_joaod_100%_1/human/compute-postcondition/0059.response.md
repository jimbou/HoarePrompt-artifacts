Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`, `best` is the maximum possible float value, `stdin` contains `cases - 1` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers. `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The cost to change at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at position `v`**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the cost to pass at position `v`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `cases - 1` inputs. The conditions that `v` is greater than `pos_final` and the cost to change at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass at position `v` are still valid.
