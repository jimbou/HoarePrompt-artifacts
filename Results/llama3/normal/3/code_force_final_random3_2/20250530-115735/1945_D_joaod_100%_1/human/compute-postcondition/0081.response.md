Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.***
