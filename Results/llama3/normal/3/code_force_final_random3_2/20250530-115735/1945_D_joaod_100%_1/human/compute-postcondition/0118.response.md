Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[1]`, which is the second element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, but its value may have changed due to the increase in `total`.
