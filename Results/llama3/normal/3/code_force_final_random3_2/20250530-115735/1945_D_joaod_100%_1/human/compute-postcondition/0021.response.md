Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `best` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`**

The value of `best` is assigned the sum of `total` and the last element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, since `v` is -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
