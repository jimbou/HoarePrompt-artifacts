Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to a position among the first m people in line. The program iterates through the positions from the end to the front, keeping track of the total cost and the best (minimum) cost found so far. It updates the total cost and best cost based on whether switching to or passing through each position is cheaper. The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the cost to switch to a position is less than the cost to pass through it, and when the cost to pass through a position is less than the cost to switch to it. The program also correctly handles the case when the final position is at the front of the queue.

Correctness: **True**
