Output State: **cases is 0, c is equal to the initial value of cases, na_frente is -1, pos_final is -1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum values between custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b for all positions from na_frente to -1, best is the minimum value between total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and the current best value for all positions from na_frente to -1, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the number of test cases (`cases`) will be 0, the loop counter (`c`) will be equal to the initial number of test cases, `na_frente` and `pos_final` will be -1 (since they are decremented in each iteration), `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` will still be lists of integers, `v` will be -1 (since it is decremented in each iteration), `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs for all positions, and `best` will be the minimum total cost found so far. Additionally, the standard input (`stdin`) will be empty since all test cases will have been processed.
