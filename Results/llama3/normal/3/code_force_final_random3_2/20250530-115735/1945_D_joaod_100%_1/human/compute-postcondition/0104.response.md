The only variable in the loop head is variable  v, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `v`. If `v` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `v` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `v` must be 1.
State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1**
