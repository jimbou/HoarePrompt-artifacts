The code adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. Since `v` is 0, `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is the first element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`. The value of `total` is not specified in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value after the addition. However, we can express the new value of `total` as `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.**
