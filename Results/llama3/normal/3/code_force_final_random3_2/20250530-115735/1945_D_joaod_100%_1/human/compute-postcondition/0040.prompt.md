Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 0, stdin contains the remaining input, na_frente is a positive integer, pos_final is a positive integer, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, na_frente is decremented by 1, pos_final is decremented by 1, total is 0, best is the maximum possible float value
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `na_frente` was decremented by 1, `pos_final` was decremented by 1, `v` is equal to `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if the cost to change at position `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a` is less than the cost to pass at position `v` in `custo_pra_passar_b`, `total` is equal to the previous total plus the cost to change at position `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass at position `v`. If the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, then the best value is updated to be the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change `a` at position `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at position `v`, `total` is equal to the previous value of `total` plus the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` and `best` is updated if necessary. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]` and `best` is updated if necessary. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if the cost to change to A is less than the cost to pass B, `total` is increased by the cost to change to A. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass B.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum value between `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
