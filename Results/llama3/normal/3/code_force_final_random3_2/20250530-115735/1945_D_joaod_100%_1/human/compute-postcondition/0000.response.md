Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code reads an integer from the input using `int(input())` and assigns it to the variable `cases`. Since the input contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of three lines, the value of `cases` will be the number of test cases.

The initial state mentions that stdin contains multiple test cases, but it doesn't specify the exact number of test cases. After reading the value of `cases`, the stdin will still contain the remaining input, which includes the test cases.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining input, which includes the test cases, each consisting of three lines: two space-separated integers n and m, and two lines of n space-separated integers.**
