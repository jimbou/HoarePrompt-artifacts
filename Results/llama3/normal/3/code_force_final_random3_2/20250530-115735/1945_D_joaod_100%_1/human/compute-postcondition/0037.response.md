Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been increased by the last element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`, which is the cost to pass through the last position. The other variables remain unchanged.
