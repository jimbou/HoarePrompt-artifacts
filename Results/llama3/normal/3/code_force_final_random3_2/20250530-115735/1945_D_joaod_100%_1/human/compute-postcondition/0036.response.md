Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`**

The code increments the value of `total` by the last element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is accessed using the index `-1`. The value of `v` is `-1`, which is used to access the last element of the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
