Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, calculates the minimum cost to move from the front to the final position by either switching to or passing through each position, and prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The program initializes the necessary variables, reads the input data, and iterates through the positions from the front to the final position, keeping track of the total cost and the best (minimum) cost found so far. It updates the total cost and best cost based on whether switching to or passing through each position is cheaper.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the final position is at the front of the queue, and when the cost to switch to a position is less than the cost to pass through it.

Overall, the program is well-structured, easy to follow, and correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
