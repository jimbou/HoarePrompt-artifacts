To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `na_frente`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `v` is initialized to `na_frente` and decrements by 1 in each iteration, we can adjust the state of `v` to be equal to `na_frente`.

State: **cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 2, na_frente is an integer greater than or equal to 0, pos_final is an integer less than its original value by 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is na_frente, total is 0, best is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 3 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
