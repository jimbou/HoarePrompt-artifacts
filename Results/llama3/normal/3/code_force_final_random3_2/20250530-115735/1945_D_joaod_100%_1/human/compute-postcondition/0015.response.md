Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is equal to the previous value of `total` plus the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is the maximum possible float value, `v` is equal to `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `total` has been increased by the cost of switching at position `v`, which is less than the cost of passing at position `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
