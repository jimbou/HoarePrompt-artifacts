Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente` and its current value is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is 0, `best` is equal to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `stdin` contains `cases - 1` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be equal to the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `best` is now less than or equal to its previous value, which was the maximum possible float value. The stdin still contains `cases - 1` inputs.
