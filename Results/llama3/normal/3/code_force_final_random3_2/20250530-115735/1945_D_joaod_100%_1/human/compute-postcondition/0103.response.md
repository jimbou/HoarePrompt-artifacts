Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente]`. If `best` is greater than the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the sum of the original value of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, no update is made. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the cost to pass b at position `v`, and the cost to change a at position `v` is greater than or equal to the cost to pass b at position `v`.***
