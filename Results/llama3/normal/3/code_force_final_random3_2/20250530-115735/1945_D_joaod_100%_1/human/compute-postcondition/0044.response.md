Output State: **cases is a positive integer greater than 1, c is 1, na_frente is an integer less than the original value, pos_final is an integer, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, total is 0, best is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 1 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`, then subtracts 1 from both values. It then reads two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. The value of `total` is reset to 0, and the value of `best` is set to the maximum possible float value. The values of `cases`, `c`, and `v` remain unchanged.
