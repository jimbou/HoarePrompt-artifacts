Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is increased by the second element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the second element of `custo_pra_passar_b`. If `best` is greater than the new value of `total` plus the second element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, then `best` is updated to the new value of `total` plus the second element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.***
