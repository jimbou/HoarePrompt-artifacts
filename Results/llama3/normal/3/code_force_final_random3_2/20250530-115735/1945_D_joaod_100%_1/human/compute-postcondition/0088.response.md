Postcondition: **cases is a positive integer greater than 0, c is 2, na_frente is an integer greater than or equal to 0, pos_final is an integer less than its original value by 1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is na_frente, total is 0, best is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 3 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of v is less than or equal to pos_final.**
