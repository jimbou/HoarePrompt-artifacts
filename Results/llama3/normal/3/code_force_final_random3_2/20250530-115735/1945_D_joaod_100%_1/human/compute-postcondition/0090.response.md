Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, `best` is the sum of `total` and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`, stdin contains `cases - 3` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` has been updated to be the sum of `total` (which is 0) and the element at index `v` in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `cases - 3` inputs. The relationship between `v` and `pos_final` is still valid.
