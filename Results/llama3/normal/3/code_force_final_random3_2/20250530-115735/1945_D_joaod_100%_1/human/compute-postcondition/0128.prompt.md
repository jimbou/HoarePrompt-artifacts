You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200000). The second and third lines contain n space-separated integers (1 <= integer <= 10^9).
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = sys.float_info.max
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: cases is 0, c is equal to the initial value of cases, na_frente is -1, pos_final is -1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum values between custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b for all positions from na_frente to -1, best is the minimum value between total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and the current best value for all positions from na_frente to -1, and stdin is empty.

```

Return Postconditions: cases is 0, c is equal to the initial value of cases, na_frente is -1, pos_final is -1, custo_pra_trocar_a is a list of integers, custo_pra_passar_b is a list of integers, v is -1, total is the sum of the minimum values between custo_pra_trocar_a and custo_pra_passar_b for all positions from na_frente to -1, best is the minimum value between total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v] and the current best value for all positions from na_frente to -1, and stdin is empty.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
