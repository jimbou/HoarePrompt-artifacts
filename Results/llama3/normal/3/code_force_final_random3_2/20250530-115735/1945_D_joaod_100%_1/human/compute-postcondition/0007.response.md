Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `na_frente` was decremented by 1, `pos_final` was decremented by 1, `total` is 0, `v` is equal to `na_frente` and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If the current best value is greater than the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`, then the best value is updated to be the total cost plus the cost to change at position `v`.***
