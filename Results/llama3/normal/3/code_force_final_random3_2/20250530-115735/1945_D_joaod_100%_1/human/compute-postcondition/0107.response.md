Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 1, `total` is increased by the second element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`. If `best` is greater than the updated `total`, then `best` is updated to the updated `total`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the second element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is the value at index 1 of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, so if `best` is greater than the updated `total`, it will be updated to the updated `total`.
