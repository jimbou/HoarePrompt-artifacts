Postcondition: ***`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is increased by the minimum value between `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.***
