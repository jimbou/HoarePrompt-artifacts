stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m, where 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n separated by spaces, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9.
