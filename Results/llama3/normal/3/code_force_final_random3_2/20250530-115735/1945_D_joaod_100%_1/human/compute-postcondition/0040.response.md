Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is 0, `pos_final` is 0, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1. `total` is the sum of the minimum values between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for all positions from `na_frente` to -1. `best` is the minimum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and the current `best` value for all positions from `na_frente` to -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `na_frente` and `pos_final` have been decremented to 0, and `v` has reached -1. The `total` variable now holds the sum of the minimum values between the costs to change to A and the costs to pass B for all positions from the initial value of `na_frente` to -1. The `best` variable has been updated to be the minimum value between the total cost plus the cost to change to A at each position and the current best value for all positions from the initial value of `na_frente` to -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
