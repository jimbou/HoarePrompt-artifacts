This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines. It calculates the minimum cost to move from the front to the final position by either switching to or passing through each position, and prints the minimum cost for each test case. The function iterates through the positions from the front to the final position, keeping track of the total cost and the best (minimum) cost found so far. It updates the total cost and best cost based on whether switching to or passing through each position is cheaper. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and returns no value.
