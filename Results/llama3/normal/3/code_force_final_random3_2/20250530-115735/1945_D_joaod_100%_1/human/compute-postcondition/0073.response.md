Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `best` is calculated by adding the value of `total` to the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, since `v` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
