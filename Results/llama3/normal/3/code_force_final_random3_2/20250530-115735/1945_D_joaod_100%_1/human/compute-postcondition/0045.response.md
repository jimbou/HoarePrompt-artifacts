To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `na_frente`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, since the range starts from `na_frente` and goes down to -1.

State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente`, `total` is 0, `best` is the maximum possible float value, `stdin` contains `cases - 1` inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
