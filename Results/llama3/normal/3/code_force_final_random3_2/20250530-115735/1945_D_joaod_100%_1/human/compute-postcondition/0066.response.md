Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the last element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, and if it is true, `best` will be updated to the new value of `total` plus the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`.
