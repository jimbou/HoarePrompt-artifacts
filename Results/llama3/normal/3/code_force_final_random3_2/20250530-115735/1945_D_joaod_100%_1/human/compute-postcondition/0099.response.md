Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 2, `na_frente` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is an integer less than its original value by 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is `na_frente` and is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente]`, `best` is the maximum possible float value, stdin contains cases - 4 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated to be the cost to change to option A at position `v`, which is `na_frente`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `cases - 3` inputs, which are two space-separated lists of integers.
