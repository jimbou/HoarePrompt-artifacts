Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been increased by the first element of the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, if the value of `best` is greater than the new value of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to be equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.
