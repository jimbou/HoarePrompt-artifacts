Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a positive integer, `pos_final` is a positive integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`**

In this output state, the value of `best` is calculated by adding `total` to the last element of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, which is accessed using the index `v` that is equal to -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
