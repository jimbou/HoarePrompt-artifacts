Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to not wait too long. It iterates over the positions from the end of the queue to the beginning, keeping track of the total cost and the best position found so far. The program correctly handles the cases where the cost to swap positions is less than the cost to pass through a position, and it updates the total cost and the best position accordingly. The program also correctly handles the case where the final position is 0, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description but is implied by the example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
