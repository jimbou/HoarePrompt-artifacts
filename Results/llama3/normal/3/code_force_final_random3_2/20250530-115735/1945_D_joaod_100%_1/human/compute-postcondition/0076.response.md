Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an integer greater than 0, `pos_final` is an integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `v` is 0, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.**

In this output state, the value of `total` has been updated by adding the first element of the list `custo_pra_passar_b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `best` is still valid, but its value may have changed if the condition is met.
