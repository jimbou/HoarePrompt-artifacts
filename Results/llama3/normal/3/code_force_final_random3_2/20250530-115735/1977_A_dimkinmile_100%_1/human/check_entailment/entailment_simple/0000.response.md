Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program reads the number of test cases (kreker) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

The program then checks the condition ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) to determine whether it's possible to build the tower. This condition is based on the fact that the difference between the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m) must be even and non-negative.

If the condition is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build the tower. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the problem's constraints. The condition ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) ensures that the difference between n and m is even and non-negative, which is a necessary condition for building the tower.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
