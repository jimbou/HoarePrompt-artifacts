Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

2. The given program defines a function func_1() that takes two integers n and m as input, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. The function checks if the difference between n and m (n - m) is even and non-negative. This is because if the difference is even, it means that Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs, resulting in the desired number of cubes in the tower.

4. If the condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0 is true, the function prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

5. If the condition is false, the function prints 'No', indicating that it's not possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

6. The main part of the program reads the number of test cases (kreker) and calls the func_1() function for each test case.

7. However, there is a logical error in the program. The condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0 is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. This is because the condition only checks if the difference between n and m is even, but it doesn't consider the case where n is less than m.

8. For example, if n = 3 and m = 5, the condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0 is false, but it's still possible to have a tower with exactly 5 cubes after 3 moves (by adding 5 cubes and then removing 2 cubes).

9. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
