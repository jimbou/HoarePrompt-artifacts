Based on the initial state, the code will print 'No' because the condition ((n - m) % 2 != 0 or n - m < 0) is always true for the given range of n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). This is because the difference between any two numbers in this range will always be even or negative, making the condition true.

Output: **No**
