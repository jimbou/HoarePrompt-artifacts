Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it is possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0 checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves.

The program works by iterating over each test case and checking the condition. If the condition is true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when n and m are equal, when n is greater than m, and when n is less than m.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
