Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program correctly reads the number of test cases (kreker) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

The program then checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative. This is a correct condition to check because:

* If the difference is even, it means that the number of cubes added and removed can be paired up, resulting in a net change of 0 or a multiple of 2.
* If the difference is non-negative, it means that the number of cubes added is greater than or equal to the number of cubes removed, which is a necessary condition to build a tower with m cubes.

If the condition is true, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
