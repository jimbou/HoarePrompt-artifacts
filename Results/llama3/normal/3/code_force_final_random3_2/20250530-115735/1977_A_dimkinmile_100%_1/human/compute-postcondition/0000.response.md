Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100), where t is an integer between 1 and 100.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be the first two integers from the input, which are between 1 and 100. The stdin still contains t-1 lines, each with two integers, as the first line has been consumed by the input operation. The value of t is still between 1 and 100, as it was not affected by the code.
