Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative.

However, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0 is not sufficient to determine whether it is possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

For example, consider the case where n = 5 and m = 3. The program will print 'Yes' because (5 - 3) % 2 == 0 and 5 - 3 >= 0. However, it is not possible to have a tower with exactly 3 cubes after 5 moves, because the maximum number of cubes that can be added or removed in 5 moves is 5, and it is not possible to have a tower with 3 cubes after 5 moves.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
