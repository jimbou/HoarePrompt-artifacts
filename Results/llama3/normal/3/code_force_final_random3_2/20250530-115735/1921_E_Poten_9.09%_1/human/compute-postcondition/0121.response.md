The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is at least 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again test_cases must be greater than 2.
State: **`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains two strings: the original string and 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` contains two strings. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains the initial string and 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains two strings. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains the original string and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' depending on the condition `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state. Otherwise, no output has been returned. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state and `answers` is a list containing two strings. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been appended to the list of answers. Otherwise, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 2` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
