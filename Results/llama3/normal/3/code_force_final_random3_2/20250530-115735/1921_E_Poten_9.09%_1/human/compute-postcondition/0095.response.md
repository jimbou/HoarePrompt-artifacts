The code `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string 'Bob' to the end of the list `answers`. The initial state of `answers` is a list containing a string, so after the code is executed, `answers` will be a list containing two strings. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**
