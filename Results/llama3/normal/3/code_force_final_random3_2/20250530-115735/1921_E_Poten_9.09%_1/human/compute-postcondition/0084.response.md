Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending the string 'Draw' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, since one test case has been processed. The list `clues` remains the same, containing integers from the input.
