Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The current value of the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is at least 1, the variable `i` is still 0, the list `answers` now contains the string 'Alice', the list `clues` remains unchanged, and the standard input contains one less test case. The conditions on the elements of `clues` are still satisfied, and the third element of `clues` is still equal to the fifth element of `clues`.
