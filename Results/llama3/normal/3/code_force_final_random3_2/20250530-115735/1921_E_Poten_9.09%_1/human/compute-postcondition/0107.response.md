Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state and `answers` is a list containing two strings. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Alice'.***
