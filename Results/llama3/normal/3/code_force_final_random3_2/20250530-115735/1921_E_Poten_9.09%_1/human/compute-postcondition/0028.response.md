Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. The current value of the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues`, or the current value of the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'Draw', while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
