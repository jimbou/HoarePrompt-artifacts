Postcondition: **`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then `answers` is a list containing two strings: the original string and 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Draw' if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains two strings. Otherwise, `answers` contains two strings: the initial string and 'Bob'.**
