Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. Neither `clues[3] - 1` nor `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` divided by 2***
