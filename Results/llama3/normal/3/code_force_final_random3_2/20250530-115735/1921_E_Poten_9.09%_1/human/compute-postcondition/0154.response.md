Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw' as its second element, in addition to the string it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, since one test case has been processed.
