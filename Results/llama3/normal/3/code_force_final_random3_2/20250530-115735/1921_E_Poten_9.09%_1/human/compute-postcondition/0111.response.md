Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been appended to the list of answers. Otherwise, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers.***
