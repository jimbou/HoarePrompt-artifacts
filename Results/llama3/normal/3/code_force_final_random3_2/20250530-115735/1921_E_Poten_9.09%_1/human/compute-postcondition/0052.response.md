Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. If the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
