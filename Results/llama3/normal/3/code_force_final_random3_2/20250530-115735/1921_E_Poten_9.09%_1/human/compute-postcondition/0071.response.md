Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. The difference between the fifth element of `clues` minus 2 and the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` divided by 2 is less than or equal to the difference between the fourth element of `clues` minus the fifth element of `clues` minus 1 and the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` divided by 2***
