Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `answers` remain unchanged. Since one test case has been read from the input, the number of test cases in the stdin is reduced by 1.
