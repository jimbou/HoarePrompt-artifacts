Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. The current value of `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, or the current value of `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is at least 1, the counter `i` is still 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw', the list of clues remains the same, and the standard input contains one less test case. The conditions on the elements of the `clues` list are still satisfied.
