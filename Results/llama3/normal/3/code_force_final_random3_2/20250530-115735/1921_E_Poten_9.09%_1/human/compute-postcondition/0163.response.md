Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, `answers` is a list containing `test_cases` strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains no test cases.**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The value of `test_cases` has been decremented to 0, and the value of `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`. The `answers` list now contains `test_cases` strings, each of which is either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', depending on the conditions evaluated in the loop body. The `clues` list contains the last set of integers read from the input. The stdin now contains no test cases, as all test cases have been read and processed by the loop.
