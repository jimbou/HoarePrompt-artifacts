Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The program's state does not change based on the condition, as both the if and else parts have the same postcondition.***
