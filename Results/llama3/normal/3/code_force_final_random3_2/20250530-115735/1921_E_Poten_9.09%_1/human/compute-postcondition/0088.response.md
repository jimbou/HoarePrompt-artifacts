Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Bob' in addition to the existing string it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before since one test case has been processed.
