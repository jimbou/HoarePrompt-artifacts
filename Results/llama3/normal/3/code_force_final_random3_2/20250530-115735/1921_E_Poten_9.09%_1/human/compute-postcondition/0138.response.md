Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains two strings. Otherwise, `answers` still contains two strings.***
