This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of six integers representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of two chips, Alice's and Bob's. It then determines the winner of a game based on the positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board, and appends the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results in the order they were received. The function does not modify the input or have any side effects beyond printing the results.
