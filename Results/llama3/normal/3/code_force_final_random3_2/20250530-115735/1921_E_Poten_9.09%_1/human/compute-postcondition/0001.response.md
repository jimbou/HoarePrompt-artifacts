To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases**
