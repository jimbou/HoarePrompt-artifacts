Postcondition: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input. If `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains two strings. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, the second string in `answers` is 'Draw' if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise the second string in `answers` is 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains the initial string and 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains two strings. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains the original string and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' depending on the condition `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state. Otherwise, no output has been returned.**
