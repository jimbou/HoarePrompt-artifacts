Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The code appends the string 'Bob' to the list `answers`. The initial state of `answers` is a list containing a string, so after appending 'Bob', it becomes a list containing two strings. The values of the other variables, `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues`, are not affected by this code. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1.
