Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the first string is the same as before, and the second string is 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending the string 'Bob' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, since one test case has been processed.
