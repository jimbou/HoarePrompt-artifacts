Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Bob'.***
