Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4, answers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line that was read to determine the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1:
                if clues[3] - 1 >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[5
                    ] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:

The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]`, or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the conditions: if the third and fifth elements of `clues` have the same parity and are equal, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If they have the same parity but are not equal, then if the absolute difference between them is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between them is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues`. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the sixth element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third and fifth elements of `clues` have different parity, then if they are equal, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If they are not equal, then if the absolute difference between them is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the current value of `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, or the current value of `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains two strings: the original string and 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` contains two strings. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains the initial string and 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains two strings. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains the original string and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' depending on the condition `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state. Otherwise, no output has been returned. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state and `answers` is a list containing two strings. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been appended to the list of answers. Otherwise, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 2` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the original string and 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Draw' if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains two strings. Otherwise, `answers` contains two strings: the initial string and 'Bob'. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, the second string in `answers` is 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, the second string in `answers` is added if `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise it is 'Alice'. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, then if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, the state of the program remains the same, otherwise it remains the same. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw' if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise the program's state does not change.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
