Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, 'Draw' has been appended to the list of answers.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending the string 'Draw' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
