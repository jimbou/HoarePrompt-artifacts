Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending the string 'Bob' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before, since one test case has been processed.
