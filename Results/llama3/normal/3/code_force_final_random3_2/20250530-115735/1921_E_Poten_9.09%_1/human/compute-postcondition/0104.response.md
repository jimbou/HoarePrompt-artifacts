Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Alice'.***
