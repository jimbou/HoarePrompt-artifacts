Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings. ***
