Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. If the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the sixth element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
