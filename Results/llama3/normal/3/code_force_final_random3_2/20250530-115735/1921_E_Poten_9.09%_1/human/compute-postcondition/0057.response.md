Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. The difference between the second and fifth elements of `clues` minus 1 is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, and the difference between the fifth and third elements of `clues` minus 1 is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is at least 1, the counter `i` is still 0, and the list `answers` now contains the string 'Alice'. The list `clues` remains unchanged, and the standard input still contains multiple test cases minus 1. All the conditions related to the elements of `clues` remain the same.
