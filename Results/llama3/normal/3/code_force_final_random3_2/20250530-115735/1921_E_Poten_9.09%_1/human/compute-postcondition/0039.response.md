Postcondition: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues`, or the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues`, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2 or the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then the program does not modify `answers`.**
