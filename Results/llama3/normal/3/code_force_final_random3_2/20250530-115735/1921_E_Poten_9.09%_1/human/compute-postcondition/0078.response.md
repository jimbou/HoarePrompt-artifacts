Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is either greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the sixth element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have different parity (one is even and the other is odd), then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the current value of `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, or the current value of `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
