Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. The difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, and the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is at least 1, the counter `i` is still 0, and the list of answers now contains the string 'Bob'. The list of clues remains unchanged, and the conditions on the elements of the clues list are still satisfied. The standard input still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before.
