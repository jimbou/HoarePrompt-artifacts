Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state and `answers` is a list containing two strings. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been appended to the list of answers. Otherwise, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 2` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.***
