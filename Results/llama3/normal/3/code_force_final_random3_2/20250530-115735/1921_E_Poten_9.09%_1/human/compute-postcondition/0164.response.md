The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `answers`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answers`. If `answers` has at least 1 string the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 string and the `j` is the first string in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, `answers` is a list containing at least 1 string, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains no test cases, `j` is the first string in the list**
