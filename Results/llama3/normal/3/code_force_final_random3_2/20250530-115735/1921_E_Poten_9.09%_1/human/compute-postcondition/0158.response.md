Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw' if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, the program's state does not change.***
