Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is less than the absolute half of the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, and the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than the absolute half of the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`***
