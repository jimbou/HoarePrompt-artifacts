Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'Bob', while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
