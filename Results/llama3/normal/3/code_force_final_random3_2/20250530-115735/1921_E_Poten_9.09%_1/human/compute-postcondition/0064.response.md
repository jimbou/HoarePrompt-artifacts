Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. The current value of `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the current value of `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is at least 1, the index `i` is still 0, and the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'. The list of clues remains the same, with the third element being less than or equal to the fifth element, and the first element not being 1. The third and fifth elements of clues have different parity (one is even and the other is odd), and they are not equal. The third element is greater than the fifth element, and their absolute difference is greater than 1. Additionally, either the value of the fifth element minus 1 or the difference between the third and fifth elements is greater than half of the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements.
