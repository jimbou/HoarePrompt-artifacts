Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the original string and 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Draw' if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` contains two strings. Otherwise, `answers` contains two strings: the initial string and 'Bob'. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, the second string in `answers` is 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, the second string in `answers` is added if `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, otherwise it is 'Alice'. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, then if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, the state of the program remains the same, otherwise it remains the same. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw' if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, otherwise the program's state does not change.***
