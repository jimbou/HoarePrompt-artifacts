Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The code reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the `clues` variable. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains one less test case.
