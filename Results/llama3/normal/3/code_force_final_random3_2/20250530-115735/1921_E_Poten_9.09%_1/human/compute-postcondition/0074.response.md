Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, then if the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the difference between the fifth element of `clues` minus 2 and the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` divided by 2 is greater than the difference between the fourth element of `clues` minus the fifth element of `clues` minus 1 and the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
