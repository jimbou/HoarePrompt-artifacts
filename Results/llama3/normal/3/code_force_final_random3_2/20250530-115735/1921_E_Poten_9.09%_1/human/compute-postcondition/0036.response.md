Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` or the difference between the third element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is at least 1, the counter `i` is still 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Bob', and the list of clues remains unchanged. The conditions on the elements of the clues list are still satisfied, and the standard input contains one less test case.
