Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The initial state of `answers` was a list containing a string, so now it contains two strings. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `test_cases` is still at least 3, `i` is still 2, and `clues` is still a list of integers that was read from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1.
