Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board. The program handles all possible cases, including when Alice or Bob wins, or when the game ends in a draw. The program also correctly handles the case when the chips are in the same column or row, and when the chips are in different columns or rows. The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **True**
