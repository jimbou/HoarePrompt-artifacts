Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, 'Draw' has been returned at the output state.**

In natural language, the output state means that the number of test cases is still at least 2, and the value of `i` remains 1. The list `answers` now contains two strings, with the string 'Draw' appended to it. The list `clues` still contains integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before. Additionally, the string 'Draw' has been returned at the output state.
