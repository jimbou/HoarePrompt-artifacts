Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column but on different rows, and the difference between their rows is greater than 1. In this case, the program does not correctly determine the winner.

For example, consider the input:

10 10 2 5 8 5

In this case, Alice is on row 2 and Bob is on row 8, and they are in the same column. The program should determine that Alice wins, but it does not correctly handle this case.

The program also does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same row but on different columns, and the difference between their columns is greater than 1. In this case, the program does not correctly determine the winner.

For example, consider the input:

10 10 5 2 5 8

In this case, Alice is on column 2 and Bob is on column 8, and they are in the same row. The program should determine that Alice wins, but it does not correctly handle this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
