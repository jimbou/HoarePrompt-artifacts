Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If the difference between clues[1] and clues[3] is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, or the difference between clues[3] and clues[5] is greater than the absolute difference between clues[2] and clues[4] divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state. Otherwise, no output has been returned.***
