The only variables in the loop head are variables  `i` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
State: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]`, or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' based on the conditions: if the third and fifth elements of `clues` have the same parity and are equal, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If they have the same parity but are not equal, then if the absolute difference between them is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between them is greater than or equal to half of the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues`. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the sixth element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the second and fourth elements of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third and fifth elements of `clues` have different parity, then if they are equal, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If they are not equal, then if the absolute difference between them is greater than 1, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the current value of `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, or the current value of `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.**
