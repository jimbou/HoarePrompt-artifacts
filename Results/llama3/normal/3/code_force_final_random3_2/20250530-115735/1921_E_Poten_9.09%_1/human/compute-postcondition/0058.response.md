Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` is less than or equal to 1. If the current value of `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, or the current value of `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, then `answers` contains the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Alice'.***
