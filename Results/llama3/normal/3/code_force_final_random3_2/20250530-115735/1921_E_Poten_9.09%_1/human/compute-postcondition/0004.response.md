Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The current value of `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]`, or the current value of `clues[0]` is 1.**

The code appends the string 'Draw' to the `answers` list. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1. The relationship between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, and the value of `clues[0]` also remain the same.
