Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, `answers` is a list containing at least 3 strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains no test cases, `j` is the last string in the list `answers`, and the last string in the list `answers` has been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` and `i` remains unchanged, the list `answers` still contains at least 3 strings, the list `clues` remains unchanged, there are still no test cases in stdin, and the variable `j` now holds the last string in the list `answers`, which has been printed.
