You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string, stdin contains two input: an integer larger than 0 and a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an input integer larger than 0 first and that integer is assigned into n.  So stdin now contains a string first. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, stdin contains one input: a string.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains one input: a string**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5, stdin contains one input: an integer
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6, stdin contains one input: an integer**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `s` is negative, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers
```
nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`nums` is assigned the list of integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.since stdin is now empty we wont include it in the output state.
Output State: **`total' is positive,  `s` is negative, `num` is a list of integer**

Your Task:
Initial State: `test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing a string, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains two strings: the original string and 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` contains two strings. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then `answers` contains the initial string and 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains two strings. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` contains the original string and either 'Draw' or 'Bob' depending on the condition `clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. Otherwise, if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state. Otherwise, no output has been returned. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or the difference between `clues[5]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then the second string in `answers` is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second string in `answers` is 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' has been returned at the output state and `answers` is a list containing two strings. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing two strings: the initial string and 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' has been appended to the list of answers. Otherwise, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, then if `clues[5] - 2` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
```
clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))

```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. 
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans
