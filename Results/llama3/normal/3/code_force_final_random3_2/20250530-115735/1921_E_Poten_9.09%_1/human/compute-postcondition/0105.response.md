Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, 'Draw' has been returned at the output state.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw' in addition to the existing string it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged, with `test_cases` still being at least 2, `i` still being 1, and `clues` still being a list of integers. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before since one test case has been processed. Also, 'Draw' has been returned at the output state.
