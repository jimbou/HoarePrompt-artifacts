Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The state of the variables remains the same regardless of the conditions. The difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` and the difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` are compared to the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, but this comparison does not affect the state of the variables.***
