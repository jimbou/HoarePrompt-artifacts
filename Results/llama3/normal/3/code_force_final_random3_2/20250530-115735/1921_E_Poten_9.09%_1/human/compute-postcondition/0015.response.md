Output State: **`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Bob', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1. Neither `clues[3] - 1` nor `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between the third and fifth elements of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is at least 1, the counter `i` is still 0, and the list of answers now contains the string 'Bob'. The list of clues remains unchanged, with the first element not being 1, the third and fifth elements having the same parity, and the third element being less than the fifth element. The absolute difference between the third and fifth elements is greater than 1, and neither `clues[3] - 1` nor `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to half of this absolute difference. The standard input still contains multiple test cases, but one less than before.
