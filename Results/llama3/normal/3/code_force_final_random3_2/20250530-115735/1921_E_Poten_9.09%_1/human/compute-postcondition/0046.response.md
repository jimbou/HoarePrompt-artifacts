Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`***
