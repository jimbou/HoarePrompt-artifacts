Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Alice' or 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues` and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. Either the third element of `clues` is even and the fifth element of `clues` is odd, or the third element of `clues` is odd and the fifth element of `clues` is even. If the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than 1, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, or the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and the third element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to 1, then if the current value of `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, or the current value of `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between the third and fourth elements of `clues` by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
