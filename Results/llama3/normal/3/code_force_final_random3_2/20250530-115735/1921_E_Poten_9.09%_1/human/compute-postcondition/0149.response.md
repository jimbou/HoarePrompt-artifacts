Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `clues` is a list of integers that was read from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. If `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then the state of the program remains the same. Otherwise, the state of the program remains the same.***
