Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 3 elements. `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka` if `i` was not in `pl` before, otherwise `pl` is an empty list. `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the third element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is incremented by 1. `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. `i` is the third element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1, meaning that the count of the third element in the list `palka` in the dictionary `d` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
