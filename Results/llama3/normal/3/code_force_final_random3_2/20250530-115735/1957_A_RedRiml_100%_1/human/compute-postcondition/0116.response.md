Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1-100) followed by a list of n positive integers (1-100). It then processes each test case by counting the occurrences of each integer, identifies unique integers, and calculates the total count of integers that appear at least three times, divided by 3. The function prints the calculated total count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and modifies the input variables accordingly.**
