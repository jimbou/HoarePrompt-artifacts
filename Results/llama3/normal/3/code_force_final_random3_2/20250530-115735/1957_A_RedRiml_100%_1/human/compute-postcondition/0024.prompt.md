Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, ln is a positive integer and less or equal than 100, palka is a list of ln integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer and less or equal than 100. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 100, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 1 element, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the first element of `palka` if it was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the first element of `palka`, the current value of `_` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the first element of `palka` and if the second element of `palka` was not already in `pl`, it is added to `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the second element of `palka`, the current value of `_` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the first three elements of `palka` if the third element of `palka` was not already in `pl`, otherwise it contains the first two elements of `palka` and the third element of `palka` is not added to `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is the third element of `palka`, the current value of `_` is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
