Output State: **w is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 2, ln is 0, palka is an empty list, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is not defined, j is not defined, _ is 2, shapes is not defined**

The code snippet reads two lines from the standard input: the first line contains a single integer that is assigned to `ln`, and the second line contains a list of integers that is assigned to `palka`. The list `pl` and the dictionary `d` are initialized as empty. The value of `ln` is updated to 0, and the list `palka` is updated to contain the integers from the second line of the input. The list `pl` and the dictionary `d` remain empty. The variable `i` is no longer defined, and the variable `j` is no longer defined. The variable `_` remains 2. The variable `shapes` is not defined. The number of test cases in the standard input is reduced by 2.
