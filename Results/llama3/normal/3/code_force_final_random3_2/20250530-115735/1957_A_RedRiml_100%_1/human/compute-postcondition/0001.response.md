The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer and less or equal than 100. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 100. So for the loop to be executed  `w` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer and less or equal than 100. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 100, `_` is 0**
