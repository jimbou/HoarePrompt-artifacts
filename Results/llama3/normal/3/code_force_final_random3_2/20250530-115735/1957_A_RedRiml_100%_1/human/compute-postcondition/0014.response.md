Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the first element of `palka` if it was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the second element of `palka`, the current value of `_` is 0.**

The code increments the value of `d[i]` by 1, where `i` is the first element of `palka`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The dictionary `d` now contains the updated value for the key `i`.
