Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `shapes` is now explicitly set to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
