Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`, `shapes` is increased by the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated by adding the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3. The count of `j` is obtained from the dictionary `d`, where `j` is the second element in the list `pl`. The other variables remain unchanged.
