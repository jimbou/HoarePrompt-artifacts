#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer and less or equal than 100. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 100.
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than or equal to 0, `ln` is 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `_` is `w-1`, `shapes` is increased by the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3 if the count of `j` in the original `palka` list is 3 or more, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged, and the value of `shapes` is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1-100) followed by a list of n positive integers (1-100). It then processes each test case by counting the occurrences of each integer, identifies unique integers, and calculates the total count of integers that appear at least three times, divided by 3. The function prints the calculated total count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and modifies the input variables accordingly.
