Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the first three elements of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is the third element of `palka`, the current value of `_` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` and `ln` remains the same as they were not affected by the code. The list `palka` also remains the same. The list `pl` now contains the first three elements of `palka`. The dictionary `d` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same. The value of `i` is still the third element of `palka`. The value of `_` is still 0.
