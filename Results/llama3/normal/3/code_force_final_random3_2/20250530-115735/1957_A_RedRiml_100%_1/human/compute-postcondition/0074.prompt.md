Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list that contains at least 3 occurrences of the value `j`, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the first element in the list `pl` and has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1, and if `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, `shapes` is equal to the number of times `j` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list that contains at least 3 occurrences of the value `j`, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the second element in the list `pl` and has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1. If `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, `shapes` is equal to the number of times `j` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list that contains at least 3 occurrences of the value `j`, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the third element in the list `pl` and has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1. If `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, `shapes` is equal to the number of times `j` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
