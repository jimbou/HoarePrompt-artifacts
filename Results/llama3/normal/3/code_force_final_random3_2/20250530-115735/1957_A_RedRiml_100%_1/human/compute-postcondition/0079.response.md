To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `palka`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `palka` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 2, `ln` is 0, `palka` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, `j` is not defined, `_` is 2, `shapes` is not defined**
