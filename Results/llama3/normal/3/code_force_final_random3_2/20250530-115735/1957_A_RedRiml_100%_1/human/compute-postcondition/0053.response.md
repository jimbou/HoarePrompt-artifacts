Postcondition: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list of integers and the first element in the list `palka` is appended to it if it was not previously in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, otherwise `d[i]` is one more than its previous value, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the second element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl` and is now the second last element in the list `pl` if `i` was appended, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is unchanged. If `i` was not previously in `d`, then `d[i]` is now 1. If `i` was previously in `d`, then `d[i]` is now 2.**
