Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list and must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, if the count of `j` in the original `palka` list is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged. `j` is the first element in the list `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`. If the count of `j` in the original `palka` list is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, `j` is the third element in the list `pl`. If the count of `j` in the original `palka` list is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
