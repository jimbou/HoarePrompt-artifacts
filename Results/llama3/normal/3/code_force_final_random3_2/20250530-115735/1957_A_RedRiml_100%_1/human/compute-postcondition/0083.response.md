Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 2, `ln` is 0, `palka` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` is defined and its value is incremented by 1, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, `j` is not defined, `_` is 2, `shapes` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
