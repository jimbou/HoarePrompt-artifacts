The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list palka, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the palka.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, palka has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the first two elements of `palka` and if the third element of `palka` was not already in `pl`, it is added to `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is the third element of `palka`, the current value of `_` is 0**
