Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the first element of `palka`, `_` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `stdin`, `i`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the dictionary `d`, where the value associated with the key `i` (which is the first element of `palka`) is incremented by 1.
