Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

4
6
2 2 3 3 3 3

The program outputs 1, but the correct output should be 2. The program only checks for triangles (3 sides) and does not consider other regular polygons with more sides.

The program should also consider the case where the number of sticks of the same length is not a multiple of 3, but can still form a regular polygon with more sides. For example, 5 sticks of the same length can form a pentagon.

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible regular polygon sides (from 3 to the maximum number of sticks of the same length) and check if the number of sticks of that length can form a polygon with that number of sides.
