Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `palka` is now an empty list because the loop has iterated over all its elements, `pl` contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list, and `d` contains the count of each element in the original `palka` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
