Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer and less or equal than 100. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 100.**

In this output state, the value of `w` is assigned the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer and less or equal than 100. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin, with each test case containing two inputs: an integer n and a list of n integers. The values of n and the integers in the list are still positive integers and less or equal than 100.
