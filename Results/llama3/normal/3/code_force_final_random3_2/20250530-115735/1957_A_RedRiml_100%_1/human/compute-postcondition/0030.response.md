The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list pl, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list pl.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, pl has at least 1 element, j is the first element in the list pl. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the j is the second element in the list.
State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list and must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, if the count of `j` in the original `palka` list is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged. `j` is the second element in the list `pl`.**
