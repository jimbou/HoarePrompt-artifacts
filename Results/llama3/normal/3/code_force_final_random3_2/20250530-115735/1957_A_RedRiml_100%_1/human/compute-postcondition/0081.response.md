Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 1 element. `pl` is an empty list. `d` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and the value is 1. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined.**

In this output state, the only change is that the dictionary `d` now has a single key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) and the value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
