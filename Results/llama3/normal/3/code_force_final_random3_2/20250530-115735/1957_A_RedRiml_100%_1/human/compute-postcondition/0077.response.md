The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `w`. If `_` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` must be 2 and `w` must be greater than 2.
State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 2, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list that contains at least 3 occurrences of the value `j`, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(pl)` elements and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl` and has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, the current value of `_` is 2. If `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, `shapes` is equal to the sum of the number of times each element in `pl` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0, and the number of shapes is printed, where the number of shapes is the sum of the number of times each element in `pl` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, since `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`**
