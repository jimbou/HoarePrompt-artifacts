The code prints the total number of shapes formed by the elements in the list `pl`, where each shape is formed by a group of 3 or more elements of the same type. The number of shapes for each element is calculated by dividing its frequency in the list `palka` by 3 and rounding down to the nearest integer, and then summing up these values for all elements in `pl`.

Output: **the total number of shapes formed by the elements in the list pl**
