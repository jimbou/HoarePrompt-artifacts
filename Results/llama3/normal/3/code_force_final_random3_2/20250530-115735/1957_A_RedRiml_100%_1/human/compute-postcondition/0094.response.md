To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `palka`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `palka` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `palka` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element in the list `palka`.

State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 3 elements. `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka` if `i` was not in `pl` before, otherwise `pl` is an empty list. `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the third element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is 1 if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, otherwise its value is incremented by 1. `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. `i` is the third element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the third element of `palka`.**
