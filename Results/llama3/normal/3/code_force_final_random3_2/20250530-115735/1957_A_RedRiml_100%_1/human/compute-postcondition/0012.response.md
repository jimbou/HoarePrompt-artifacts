To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in palka:`. This means that the loop will iterate over the elements of the list `palka`. Since `palka` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute again.

To adjust the state, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `palka`.

* `i` is currently the first element of `palka`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be the next element in `palka`.
* `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `palka` should have at least 2 elements.

The other variables in the state (`w`, `ln`, `pl`, `d`, `stdin`, and `_`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the first element of `palka` if it was not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the second element of `palka`, the current value of `_` is 0.**
