Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, `shapes` is 0.**

The code only introduces a new variable `shapes` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the new variable `shapes` with its assigned value, and all the other variables from the initial state with their original values and properties.
