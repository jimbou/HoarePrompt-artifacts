Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the first element of `palka`, `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `stdin`, `i`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the dictionary `d` now has `i` as a key with a value of 1.
