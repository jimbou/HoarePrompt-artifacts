Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is an empty list. `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`. `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the frequency of that element in `palka`. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. `i` is the last element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The loop iterates over all elements in the list `palka`. For each element, it increments its frequency in the dictionary `d` and adds it to the list `pl` if it's not already there. After the loop finishes, `palka` is empty, `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka`, and `d` contains the frequency of each element in `palka`. The other variables remain unchanged.
