Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list that contains at least 3 occurrences of the value `j`, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(pl)` elements and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl` and has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1. If `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, `shapes` is equal to the sum of the number of times each element in `pl` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in the list `pl`. The value of `j` is now the last element in `pl`, and the value of `shapes` is the sum of the number of times each element in `pl` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, if each element has appeared at least 3 times. If any element has appeared less than 3 times, `shapes` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
