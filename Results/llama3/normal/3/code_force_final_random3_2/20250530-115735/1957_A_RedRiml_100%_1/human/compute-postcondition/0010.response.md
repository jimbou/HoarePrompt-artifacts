Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 1 element, `pl` is a list of integers that contains the first element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` (the first element of `palka`) and the value of `d[i]` is either 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or increased by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the first element of `palka`, the current value of `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`, `stdin`, `i`, and `_` remains the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the list `pl` now contains the first element of `palka`, which is `i`.
