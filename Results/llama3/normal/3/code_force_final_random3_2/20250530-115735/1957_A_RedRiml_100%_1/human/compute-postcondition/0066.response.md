Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list that contains at least 3 occurrences of the value `j`, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the first element in the list `pl` and has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is equal to the number of times `j` appeared in `palka` divided by 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, `stdin`, `i`, `j`, and `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `shapes`, which is now equal to the number of times `j` appeared in `palka` divided by 3.
