To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `palka`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of each element in `palka` during each iteration.

State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `shapes` is unchanged**
