Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2, `ln` is 0, `palka` is a list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the frequency of that element in `palka`, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is the last element in the list `palka`, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3 if the frequency of `j` in `palka` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `shapes` has been updated. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is 3 or more, `shapes` has been increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged.
