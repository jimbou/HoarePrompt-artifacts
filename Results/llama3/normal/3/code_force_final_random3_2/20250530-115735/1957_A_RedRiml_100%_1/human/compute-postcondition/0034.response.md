Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list and must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, `j` is the third element in the list `pl`, `shapes` is increased by the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3 if the count of `j` in the original `palka` list is 3 or more, otherwise `shapes` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `shapes` has been updated based on the count of `j` in the original `palka` list. If the count of `j` is 3 or more, `shapes` has been increased by the count of `j` divided by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains the same. All other variables remain unchanged.
