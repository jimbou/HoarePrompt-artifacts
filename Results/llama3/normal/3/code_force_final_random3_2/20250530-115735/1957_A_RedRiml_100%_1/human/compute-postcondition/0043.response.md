Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1 and `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `shapes` is unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been updated to 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains a key-value pair where the key is the first element of `palka` and the value is 1.
