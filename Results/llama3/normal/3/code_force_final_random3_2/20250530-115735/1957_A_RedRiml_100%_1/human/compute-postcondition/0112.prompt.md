Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is an empty list. `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`. `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the frequency of that element in `palka`. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. `i` is the last element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2, `ln` is 0, `palka` is a list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the frequency of that element in `palka`, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is the last element in the list `palka`, `j` is the first element in the list `pl`, `_` is 2, if the frequency of `j` in `palka` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2, `ln` is 0, `palka` is a list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 2 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the frequency of that element in `palka`, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is the last element in the list `palka`, `j` is the second element in the list `pl`, `_` is 2. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2, `ln` is 0, `palka` is a list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` that must have at least 3 elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the frequency of that element in `palka`, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is the last element in the list `palka`, `j` is the third element in the list `pl`, `_` is 2. If the frequency of `j` in `palka` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of `j` by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
