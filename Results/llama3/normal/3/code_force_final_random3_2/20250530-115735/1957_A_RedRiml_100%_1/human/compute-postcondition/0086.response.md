Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 1 element. `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`. `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is 1 if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, otherwise its value is incremented by 1. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains unchanged, it is still a positive integer less than or equal to 100 and greater than 2. The value of `ln` is still 0. The list `palka` still has at least 1 element. The list `pl` now contains the first element of `palka`. The dictionary `d` still has the key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) with a value of 1 if it was initially `None`, otherwise its value is incremented by 1. The `stdin` still contains t-2 test cases. The value of `i` is still the first element in the list `palka`. The variable `j` is still not defined. The value of `_` is still 2. The variable `shapes` is still not defined.
