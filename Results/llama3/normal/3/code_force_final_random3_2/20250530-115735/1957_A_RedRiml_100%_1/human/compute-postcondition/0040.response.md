In this output state, the value of `ln` has been updated to a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, which is the integer value of the input. The value of `palka` has been updated to a list of integers, which is the list of integers from the input. The value of `pl` remains an empty list. The value of `d` remains an empty dictionary. The value of `stdin` has been updated to `t-ln-2` test cases, since two inputs have been read. The value of `i` has been updated to the last element of the list `palka`. The value of `_` remains 1. The value of `j` remains the last element in the list `pl`, which is still an empty list. The value of `shapes` remains unchanged, since the count of `j` in the original `palka` list is not 3 or more.
