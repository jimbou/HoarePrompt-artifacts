Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 3 elements. `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka`. `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the third element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is 1 if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, otherwise its value is incremented by 1. `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. `i` is the third element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` remains unchanged, it is still a positive integer less than or equal to 100 and greater than 2. The value of `ln` remains unchanged, it is still 0. The value of `palka` remains unchanged, it is still a list with at least 3 elements. The value of `pl` has changed, it now contains the third element of `palka` because `i` was appended to `pl`. The value of `d` remains unchanged, it is still a dictionary where the key `i` (the third element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is 1 if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, otherwise its value is incremented by 1. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, it still contains t-3 test cases. The value of `i` remains unchanged, it is still the third element in the list `palka`. The value of `j` remains unchanged, it is still not defined. The value of `_` remains unchanged, it is still 2. The value of `shapes` remains unchanged, it is still not defined.
