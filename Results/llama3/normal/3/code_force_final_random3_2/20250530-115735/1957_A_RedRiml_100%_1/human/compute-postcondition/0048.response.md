Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list of integers and the first element in the list `palka` is appended to it, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, otherwise `d[i]` is one more than its previous value, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the first element in the list `palka` and is not in `pl` before appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl` and is now the second last element in the list `pl`, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is unchanged, and `i` is now in `pl`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `w` and `ln` remains the same. The list `palka` remains the same. The list `pl` now has one more element which is the first element in the list `palka`. The dictionary `d` remains the same. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same. The current value of `i` remains the same but is now in `pl`. The current value of `j` is now the second last element in the list `pl`. The value of `_` remains the same. The value of `shapes` remains the same.
