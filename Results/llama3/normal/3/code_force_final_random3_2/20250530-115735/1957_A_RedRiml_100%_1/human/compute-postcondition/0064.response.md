The only object in the loop head is variable `j` and list `pl`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If the list `pl` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list `pl` must have at least 1 element and the `j` is the first element in the list `pl`.
State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the first element in the list `pl`, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is 0**
