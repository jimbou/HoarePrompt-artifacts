Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, ln is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, palka is a list of integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-ln-2 test cases, i is the last element of the list palka, the current value of _ is 1, j is the last element in the list pl, shapes is unchanged
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list of integers and the first element in the list `palka` is appended to it if it was not previously in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, otherwise `d[i]` is one more than its previous value, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the first element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl` and is now the second last element in the list `pl` if `i` was appended, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `pl` is a list of integers and the first element in the list `palka` is appended to it if it was not previously in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, otherwise `d[i]` is one more than its previous value, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the second element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl` and is now the second last element in the list `pl` if `i` was appended, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is unchanged. If `i` was not previously in `d`, then `d[i]` is now 1. If `i` was previously in `d`, then `d[i]` is now 2. The first element in the list `palka` is appended to `pl` if it was not previously in `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list of integers and the first element in the list `palka` is appended to it if it was not previously in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, otherwise `d[i]` is one more than its previous value, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the third element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl` and is now the second last element in the list `pl` if `i` was appended, the current value of `_` is 1, and `shapes` is unchanged. If `i` was not previously in `d`, then `d[i]` is now 1. If `i` was previously in `d` and had a value of 1, then `d[i]` is now 2. If `i` was previously in `d` and had a value of 3, then `d[i]` is now 4. Otherwise, `d[i]` is one more than its previous value. The first element in the list `palka` is appended to `pl` if it was not previously in `pl`. The list `pl` now has the third element of `palka` appended to it if `i` was not previously in `pl`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
