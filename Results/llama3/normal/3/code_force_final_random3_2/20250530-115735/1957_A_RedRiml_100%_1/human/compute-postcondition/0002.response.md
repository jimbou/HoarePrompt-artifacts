Output State: **w is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, ln is a positive integer and less or equal than 100, palka is a list of ln integers, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer and less or equal than 100. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 100, _ is 0**

The code executes four lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `ln`. The second line assigns a list of `ln` integers from stdin to `palka`. The third line initializes an empty list `pl`. The fourth line initializes an empty dictionary `d`. The value of `w` and `_` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains t-2 test cases.
