Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer and less or equal than 100. The integers in the list are positive integers and less or equal than 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += d[j] // 3
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is an empty list, `pl` is a list of integers that contains all unique elements from the original `palka` list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its corresponding value is the count of that element in the original `palka` list, `stdin` contains `t-ln` test cases, `i` is the last element of the original `palka` list, the current value of `_` is 0, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`. If the count of `j` in the original `palka` list is 3 or more, `shapes` is increased by the count of `j` in the original `palka` list divided by 3. Otherwise, `shapes` remains unchanged, and the value of `shapes` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list that contains at least 3 occurrences of the value `j`, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(pl)` elements and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the last element in the list `pl` and has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1. If `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, `shapes` is equal to the sum of the number of times each element in `pl` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0, and the number of shapes is printed, where the number of shapes is the sum of the number of times each element in `pl` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, since `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2, `ln` is 0, `palka` is a list, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the frequency of that element in `palka`, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `i` is the last element in the list `palka`, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `_` is 2, `shapes` is increased by the integer division of the frequency of each element in `pl` by 3 if the frequency is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0, and the value of `shapes` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
