Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 2 elements. `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka` if `i` was not in `pl` before, otherwise `pl` is an empty list. `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the second element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is incremented by 1. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
