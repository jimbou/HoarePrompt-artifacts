Output State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary that has a key `i` with a value that is one more than its previous value, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1, `j` is the last element in the list `pl`, `shapes` is unchanged**

In this output state, the value of `d[i]` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `d` still has a key `i`, but its value is now one more than its previous value. All other conditions and values of the variables are the same as in the initial state.
