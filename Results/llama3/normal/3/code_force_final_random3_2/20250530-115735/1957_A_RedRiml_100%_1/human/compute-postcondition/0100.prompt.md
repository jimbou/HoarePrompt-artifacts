Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: w is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 2, ln is 0, palka is an empty list, pl is an empty list, d is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is not defined, j is not defined, _ is 2, shapes is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 1 element. `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` if `i` was not in `pl` before, otherwise `pl` is an empty list. `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the first element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is 1 if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, otherwise its value is incremented by 1. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. `i` is the first element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 2 elements. `pl` is a list containing the second element of `palka` if `i` was not in `pl` before, otherwise `pl` is an empty list. `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the second element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is 1 if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, otherwise its value is incremented by 1. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` contains the second element of `palka`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is a list with at least 3 elements. `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka` if `i` was not in `pl` before, otherwise `pl` is an empty list. `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the third element in the list `palka`) is defined, and its value is 1 if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, otherwise its value is incremented by 1. `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. `i` is the third element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is not defined. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` is updated to contain the third element of `palka`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
