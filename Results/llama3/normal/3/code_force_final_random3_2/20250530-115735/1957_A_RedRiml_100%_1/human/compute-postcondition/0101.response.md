Output State: **`w` is a positive integer, less than or equal to 100, and greater than 2. `ln` is 0. `palka` is an empty list. `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`. `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the frequency of that element in `palka`. `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. `i` is the last element in the list `palka`. `j` is not defined. `_` is 2. `shapes` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `shapes` which is initialized to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
