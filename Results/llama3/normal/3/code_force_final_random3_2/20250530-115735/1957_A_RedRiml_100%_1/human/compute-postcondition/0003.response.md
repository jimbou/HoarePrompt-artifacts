To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which is `i` and `palka`. The loop will execute if `palka` has at least one element. Since `palka` is a list of `ln` integers, we can adjust the state to ensure that `ln` is greater than 0, which means `palka` has at least one element. Additionally, we can set `i` to the first element of `palka`.

State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list of `ln` integers and has at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `i` is the first element of `palka`, `_` is 0**
