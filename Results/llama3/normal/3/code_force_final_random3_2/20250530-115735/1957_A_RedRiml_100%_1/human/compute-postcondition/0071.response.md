To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in pl:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `j` and `pl`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `pl`. If `pl` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `pl` has at least 2 elements, and `j` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `pl` must have at least 3 elements, and `j` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`w` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 1, `ln` is a positive integer and less or equal than 100 and greater than 0, `palka` is a list that contains at least 3 occurrences of the value `j`, `pl` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements and contains all elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is the number of times `i` appeared in `palka`, `stdin` contains `t-ln-2` test cases, the current value of `i` is the last element in the list `palka` and is in `pl` after appending, the current value of `j` is the third element in the list `pl` and has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, the current value of `_` is 1. If `j` has appeared at least 3 times in `palka`, `shapes` is equal to the number of times `j` appeared in `palka` divided by 3, otherwise `shapes` remains 0.**
