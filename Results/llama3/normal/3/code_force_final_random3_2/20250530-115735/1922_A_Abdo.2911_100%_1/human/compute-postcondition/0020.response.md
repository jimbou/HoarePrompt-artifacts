Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 1. If `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True.***
