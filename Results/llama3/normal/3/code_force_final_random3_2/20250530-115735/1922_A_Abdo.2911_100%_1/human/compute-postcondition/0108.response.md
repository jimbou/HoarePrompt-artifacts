Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is n. If there exists at least one index i where a[i] is not equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i] and c[i] is not equal to b[i], or if there exists at least one index i where a[i] is equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
