Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, possible is False, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

Explanation:
The code reads `t` test cases from stdin, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from stdin, and assigns them to the corresponding variables. It also reads an integer `n` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `possible` is initialized to `False`. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0. After executing the code, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.
