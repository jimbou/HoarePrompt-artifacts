Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0, and the current value of a[i] is equal to the current value of b[i]. If the current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of a[i], then possible is True. Otherwise, the value of possible remains unchanged.***
