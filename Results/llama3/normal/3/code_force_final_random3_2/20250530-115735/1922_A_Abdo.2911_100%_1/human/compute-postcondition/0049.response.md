Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a string equal to the second input, `b` is a string equal to the third input, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration with `possible` remaining False. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True.***
