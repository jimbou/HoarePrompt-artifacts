Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 0, n is greater than 0. If the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, then possible is True. Otherwise, the state of possible remains unchanged.**
