Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is at least 1, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 0. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then if c[i] is not equal to a[i], possible is True, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if c[i] is equal to either a[i] or b[i], the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped and possible remains False, otherwise possible is set to True.***
