Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is at least 2, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 1. If c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Otherwise, possible is True.***
