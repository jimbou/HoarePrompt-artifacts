Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 2, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the character at index i in string a is equal to the character at index i in string b, then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or b[i], then i is 3. Otherwise, i is 2 and possible is True. If the character at index i in string a is not equal to the character at index i in string b, then if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, then possible is True.***
