Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is at least 1, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 0. If the current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of a[i], then possible is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
