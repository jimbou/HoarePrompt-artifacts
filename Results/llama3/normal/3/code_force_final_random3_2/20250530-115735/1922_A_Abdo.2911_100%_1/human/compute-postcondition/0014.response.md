Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then if c[i] is not equal to a[i], possible is set to True. Otherwise, the value of possible remains unchanged. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if c[i] is equal to either a[i] or b[i], possible remains False. Otherwise, possible is set to True.***
