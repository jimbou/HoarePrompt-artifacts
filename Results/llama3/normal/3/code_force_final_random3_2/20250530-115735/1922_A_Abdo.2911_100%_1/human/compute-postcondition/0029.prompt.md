Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, possible is False, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then if c[i] is not equal to a[i], possible is set to True. Otherwise, the value of possible remains unchanged. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if c[i] is equal to either a[i] or b[i], possible remains False. Otherwise, possible is set to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or b, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, possible is set to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 2, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the character at index i in string a is equal to the character at index i in string b, then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or b[i], then i is 3. Otherwise, i is 2 and possible is True. If the character at index i in string a is not equal to the character at index i in string b, then if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, then possible is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
