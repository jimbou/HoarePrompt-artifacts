Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. 

The program iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c. If it finds a position where a[i] is equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i], or if it finds a position where a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], it sets the variable "possible" to True and breaks out of the loop. 

After checking all positions, if "possible" is True, it prints 'YES', indicating that there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
