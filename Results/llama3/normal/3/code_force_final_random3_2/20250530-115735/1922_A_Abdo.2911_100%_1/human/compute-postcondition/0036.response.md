Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If there exists an index i such that a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], or if there exists an index i such that a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
