Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 1. If c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, possible is True.***
