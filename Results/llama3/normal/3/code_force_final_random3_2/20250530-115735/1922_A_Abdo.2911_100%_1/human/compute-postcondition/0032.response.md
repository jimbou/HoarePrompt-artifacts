Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of possible is True, indicating that there exists an index i such that a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], or there exists an index i such that a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]. The current value of i is n, and 'YES' is being printed**
