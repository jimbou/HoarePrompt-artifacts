Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 1 and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 1. The only change is that the `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration.
