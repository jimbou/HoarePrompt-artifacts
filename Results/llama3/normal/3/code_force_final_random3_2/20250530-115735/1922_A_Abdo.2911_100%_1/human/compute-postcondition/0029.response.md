Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, possible is True if there exists an index i such that a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], or if there exists an index i such that a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], otherwise possible is False, i is n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable "possible" will be set to True if there exists at least one index i where the characters at index i in strings a and b are different and the character at index i in string c is different from both characters at index i in strings a and b, or if there exists at least one index i where the characters at index i in strings a and b are the same and the character at index i in string c is different from the characters at index i in strings a and b. Otherwise, "possible" will be False. The loop counter "i" will be equal to the length of the strings "n". The other variables "t", "a", "b", "c", and "stdin" remain unchanged.
