Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is at least 3, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is 2. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or string b, then we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, possible is True.***
