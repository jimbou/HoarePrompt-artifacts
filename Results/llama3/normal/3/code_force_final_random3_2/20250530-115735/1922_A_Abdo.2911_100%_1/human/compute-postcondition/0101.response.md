Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is n, possible is True if there exists at least one index i where a[i] is not equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i] and c[i] is not equal to b[i], or if there exists at least one index i where a[i] is equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i]. Otherwise, possible is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 't' remains unchanged, 'n' remains the same as the integer value of the first input, 'a', 'b', and 'c' remain the same as the second, third, and fourth inputs respectively, and 'stdin' still contains 't-4' test cases. The variable 'i' is now equal to 'n' since the loop iterates 'n' times. The variable 'possible' is set to True if there is at least one index 'i' where 'a[i]' is not equal to 'b[i]' and 'c[i]' is not equal to 'a[i]' and 'c[i]' is not equal to 'b[i]', or if there is at least one index 'i' where 'a[i]' is equal to 'b[i]' and 'c[i]' is not equal to 'a[i]'. Otherwise, 'possible' is False.
