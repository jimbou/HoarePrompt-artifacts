Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If there exists an index i such that a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], or if there exists an index i such that a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n. If there exists at least one index j in the range [0, n) such that a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is not equal to a[j] and c[j] is not equal to b[j], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is n. If there exists at least one index i where a[i] is not equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i] and c[i] is not equal to b[i], or if there exists at least one index i where a[i] is equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
