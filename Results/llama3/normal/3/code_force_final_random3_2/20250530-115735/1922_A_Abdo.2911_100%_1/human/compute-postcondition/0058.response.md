The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is at least 3, `a` is a string equal to the second input, `b` is a string equal to the third input, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 2**
