Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is n, possible is False**

The code snippet reads the first four inputs from stdin and assigns them to variables n, a, b, and c, respectively. The variable possible is initialized to False. The values of t and i remain unchanged. The state of stdin is updated to contain t-4 test cases.
