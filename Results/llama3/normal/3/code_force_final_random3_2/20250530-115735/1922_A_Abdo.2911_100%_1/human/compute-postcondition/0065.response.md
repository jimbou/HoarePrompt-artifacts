Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-5 test cases, i is n, possible is True if there exists at least one index j in the range [0, n) such that a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is not equal to a[j] and c[j] is not equal to b[j], otherwise possible is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The value of t remains unchanged, ranging from 2 to 1000. The value of n remains the same as the integer value of the first input. The strings a, b, and c retain their initial values as the second, third, and fourth inputs, respectively. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases. The loop counter i is now equal to n, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The variable possible is set to True if there exists at least one index j within the range [0, n) where a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is not equal to both a[j] and b[j]. If no such index exists, possible remains False.
