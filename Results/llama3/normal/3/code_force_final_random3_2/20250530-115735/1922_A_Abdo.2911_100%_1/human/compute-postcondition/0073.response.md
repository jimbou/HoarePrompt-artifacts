The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is n. If there exists at least one index j in the range [0, n) such that a[j] is not equal to b[j] and c[j] is not equal to a[j] and c[j] is not equal to b[j], then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
