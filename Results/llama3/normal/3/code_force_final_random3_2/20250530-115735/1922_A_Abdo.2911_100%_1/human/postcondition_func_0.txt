This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by three strings a, b, and c. It then checks if there exists at least one position i where a[i] is not equal to c[i] and b[i] is not equal to c[i], or if there exists at least one position i where a[i] is equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i]. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
