Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a string equal to the second input, `b` is a string equal to the third input, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input, `possible` is False, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration, due to the `continue` statement.
