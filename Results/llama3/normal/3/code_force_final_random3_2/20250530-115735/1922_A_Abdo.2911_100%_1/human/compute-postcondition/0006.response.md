Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, possible is True, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 0, the current value of a[i] is equal to the current value of b[i], and the current value of c[i] is not equal to the current value of a[i].**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`, which was initially `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the only change in the state is that `possible` is now `True`, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
