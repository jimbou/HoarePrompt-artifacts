Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'NO'. This is because the variable `possible` is set to `False`, indicating that the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` are not met. The `print` statement is not dependent on any other variables or conditions, so it will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
