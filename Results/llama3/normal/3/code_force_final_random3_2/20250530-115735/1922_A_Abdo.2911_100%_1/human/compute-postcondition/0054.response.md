Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is at least 2, `a` is a string equal to the second input, `b` is a string equal to the third input, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-5 test cases, `i` is 1 and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases. The value of `i` is still 1. However, the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.
