Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 0, n is greater than 0, possible is False, and a[i] is not equal to b[i]. The current value of c[i] is either equal to a[i] or equal to b[i]. We skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the "continue" statement only skips the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and moves to the next iteration, without changing any variable values.
