Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 0, n is greater than 0. If c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement and move to the next iteration with possible being False. If c[i] is neither equal to a[i] nor equal to b[i], possible is set to True.***
