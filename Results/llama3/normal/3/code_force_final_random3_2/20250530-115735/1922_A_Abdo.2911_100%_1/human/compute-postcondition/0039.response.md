To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, we can assume that the first input is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `a` is a string equal to the second input, `b` is a string equal to the third input, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input, `possible` is False, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `i` is 0**
