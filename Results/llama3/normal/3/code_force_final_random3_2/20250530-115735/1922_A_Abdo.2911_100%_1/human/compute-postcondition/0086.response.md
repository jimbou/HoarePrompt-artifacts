Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 0, n is greater than 0. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, possible is True. Otherwise, the state of possible remains unchanged. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and we move to the next iteration with possible being False. If c[i] is neither equal to a[i] nor equal to b[i], possible is set to True.***
