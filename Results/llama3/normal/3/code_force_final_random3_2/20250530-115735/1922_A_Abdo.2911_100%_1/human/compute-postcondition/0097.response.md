The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since we are directly inside a loop, we move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string equal to the second input, `b` is a string equal to the third input, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `i` is 2 and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
