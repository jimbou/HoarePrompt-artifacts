The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = True` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables but rather controls the flow of the program.

Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the only change to the initial state is the assignment of `True` to the variable `possible`.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 2, possible is True**
