Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `possible` remains False and we move on to the next iteration of the loop. If `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to True.***
