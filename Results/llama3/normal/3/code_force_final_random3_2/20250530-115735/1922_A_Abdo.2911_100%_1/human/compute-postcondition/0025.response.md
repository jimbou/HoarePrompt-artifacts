The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since `i` is 2, the current iteration is skipped, and the next iteration will start with `i` being 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 3**
