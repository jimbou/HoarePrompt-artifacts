Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is n, possible is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 0, n is greater than 0. If a[i] is equal to b[i], then if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a, possible is True. Otherwise, the state of possible remains unchanged. If a[i] is not equal to b[i], then if c[i] is equal to a[i] or c[i] is equal to b[i], the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement is skipped and we move to the next iteration with possible being False. If c[i] is neither equal to a[i] nor equal to b[i], possible is set to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 1. If the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a and the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string b, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, possible is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 2. If the character at index i in string a is equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a. Otherwise, if the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string b, then we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, possible is set to True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
