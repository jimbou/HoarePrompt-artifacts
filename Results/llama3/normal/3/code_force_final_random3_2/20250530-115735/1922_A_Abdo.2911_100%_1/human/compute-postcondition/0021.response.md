Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n is greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, c is a string, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is 1. If the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or b, we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. Otherwise, possible is set to True.***
