Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a string equal to the second input, `b` is a string equal to the third input, `c` is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, `i` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
