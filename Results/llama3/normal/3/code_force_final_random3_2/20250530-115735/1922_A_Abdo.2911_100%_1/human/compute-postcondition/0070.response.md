Based on the initial state, the code will print 'NO' because the variable `possible` is set to `False`, indicating that there does not exist any index `j` in the range `[0, n)` such that `a[j]` is not equal to `b[j]` and `c[j]` is not equal to `a[j]` and `c[j]` is not equal to `b[j]`.

Output: **NO**
