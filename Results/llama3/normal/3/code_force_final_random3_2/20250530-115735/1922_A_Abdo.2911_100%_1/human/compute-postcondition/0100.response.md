Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 2, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, i is 2. If the character at index i in string a is equal to the character at index i in string b, then possible is True if the character at index i in string c is not equal to the character at index i in string a. Otherwise, if the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string a or the character at index i in string c is equal to the character at index i in string b, then we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, possible is set to True.**
