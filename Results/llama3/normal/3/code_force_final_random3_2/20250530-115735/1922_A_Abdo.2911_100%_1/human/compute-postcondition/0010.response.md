The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the current value of `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the value of `possible` is still False.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `c` is a string, `possible` is False, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
