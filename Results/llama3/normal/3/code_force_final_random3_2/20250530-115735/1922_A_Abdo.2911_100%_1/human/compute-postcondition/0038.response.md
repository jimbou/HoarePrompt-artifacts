Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer equal to the integer value of the first input, a is a string equal to the second input, b is a string equal to the third input, c is a string equal to the fourth input, possible is False, stdin contains t-5 test cases.**

In this final state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the first input from stdin. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated to the second, third, and fourth inputs from stdin, respectively, after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `possible` has been initialized to `False`. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 4, as 4 inputs have been consumed by the code. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the code.
