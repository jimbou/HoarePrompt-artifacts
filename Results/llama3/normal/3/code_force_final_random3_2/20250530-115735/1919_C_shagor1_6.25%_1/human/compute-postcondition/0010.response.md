Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is an integer equal to `n` + 1, `a` is the first element in `inp`, stdin contains 0 inputs, and `a` is larger than `x`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to the first element in `inp`. Otherwise, `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is set to 1.***
