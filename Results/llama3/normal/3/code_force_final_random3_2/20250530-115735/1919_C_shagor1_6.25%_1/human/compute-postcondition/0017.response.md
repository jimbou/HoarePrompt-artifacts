Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a`. Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a`, otherwise `ans` is set to 1.***
