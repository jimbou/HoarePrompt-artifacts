This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (array size) followed by a list of integers (array elements). It then finds the smallest and second smallest elements in the array, counts the number of elements greater than the second smallest element, and prints this count. The function repeats this process for all test cases in the input.
