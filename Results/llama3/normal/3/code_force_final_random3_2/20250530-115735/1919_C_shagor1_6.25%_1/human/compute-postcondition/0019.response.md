Output State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `x` is equal to `a`, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is assigned the value of `a`, which is the third element in the list `inp`. The values of `n`, `inp`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 0 inputs.
