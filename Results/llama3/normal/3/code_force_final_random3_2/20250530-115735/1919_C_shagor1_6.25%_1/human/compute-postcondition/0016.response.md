Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `x` is either `a` or `n` + 1, `y` is either `a` or `n` + 1, `ans` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.***
