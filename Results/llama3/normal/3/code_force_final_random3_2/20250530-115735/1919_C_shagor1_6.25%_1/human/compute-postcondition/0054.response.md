The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer from stdin, `inp` is a list of integers from stdin, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`, `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are larger than the second smallest integer in `inp`, `stdin` contains at least 2 inputs, and the number of integers in `inp` that are larger than the second smallest integer in `inp` which is `ans` is being printed**
