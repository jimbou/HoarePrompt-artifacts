The value of `y` is updated to be equal to `a`. The previous value of `y` was `n+1`, but now it is equal to `a`. The value of `a` is the first integer in the list `inp`, and it is larger than `x` (which is `n+1`) and less than or equal to `y` (which was `n+1`). Since `a` is now equal to `y`, we can conclude that `a` is equal to `n+1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `n+1`, `y` is `a` which is equal to `n+1`, `ans` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 input, `a` is the first integer in the list, `a` is equal to `n+1`.**
