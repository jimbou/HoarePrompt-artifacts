Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element in `inp`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `a` is less than or equal to `n` + 1, then `x` is set to `a`. If `a` is larger than `n` + 1, then `x` remains `n` + 1. If `a` is less than or equal to `n` + 1, then `y` remains `n` + 1. If `a` is larger than `n` + 1, then if `a` is less than or equal to `n` + 1, then `y` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is set to 1.***
