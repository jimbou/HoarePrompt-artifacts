Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `a` is the second element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is the second element in the list `inp`. Otherwise, `x` is the second element in the list `inp`, `y` is the second element in the list `inp`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.***
