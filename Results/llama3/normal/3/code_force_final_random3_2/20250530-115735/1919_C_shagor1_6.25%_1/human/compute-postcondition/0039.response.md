To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `a` and `inp`. The loop will execute again if `inp` has at least one more integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, `inp` has at least 1 integer, and `a` is the first integer in the list. For the loop to execute again, `inp` must have at least 2 integers, and `a` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the second integer in the list.**
