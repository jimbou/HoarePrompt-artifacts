The code assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is the second element in the list `inp`, `y` will also be the second element in the list `inp`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `a` is the second element in the list `inp`, `y` is the second element in the list `inp`.**
