Output State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `x` is `a`, `y` is either `n` + 1 or `a`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to `a`, which is the second element in the list `inp`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains 0 inputs.
