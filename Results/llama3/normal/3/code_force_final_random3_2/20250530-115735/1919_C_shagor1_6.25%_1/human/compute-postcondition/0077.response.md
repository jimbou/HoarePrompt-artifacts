Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `a` is the third element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is the third element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is the third element in the list `inp`. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `x` is the third element in the list `inp`, `y` is the third element in the list `inp`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.***
