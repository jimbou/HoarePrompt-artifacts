The first line checks if `x` is equal to `y`, but it does not modify any variables. The second line assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is larger than `x` and `y`, `y` becomes larger than `x`. The third line increments `ans` by 1, making `ans` equal to 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is an integer equal to n + 1, y is an integer equal to a, ans is 1, a is the first element in inp, stdin contains 0 inputs, a is larger than x, and y is larger than x**
