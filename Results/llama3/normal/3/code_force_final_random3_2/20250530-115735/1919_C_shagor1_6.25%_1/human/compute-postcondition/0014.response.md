The code `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to `y`. The value of `a` is the second element in the list `inp`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`, `x` is either `a` or `n` + 1, `y` is `a`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 inputs**
