Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `inp`, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is equal to `a` (the third element in `inp`). Otherwise, `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is equal to `a`, and `ans` is equal to its original value plus 1.***
