Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `a` is the third integer in the list, `y` is equal to `a`, stdin contains at least 1 input.**

In this output state, the value of `y` is assigned the value of `a`, which is the third integer in the list `inp`. The values of `n`, `inp`, and `a` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 input.
