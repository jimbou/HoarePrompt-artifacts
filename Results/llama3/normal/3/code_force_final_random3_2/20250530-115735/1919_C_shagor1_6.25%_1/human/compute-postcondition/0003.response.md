Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is an integer equal to `n` + 1, `y` is an integer equal to `n` + 1, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element in `inp`, stdin contains 0 inputs. The current value of `a` is less than or equal to the current value of `x`.**
