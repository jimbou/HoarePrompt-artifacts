Postcondition: ***n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the second integer in the list. If a is less than or equal to x, then x is equal to a. Otherwise, if a is less than or equal to y, then y is equal to a. If a is greater than y, then x is equal to a, y is equal to a, and ans is incremented by 1.***
