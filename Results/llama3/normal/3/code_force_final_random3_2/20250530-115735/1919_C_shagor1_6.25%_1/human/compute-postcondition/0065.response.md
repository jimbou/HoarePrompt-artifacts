Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `a` is the first element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is set to `a`, `y` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is 0, otherwise `y` is greater than `n + 1` and `ans` is 1.***
