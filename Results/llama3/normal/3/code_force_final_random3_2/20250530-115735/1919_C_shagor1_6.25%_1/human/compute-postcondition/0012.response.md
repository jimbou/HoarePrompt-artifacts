To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `a` and `inp`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `inp` has at least 1 element, and `a` is the first element in `inp`. For the loop to execute again, `inp` must have at least 2 elements, and `a` must be the second element in `inp`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element in `inp`, stdin contains 0 inputs, `x` is either `a` or `n` + 1, `y` is either `n` + 1 or `a`, `ans` is either 0 or 1**
