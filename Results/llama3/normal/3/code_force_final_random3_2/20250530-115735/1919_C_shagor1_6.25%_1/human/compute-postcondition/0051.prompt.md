Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers from stdin, x is n+1, y is n+1, ans is 0, stdin contains at least 1 input
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the first integer in the list. If a is less than or equal to n+1, then x is set to the first integer in the list, y remains n+1, and ans remains 0. If a is larger than n+1, then x remains n+1, y is set to either a (which is equal to n+1) or the first integer in the list, and ans is set to either 0 or 1. Additionally, if a is less than or equal to y, then a is set to n+1, otherwise a is larger than x and larger than the original value of y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the second integer in the list. If a is less than or equal to x, then x is equal to a. Otherwise, if a is less than or equal to y, then y is equal to a. If a is greater than y, then x is equal to a, y is equal to a, and ans is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the third integer in the list. If a is less than or equal to x, then x is equal to a. If a is less than or equal to y, then y is equal to a. Otherwise, x is equal to a, y is equal to a, and ans is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
