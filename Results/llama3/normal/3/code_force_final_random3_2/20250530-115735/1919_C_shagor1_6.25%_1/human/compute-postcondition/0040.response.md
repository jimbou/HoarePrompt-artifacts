Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `a` is the second integer in the list, `x` is equal to `a`, stdin contains at least 1 input.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is assigned the value of `a`, which is the second integer in the list `inp`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `inp` still has at least 2 integers, and `a` is still the second integer in the list. The stdin still contains at least 1 input.
