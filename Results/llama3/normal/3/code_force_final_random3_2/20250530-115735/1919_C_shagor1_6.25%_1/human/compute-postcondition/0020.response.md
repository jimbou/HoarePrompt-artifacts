Output State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element in `inp`, `y` is equal to `a` (the third element in `inp`), stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `y` is now equal to the third element in the list `inp`, which is also the value of `a`. The values of `n` and `inp` remain unchanged, and there are still no inputs in the standard input (stdin).
