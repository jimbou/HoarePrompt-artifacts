The only objects in the loop head are variables  a and inp, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the inp.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, inp has at least 2 integers, a is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the a is the third integer in the list.
State: **n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the third integer in the list**
