Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, inp is a list of integers, x is n + 1, y is n + 1, ans is 0, stdin contains at least 1 input
Code of the loop:
for a in inp:
    if a <= x:
        x = a
    elif a <= y:
        y = a
    else:
        x == y
        y = a
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `a` is the first element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `x` is set to `a`, `y` is `n + 1`, and `ans` is 0. If `a` is greater than `n + 1`, then `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `a`, and if `a` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `y` is set to `a` and `ans` is 0, otherwise `y` is greater than `n + 1` and `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `a` is the second element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is the second element in the list `inp`. Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is the second element in the list `inp`. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `x` is the second element in the list `inp`, `y` is the second element in the list `inp`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `a` is the third element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is the third element in the list `inp`. If `a` is less than or equal to `y`, then `y` is the third element in the list `inp`. If `a` is greater than `y`, then `x` is the third element in the list `inp`, `y` is the third element in the list `inp`, and `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
