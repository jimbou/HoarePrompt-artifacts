The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of elements in the original list `inp` that are greater than the second smallest element `y`.
Since the exact elements in the list `inp` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of elements in the list `inp` that are greater than the second smallest element.
Output: **the number of elements in the original list inp that are greater than the second smallest element y**
