The first line checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since `x` is either `a` or `n + 1`, and `y` is either `n + 1` or `a`, this condition will be true if both `x` and `y` are equal to `a` or both are equal to `n + 1`. The second line assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is the second element in `inp`, `y` becomes the second element in `inp`. The third line increments `ans` by 1. Since `ans` is either 0 or 1, `ans` becomes 1.

Output State: **n is an integer, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, a is the second element in inp, x is either a or n + 1, y is the second element in inp, ans is 1**
