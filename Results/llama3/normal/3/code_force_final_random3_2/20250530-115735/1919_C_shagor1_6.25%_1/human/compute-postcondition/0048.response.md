Output State: **n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the third integer in the list, x is equal to a, y is equal to a, ans is incremented by 1**

The first line `x == y` does not affect any variables because it is a comparison statement and does not assign any values. The second line `y = a` assigns the value of `a` to `y`, making `y` equal to the third integer in the list `inp`. The third line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `x` is equal to `y` and `y` is equal to `a`, `x` is also equal to `a`. No other variables are affected.
