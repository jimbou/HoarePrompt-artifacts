The code prints the number of integers in the list `inp` that are larger than the second smallest integer in `inp`. Since `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp` and `ans` is the count of integers in `inp` that are larger than `y`, the print statement will output the value of `ans`, which represents the number of integers in `inp` greater than the second smallest integer `y`.

Output: **the number of integers in inp that are larger than the second smallest integer in inp**
