Postcondition: ***n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the first integer in the list. If a is less than or equal to n+1, then x is set to the first integer in the list, y remains n+1, and ans remains 0. If a is larger than n+1, then x remains n+1, y is set to either a (which is equal to n+1) or the first integer in the list, and ans is set to either 0 or 1. Additionally, if a is less than or equal to y, then a is set to n+1, otherwise a is larger than x and larger than the original value of y.***
