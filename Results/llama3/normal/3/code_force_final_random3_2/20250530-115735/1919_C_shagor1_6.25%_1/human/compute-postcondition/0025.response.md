The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of integers in the list `inp` that are larger than the second smallest integer in `inp`. The second smallest integer in `inp` is `y`. Therefore, the code prints the count of integers in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

Output: **the number of integers in inp that are larger than y (the second smallest integer in inp)**
