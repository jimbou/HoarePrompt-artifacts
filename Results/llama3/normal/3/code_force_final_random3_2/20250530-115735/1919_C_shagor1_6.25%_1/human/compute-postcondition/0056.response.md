To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `a` and the list `inp`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `inp`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `stdin` contains at least 1 input, we can assume that `inp` has at least 1 element.

At the start of the loop, `a` will take the value of the first element in the list `inp`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `a` is the first element in the list `inp`**
