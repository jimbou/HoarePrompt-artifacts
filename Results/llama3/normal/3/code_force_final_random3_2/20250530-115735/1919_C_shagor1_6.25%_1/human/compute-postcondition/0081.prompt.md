Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the size of the array) and then a list of integers (the elements of the array). The size of the array is a non-negative integer and the elements of the array are non-negative integers less than or equal to the size of the array.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, inp is a list of integers, x is the smallest integer in inp, y is the second smallest integer in inp, ans is the number of integers in inp that are larger than the second smallest integer in inp, stdin contains 0 inputs, and the number of integers in inp that are larger than the second smallest integer in inp which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer from stdin, inp is a list of integers from stdin, x is the smallest integer in inp, y is the second smallest integer in inp, ans is the number of integers in inp that are larger than the second smallest integer in inp, stdin contains at least 1 input, and the number of integers in inp that are larger than the second smallest integer in inp which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `inp` is an empty list, `stdin` contains at least 1 input, `x` is the smallest element in the original list `inp`, `y` is the second smallest element in the original list `inp`, `ans` is the number of elements in the original list `inp` that are greater than the second smallest element, and the number of elements in the original list `inp` that are greater than the second smallest element is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
