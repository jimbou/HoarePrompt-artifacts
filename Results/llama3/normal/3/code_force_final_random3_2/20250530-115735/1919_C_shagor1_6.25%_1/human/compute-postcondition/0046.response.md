Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `a` is the third integer in the list, `x` is the third integer in the list, stdin contains at least 1 input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is now equal to the third integer in the list `inp`, which is also equal to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `inp` still has at least 3 integers, and `n` is still an integer from stdin. The stdin still contains at least 1 input.
