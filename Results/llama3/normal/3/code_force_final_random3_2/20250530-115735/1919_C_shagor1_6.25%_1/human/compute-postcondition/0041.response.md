Output State: **`n` is an integer from stdin, `inp` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `a` is the second integer in the list, `y` is equal to `a`, stdin contains at least 1 input.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `y` is now equal to the second integer in the list `inp`, which is also equal to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least 1 input.
