The first line checks if `x` is equal to `y`, but it does not affect any variables. The second line assigns the value of `a` to `y`. Since `a` is greater than `x` and `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, `y` becomes greater than its original value. The third line increments `ans` by 1, making `ans` equal to 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is an integer, inp is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is n + 1, y is greater than n + 1, ans is 1, stdin contains at least 1 input, a is the first element in the list inp, a is greater than x.**
