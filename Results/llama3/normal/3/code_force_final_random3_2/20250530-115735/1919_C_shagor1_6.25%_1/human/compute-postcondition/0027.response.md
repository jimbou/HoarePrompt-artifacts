The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If the value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, so for the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least 1 input.

State: **`n` is an integer, `inp` is a list of integers, `x` is the smallest integer in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest integer in `inp`, `ans` is the number of integers in `inp` that are larger than the second smallest integer in `inp`, `stdin` contains at least 1 input**
