This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then finds the minimum frequency of any integer in the list and prints this value. If the list is empty or no integer appears more than once, it prints -1. The function processes all test cases and prints the minimum frequency for each case.
