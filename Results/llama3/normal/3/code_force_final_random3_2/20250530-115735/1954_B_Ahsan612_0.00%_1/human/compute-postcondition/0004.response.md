Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, `i`, `stdin`, and `_`. The relationship between `ar[i]` and `num` also remains the same.
