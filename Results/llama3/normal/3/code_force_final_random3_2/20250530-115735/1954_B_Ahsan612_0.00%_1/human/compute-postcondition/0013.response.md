Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is either the first, second, or third integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, `i` is either 3 or 4, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 3 or 4. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.
