Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first, second, or third integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, `i` is either 3 or 4, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
