Output State: **n is an integer greater than 5 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, i is either 4 or 5, num is the integer at index i in ar, minn is 1, same is 1, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, and _ is 2.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 4 or 5. Then, it assigns the value of the integer at the new index `i` in `ar` to `num`. The third line updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value and `same`. Since `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `minn` is initially either 1 or infinity, `minn` will become 1. Finally, the value of `same` is reset to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
