The only variable in the loop head is variable i and len(ar), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and len(ar).  If i is less than len(ar), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is either 3, 4, or 5, and len(ar) is n, which is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5. For the loop to be executed one more time, i must be less than n, so n must be greater than 3, 4, or 5. Since n is already greater than 3, it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 5 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then either `same` is 2, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 4, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2, or `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 4 or 5, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2.**
