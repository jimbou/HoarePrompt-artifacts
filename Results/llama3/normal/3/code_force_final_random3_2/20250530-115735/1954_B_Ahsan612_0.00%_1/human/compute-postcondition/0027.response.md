Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is between 1 and `n`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0. If `minn` is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same` is printed.**
