Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of each number. It then finds the minimum of these counts, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed. If the array consists of a single number, the program correctly outputs -1, as it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

Correctness: **True**
