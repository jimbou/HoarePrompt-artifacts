Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the integer at index i+1 in ar, minn is 1, i is 2, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, and _ is 2.**

The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1, updates `num` to be the integer at the new index `i` in the list `ar`, sets `minn` to the minimum of its current value (infinity) and `same` (1), and resets `same` to 1. The value of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
