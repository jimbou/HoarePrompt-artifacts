The code snippet provided reads in a new value for `n` and a list of `n` integers for `ar` from the standard input. It then initializes `same` to 1, sets `num` to the first integer in `ar`, sets `minn` to infinity, and sets `i` to 1.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, and _ is 1**
