Output State: **n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the integer at index i+1 in ar, minn is 1, i is 2, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, and _ is 1.**

The code block increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 2. Then, it assigns the value of the integer at index `i` (which is now 2) in `ar` to `num`. Since the integer at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to the original `num`, this changes the value of `num`. The code then updates `minn` to be the minimum between its current value (infinity) and `same` (which is 1), making `minn` equal to 1. Finally, it resets `same` to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
