Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, and _ is 2**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is between 1 and 3 * 10^5. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `ar`, where each integer is between 1 and `n`. The variable `same` is initialized to 1, indicating the count of the last sequence of equal integers in `ar`. The variable `num` is assigned the value of the first integer in `ar`. The variable `minn` is initialized to infinity, which will be used to store the minimum value of `same` and `minn`. Finally, the variable `i` is initialized to 1. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2, and stdin now contains `t - 5` test cases.
