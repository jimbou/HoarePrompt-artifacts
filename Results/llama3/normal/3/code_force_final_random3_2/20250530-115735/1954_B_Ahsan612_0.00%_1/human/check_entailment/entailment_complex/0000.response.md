Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the minimum frequency of any integer in the array. If the minimum frequency is infinity (i.e., all elements in the array are the same), the program prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. Otherwise, the program prints the minimum frequency.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. The use of the `inf` variable from the `math` module is a good way to initialize the `minn` variable to a value that is guaranteed to be larger than any possible frequency.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, which is efficient for the given constraints.

The program's output matches the expected output for the provided example inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
