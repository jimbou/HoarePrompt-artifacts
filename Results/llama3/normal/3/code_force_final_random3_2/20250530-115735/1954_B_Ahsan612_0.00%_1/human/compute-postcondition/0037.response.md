The variable in the loop head is variable i and ar, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and ar. If i is less than len(ar), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 3 and ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n. For the loop to be executed one more time, the length of ar must be greater than 3. Since the length of ar is n, n must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1.**
