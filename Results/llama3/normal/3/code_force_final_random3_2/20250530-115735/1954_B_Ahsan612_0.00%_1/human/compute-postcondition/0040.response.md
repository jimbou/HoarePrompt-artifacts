Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1. If none of the above conditions are met, then `n` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `i` is 4, `num` is the integer at index 4 in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1.***
