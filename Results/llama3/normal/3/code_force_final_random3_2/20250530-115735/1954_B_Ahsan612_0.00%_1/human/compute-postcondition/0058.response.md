To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `i < len(ar)`. This means we need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `ar` (specifically, `len(ar)`).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`
- `same` is 1
- `num` is the first integer in `ar`
- `minn` is infinity
- `i` is 1
- `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases
- `_` is 2

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` depends on the value of `i` and the length of `ar`. Since `i` is 1 and `ar` has a length of `n`, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is greater than 1, which directly influences `len(ar)` since `ar` is a list of `n` integers.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2**
