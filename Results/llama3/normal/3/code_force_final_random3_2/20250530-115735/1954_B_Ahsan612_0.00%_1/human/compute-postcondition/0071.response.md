Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 5 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 4, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then either `same` is 3, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 4, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2, or `same` is 2, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 4 or 5, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is now 4. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then either `same` is now 3 or 2, depending on the previous value of `same`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
