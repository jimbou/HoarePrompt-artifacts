Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program works by iterating through the array and counting the number of consecutive occurrences of the same number. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive occurrences seen so far.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It initializes variables to keep track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the same number (`same`) and the minimum count seen so far (`minn`).
4. It iterates through the array, incrementing the count of consecutive occurrences of the same number (`same`) when it encounters the same number.
5. When it encounters a different number, it updates the minimum count seen so far (`minn`) and resets the count of consecutive occurrences (`same`).
6. After iterating through the entire array, it checks if the minimum count seen so far (`minn`) is still infinity. If it is, that means the array consists of only one type of number, and it's impossible to make it stop being beautiful. In this case, it prints -1.
7. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count seen so far (`minn`), which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
