Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the third integer in ar, minn is either 1 or the original value of minn if it was less than 1, i is 3, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and _ is 0**

The code increments `i` by 1, making it 3. Then, it assigns the third integer in `ar` to `num`. The third line updates `minn` to be the minimum of its original value and `same`, which is 1. Since `minn` was either positive infinity or 1, it will now be 1 if it was positive infinity, or remain 1 if it was already 1. The fourth line sets `same` to 1. No other variables are affected.
