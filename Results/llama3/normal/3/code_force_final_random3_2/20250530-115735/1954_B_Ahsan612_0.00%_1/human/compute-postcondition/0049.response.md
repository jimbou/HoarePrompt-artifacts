Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of equal integers in `ar`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is initially the minimum of the current `minn` and `same`, but currently `minn` equals infinity, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1.**
