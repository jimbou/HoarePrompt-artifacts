Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0. If the current value of `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, otherwise `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 3.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are updated to reflect the new value of `i`.
