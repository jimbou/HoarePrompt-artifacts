Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0, `i` is either 4, 5, or 6, if `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first, second, or third integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the (i-1)-th integer in `ar`, `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 4, 5, or 6. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `same`, `num`, and `minn` are still dependent on whether `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, but now `i-1` is either 3, 4, or 5.
