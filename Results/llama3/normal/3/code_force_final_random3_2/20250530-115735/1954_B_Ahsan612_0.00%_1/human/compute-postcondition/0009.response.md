According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `ar`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. `n` being between 1 and 3 * 10^5 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0**
