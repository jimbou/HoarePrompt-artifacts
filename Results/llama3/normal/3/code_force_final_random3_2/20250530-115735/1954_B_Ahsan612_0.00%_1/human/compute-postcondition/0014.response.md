To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `ar` (or more specifically, `len(ar)`) since these are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `len(ar)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3 or 4, and `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, with `n` being an integer greater than 2.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is either 3 or 4, we need to make sure that `len(ar)` is greater than 4. Given that `n` is greater than 2 and `ar` is a list of `n` integers, we can adjust `n` to be greater than 4 to ensure that `len(ar)` is also greater than 4.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, `num` is either the first, second, or third integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, `i` is either 3 or 4, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0**
