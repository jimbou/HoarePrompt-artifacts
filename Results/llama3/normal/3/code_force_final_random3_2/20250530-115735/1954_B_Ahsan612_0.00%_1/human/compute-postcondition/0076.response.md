The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. 

Since `minn` is the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and `same` is the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, the value of `minn` will be updated to be the minimum of these two values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `same` is the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `num` is the most frequent integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2.

Output State: **`same` is the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `num` is the most frequent integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2.**
