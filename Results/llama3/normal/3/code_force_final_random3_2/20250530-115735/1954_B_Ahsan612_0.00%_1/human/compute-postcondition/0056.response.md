The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases in `stdin` the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and stdin contains `t - 4` test cases.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of equal integers in `ar`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the current `minn` and `same`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t - 4` test cases, and `_` is 2**
