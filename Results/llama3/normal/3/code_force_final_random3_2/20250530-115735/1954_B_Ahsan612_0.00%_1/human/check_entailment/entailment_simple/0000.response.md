Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the number of times each integer appears. It maintains a variable `minn` to store the minimum number of times any integer appears in the array. If `minn` is infinity at the end of the iteration, it means that all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program prints -1.

If `minn` is not infinity, it means that there are different integers in the array, and the program prints the minimum number of times any integer appears in the array. This is because removing this minimum number of elements will make the array not beautiful.

The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element, in which case it prints -1.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array has multiple elements, but all elements are the same, in which case it prints -1.

The program correctly handles the case where the array has multiple elements, and not all elements are the same, in which case it prints the minimum number of times any integer appears in the array.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
