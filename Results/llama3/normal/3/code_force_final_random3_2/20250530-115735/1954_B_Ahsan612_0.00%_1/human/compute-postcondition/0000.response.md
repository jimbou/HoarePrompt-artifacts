The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `input()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) such that the list is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be greater than 0 and _ is now 0.
