Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 4, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `num` is either the first, second, or third integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity, 1, or its original value if it was less than 1, and `i` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the i-th integer in `ar` where `i` is either 4 or 5, `minn` is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1, and `i` is either 4 or 5.***
