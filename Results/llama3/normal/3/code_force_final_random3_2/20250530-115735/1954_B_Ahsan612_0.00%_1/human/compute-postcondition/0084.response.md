Output State: **`same` is the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `num` is the most frequent integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains `0` test cases, and `_` is `t`. If `minn` is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar` which is `minn` is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, processing all test cases. The variables `same`, `num`, and `minn` have been updated to reflect the final state of the last test case. The variable `i` has reached the end of the last test case, and the variable `_` has reached the total number of test cases `t`. The input stream `stdin` is now empty, containing no more test cases. The final output is either -1 if `minn` is infinity, indicating that no integer appears more than once in any test case, or the minimum number of times any integer appears in any test case, which is stored in `minn`.
