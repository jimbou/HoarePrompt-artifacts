Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is the count of the last sequence of equal integers in ar, num is the last integer in ar, minn is the minimum count of equal integers in ar, i is n, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, and _ is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates through the list `ar` and keeps track of the count of consecutive equal integers. The variable `same` stores the count of the current sequence of equal integers, `num` stores the current integer being processed, and `minn` stores the minimum count of equal integers encountered so far. The loop continues until it has processed all integers in the list `ar`, at which point `i` is equal to `n`, the length of the list. The other variables, `stdin` and `_`, remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
