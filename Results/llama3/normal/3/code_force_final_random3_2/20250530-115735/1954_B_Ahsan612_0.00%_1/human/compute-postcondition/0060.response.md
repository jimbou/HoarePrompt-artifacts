Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `same` being equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
