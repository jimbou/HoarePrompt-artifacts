Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the first integer in ar, minn is positive infinity, i is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of n has been assigned from the input, and ar has been populated with a list of n integers from the input. The variable same has been initialized to 1, and num has been set to the first integer in ar. The variable minn has been initialized to positive infinity, and i has been set to 1. The stdin now contains t - 1 test cases, as one test case has been processed. The value of _ remains 0, as it was not modified by the code.
