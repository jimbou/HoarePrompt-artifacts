Output State: **n is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, i is 4, num is the integer at index 4 in ar, minn is 1, same is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, and _ is 1.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 4. Then, it assigns the value of the integer at index `i` (which is now 4) in the list `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (which is either 1 or infinity) and the value of `same` (which is either 1 or 2). Since `same` is either 1 or 2, `minn` will always become 1. Finally, the value of `same` is set to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
