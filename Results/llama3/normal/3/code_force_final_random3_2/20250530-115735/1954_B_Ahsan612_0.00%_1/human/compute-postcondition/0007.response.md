Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either the first or second integer in `ar`, `minn` is either positive infinity or 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, otherwise `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the second integer in `ar`, `minn` is set to 1, and `i` is incremented to 2.***
