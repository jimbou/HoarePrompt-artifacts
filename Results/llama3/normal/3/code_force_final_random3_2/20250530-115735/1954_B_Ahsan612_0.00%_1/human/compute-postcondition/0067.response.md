Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, num is the integer at index i in ar, minn is 1, i is 3 or 4, same is 1, stdin contains t - 5 test cases, and _ is 2.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it either 3 or 4, depending on its initial value. Then, it assigns the value of the integer at the new index `i` in `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (either 1 or infinity) and the value of `same` (either 1 or 2), resulting in `minn` being 1. Finally, the value of `same` is set to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
