Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has only one element. In this case, the program will print -1, but the correct output should be -1 because it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that it stops being beautiful.

For example, if the input is:

1
1

The program will print -1, but the correct output should be -1.

The issue is that the program does not handle the case where the input array has only one element correctly. The program assumes that the array will always have at least two elements, but this is not always the case. To fix this issue, the program should add a special case to handle arrays with only one element.
