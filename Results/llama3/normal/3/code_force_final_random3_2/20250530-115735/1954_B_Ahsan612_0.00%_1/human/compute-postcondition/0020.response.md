Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is between 1 and `n`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `same`. All other variables remain unchanged. The input stream still contains `t - 1` test cases.
