Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2.***
