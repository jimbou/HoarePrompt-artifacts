Output State: **`n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 2, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `same` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `ar` still contains `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `num` is still the first integer in `ar`. The value of `minn` is still infinity, and `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is still 1. The current value of `ar[i]` is still equal to `num`.
