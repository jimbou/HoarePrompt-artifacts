To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition, which is `i < len(ar)`. This means we need to focus on the states of `i` and `ar` since these are the variables involved in the loop condition.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`
- `same` is 1
- `num` is the first integer in `ar`
- `minn` is infinity
- `i` is 1
- `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases
- `_` is 1

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` will be true if `i` is less than the length of `ar`. Since `i` is initially 1 and `ar` has `n` elements, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

However, the initial state already specifies that `n` is between 1 and 3 * 10^5, which inherently means `n` can be 1. But for the loop to certainly execute at least once, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 1 because `i` starts at 1.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is greater than 1. The other states do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1**
