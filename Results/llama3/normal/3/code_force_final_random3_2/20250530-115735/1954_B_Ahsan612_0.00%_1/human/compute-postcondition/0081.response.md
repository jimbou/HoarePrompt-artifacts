The code prints the value of `minn`, which is the minimum of the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`. Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it has a finite value.

Output: **the minimum of the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`**
