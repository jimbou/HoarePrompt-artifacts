To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The only object in the loop head is `_` and `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of test cases left in `stdin`. If there is at least one test case left, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least `t - 2` test cases.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is between 1 and `n`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t - 2` test cases, and `_` is 1**
