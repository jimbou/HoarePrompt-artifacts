Precondition: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) such that the list is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
