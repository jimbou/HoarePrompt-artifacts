Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) such that the list is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is between 1 and `n`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and `_` is 0. If `minn` is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of equal integers in `ar`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the current `minn` and `same`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1. If `minn` equals infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the current `minn` and `same` which is equal to `minn` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`same` is the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `num` is the most frequent integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2. If `minn` is infinity, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar` and the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar` which is `minn` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
