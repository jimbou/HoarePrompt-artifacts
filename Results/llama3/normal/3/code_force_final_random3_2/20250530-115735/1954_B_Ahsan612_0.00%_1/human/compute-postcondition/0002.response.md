To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `i < len(ar)`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of `ar`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5
- `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`
- `same` is 1
- `num` is the first integer in `ar`
- `minn` is positive infinity
- `i` is 1
- `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases
- `_` is 0

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar` (through `len(ar)`). Since `i` is already 1 and `ar` has a length of `n`, which is at least 1, the condition for the loop to execute at least once is already met by the given state. There is no need to adjust any states because the loop can certainly execute one time given the initial conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `same` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is positive infinity, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, `_` is 0**
