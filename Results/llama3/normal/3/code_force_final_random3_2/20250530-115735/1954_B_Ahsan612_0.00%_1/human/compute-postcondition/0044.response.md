Output State: **n is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, i is 6, num is the integer at index 6 in ar, minn is 1, same is 1, stdin contains t - 3 test cases, and _ is 1.**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, making it 6. It then assigns the value of the integer at index `i` (which is now 6) in `ar` to `num`. The value of `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`. Since `same` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `minn` is initially infinity, 1, or 1, `minn` becomes 1. Finally, the value of `same` is reset to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
