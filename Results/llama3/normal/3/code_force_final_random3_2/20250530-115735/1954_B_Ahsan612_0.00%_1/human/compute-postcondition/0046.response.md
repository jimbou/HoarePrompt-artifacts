Output State: **`n` is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. If the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 4, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 5, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1. If the current value of `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `num` is the integer at index `i+1` in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 5, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1. If none of the above conditions are met, then `n` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `i` is 6, `num` is the integer at index 6 in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `same` is 2, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, `ar` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, `i` is 7, `num` is the integer at index 7 in `ar`, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `stdin` contains `t - 3` test cases, and `_` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` have been updated accordingly based on the incremented value of `i`.
