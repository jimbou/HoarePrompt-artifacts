Output State: **`same` is the number of times the most frequent integer appears in `ar`, `num` is the most frequent integer in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum number of times any integer appears in `ar`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 5` test cases, and `_` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `same` will hold the count of the most frequent integer in the list `ar`, `num` will be the most frequent integer itself, `minn` will be the minimum count of any integer in `ar`, and `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire list. The values of `stdin` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
