Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is between 1 and n, num is the last integer in ar, minn is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in ar, i is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and _ is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` as in the initial state. The value of `same` will be between 1 and `n`, representing the number of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`. The value of `num` will be the last integer in `ar`. The value of `minn` will be the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in `ar`. The value of `i` will be `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire list `ar`.
