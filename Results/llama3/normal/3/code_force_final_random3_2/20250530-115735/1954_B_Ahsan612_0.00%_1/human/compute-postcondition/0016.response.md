Output State: **n is an integer greater than 4, ar is a list of n integers between 1 and n, same is 1, num is the i-th integer in ar where i is either 4 or 5, minn is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1, i is either 4 or 5, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and _ is 0**

The code block modifies the values of `i`, `num`, `minn`, and `same`. The first line increments `i` by 1, making it either 4 or 5. The second line assigns the `i-th` integer in `ar` to `num`, so `num` becomes the 4th or 5th integer in `ar`. The third line updates `minn` to be the minimum of its original value and `same`, which is either 1 or its original value if it was less than 1. The fourth line sets `same` to 1. The values of `n`, `ar`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged.
