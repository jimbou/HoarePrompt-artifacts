Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program reads multiple test cases, each containing a single integer n representing the size of the matrix.

The program calculates a sum based on the value of n and prints the sum along with the value of n plus an additional calculated value r. It then prints a series of lines representing a matrix, where the first n lines have a specific pattern and the remaining lines have a different pattern.

The program's logic is correct, as it calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing the operations and prints the corresponding matrix. The program also handles multiple test cases correctly, consuming all input from standard input and leaving no test cases remaining.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. The variable 'r' is not correctly calculated. The program should calculate 'r' as the number of rows that can be filled with the maximum possible sum, which is n * (n + 1) // 2. But the program calculates 'r' as the first row that can be filled with the maximum possible sum, which is not correct.

Despite this issue, the program's overall logic is correct, and it produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
