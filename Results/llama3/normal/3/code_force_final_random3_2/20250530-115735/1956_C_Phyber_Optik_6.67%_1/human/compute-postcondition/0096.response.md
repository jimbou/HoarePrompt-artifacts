Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`. Here's what we know about the variables:

* `1` is a literal integer value.
* `j` is equal to `n + 2`, where `n` is at least 2.

Since `n` is at least 2, the minimum value of `j` is 4 (when `n` is 2). However, we don't know the exact value of `n` or `j` without more information.

The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that the output will be separated by a space instead of the default newline character.

Considering the above, the print statement will output the value 1, followed by the value of `j` (which is `n + 2`), separated by a space.

Output: **1 [n + 2] (where n is at least 2)**
