The only variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is greater than 2, i is 3, j is either n or n + 1, r is either 0 or 1, sum is either n * (n + 1) // 2 or n + n * (n + 1) // 2 or n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n or n + 2 * n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
