Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is at least 1.

Since `n` is at least 1, the sequence will start with 1 and end with `n`. The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the `range` object, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a comma-separated list of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a value between 1 and some unknown upper limit (since `n` is at least 1, but its exact value is not specified).

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 1)**
