Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 2, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) + (i * n)` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `i * n + 2 * n`, and `r` is either 1 or 0.***
