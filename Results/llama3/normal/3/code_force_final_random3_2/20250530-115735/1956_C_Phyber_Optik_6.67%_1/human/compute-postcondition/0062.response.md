Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is greater than 0, i is 2, j is either n or n + 1, r is either 0 or 1, sum is either n * (n + 1) // 2 or n + n * (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `_` also remains the same, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is still greater than 0, as the code does not change it.

The value of `i` is 2, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `j` depends on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If this condition is true, then `j` is `n + 1`, otherwise it is `n`.

The value of `r` is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `r` is also 2.

The value of `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `n + n * (n + 1) // 2`, depending on the value of `i` and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If `i` is 2 and the condition is true, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is `n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.

The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus two, as the code does not modify it.
