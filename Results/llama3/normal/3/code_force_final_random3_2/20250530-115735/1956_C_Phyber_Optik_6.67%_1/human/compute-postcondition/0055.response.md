The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, i is n, j is n + r, n is an integer, r is 0, sum is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is n + r, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `sum` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
