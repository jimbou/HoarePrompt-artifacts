Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `2` is a literal integer value, so it will be printed as is.
* `j % n` is an expression that calculates the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Since `j` is larger than `n`, the remainder will be a value between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive). We can't determine the exact value without knowing the specific values of `j` and `n`, but we can describe it as "the remainder of `j` divided by `n`".
* `end=' '` is a keyword argument that specifies the separator between the values printed. In this case, it's a space character.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output the literal value 2, followed by a space, followed by the remainder of `j` divided by `n`.

Output: **2, the remainder of j divided by n (where j is larger than n and n is an integer greater than 0)**
