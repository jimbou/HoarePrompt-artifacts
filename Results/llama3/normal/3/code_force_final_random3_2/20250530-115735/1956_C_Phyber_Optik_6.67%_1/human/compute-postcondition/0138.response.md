To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(1, n + r + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `r` is at least 0.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

The state of `n` and `r` remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `r` must be at least 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. If `j` is larger than `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed.**
