According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`. If `n + r` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n + r` is `2n`, so `n` is at least 1 and `r` is at least 1. Also, `j` is now 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n + r` is `2n`, `r` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) * (n - r + 1) + (r - 1) * r * n // 2**
