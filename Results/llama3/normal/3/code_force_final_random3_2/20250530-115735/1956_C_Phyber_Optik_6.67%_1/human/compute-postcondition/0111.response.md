Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 1, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is 1, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` positive integers. The value of `r` has been set to `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
