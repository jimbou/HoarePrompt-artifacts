Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `r` must be at least 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. If `j` is larger than `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed, and this is printed: 2, the remainder of j divided by n which is 2**
