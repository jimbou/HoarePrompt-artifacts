Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is 2, j is n, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 2**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `t` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The value of `_` remains 2 as it is not used or modified by the code. The value of `i` remains 2 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `j` remains `n` as it is not modified by the code. The value of `sum` is now `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2` because the code adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the initial value of `sum`. The value of `r` is now 2 because the code assigns the value of `i` to `r`, and `i` is 2.
