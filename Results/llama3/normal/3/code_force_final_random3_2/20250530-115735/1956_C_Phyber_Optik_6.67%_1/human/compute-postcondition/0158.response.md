Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n + r`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `r` must be at least 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed, and the number 1 and the value of `j` which is `n + r` are printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed, and this is printed: `n + r`, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` which is `n + r`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of `n`, `t`, `_`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is now equal to `n + r`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive have been printed, and if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the number 1 and the value of `j` (which is `n + r`) have been printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed, and the value of `n + r` and the remainder of `j` divided by `n` (which is `n + r`) have been printed.
