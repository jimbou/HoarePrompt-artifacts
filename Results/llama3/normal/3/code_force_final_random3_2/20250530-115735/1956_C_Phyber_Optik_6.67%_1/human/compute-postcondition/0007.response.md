Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to the product of `i` and `n`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sum` has been updated to be the product of `i` and `n`, which is `i * n`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The condition that the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to the product of `i` and `n` is still valid.
