Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `j` is `n`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3*n`, or `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2*n + 3*n`, or `i*n + 2*n + 3*n`, `r` is either 2, or 1, or 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding the product of `i` and `n` to its previous value, which was determined by the conditions in the initial state. The value of `r` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
