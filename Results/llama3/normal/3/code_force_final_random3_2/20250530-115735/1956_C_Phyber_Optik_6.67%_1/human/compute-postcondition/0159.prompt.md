Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    sum, r = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
            r = i
            sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
        else:
            sum += i * n
    print(sum, n + r)
    for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
        if j <= n:
            print(1, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        else:
            print(2, j % n, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n + r` is `2n`, `r` is at least 1, `j` is `n + r`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1, n+r" is printed followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Otherwise, "2, r" is printed followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, i is n, n is at least 1, r is n, sum is either n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 or n * (n + 1) // 2, j is n + r, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If j is less than or equal to n, a sequence of numbers from 1 to n inclusive is printed. Otherwise, 2, the remainder of j divided by n, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n inclusive are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n + r`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `r` must be at least 0, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed, and the number 1 and the value of `j` which is `n + r` are printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed, and this is printed: `n + r`, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` which is `n + r`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
