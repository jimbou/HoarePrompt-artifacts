Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is `n`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` or `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive is printed. Otherwise, 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed. In both cases, 1, `j` (where `j` is `n+1`), and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed.**
