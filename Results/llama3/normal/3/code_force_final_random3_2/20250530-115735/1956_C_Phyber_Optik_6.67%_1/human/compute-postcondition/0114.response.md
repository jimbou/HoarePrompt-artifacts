Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i*n` and `r` is 0.***
