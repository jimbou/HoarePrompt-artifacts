Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) + 2 * (i * n)` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n` or `i * n + 3 * n`, and `r` is either 1 or 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding `i * n` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `sum` and `r` is still dependent on the comparison between `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n`.
