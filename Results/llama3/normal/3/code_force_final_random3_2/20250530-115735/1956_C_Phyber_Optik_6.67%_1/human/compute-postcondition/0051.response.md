Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n + r` is `2n`, `r` is at least 1, `j` is `n + 2`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1, n+2" is printed followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Otherwise, "2, 2" is printed followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).***
