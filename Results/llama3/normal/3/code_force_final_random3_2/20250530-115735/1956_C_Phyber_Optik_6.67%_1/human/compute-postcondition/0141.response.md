The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer greater than 0.

Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, the sequence will start from 1 and end at the value of `n`.

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than 0)**
