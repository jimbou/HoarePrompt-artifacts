Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is either `n` or `n + 1`, `r` is either 0 or 1, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `n + 2 * n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated based on the initial condition. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n`, otherwise, `sum` is `n + 2 * n`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `r` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` are also unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
