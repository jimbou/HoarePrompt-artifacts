To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects in it. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `t`. Since `_` is 0, it is already less than `t`. However, since `_` is a loop counter, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 1.

Since `t` is already at least 1, the state of `t` does not need to be adjusted.

The state of `_` needs to be adjusted to 1, since it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `r`, `j`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n + r` is `2n`, `r` is at least 1, `j` is `n + r`.**
