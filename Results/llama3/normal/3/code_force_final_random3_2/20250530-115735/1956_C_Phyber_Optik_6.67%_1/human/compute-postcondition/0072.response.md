To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `j` is the loop variable, and its initial value is 1. For the loop to execute, `j` should be within the range `[1, n + r]`. So, we need to ensure that `n + r` is at least 1.
2. `n` is an integer, and its value affects the range of the loop. For the loop to execute, `n` should be at least 1.
3. `r` is either `n` or 0, depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`. If `r` is 0, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `r` is `n`.

Considering these conditions, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `n` must be at least 1.
* `r` must be `n`.
* `j` is 1.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `i`, `sum`, and `stdin`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is `n`, `j` is 1, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` or `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two**
