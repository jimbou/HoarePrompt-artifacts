The only objects in the loop head are variables  j, n and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n` and `r`. If `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is at least 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n + r` is `2n`, `r` is at least 1, `j` is `n + 1**
