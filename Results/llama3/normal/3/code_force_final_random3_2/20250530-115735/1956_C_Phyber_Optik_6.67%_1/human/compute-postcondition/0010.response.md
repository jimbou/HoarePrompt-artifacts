Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is at least 2, sum is (n * (n + 1) // 2) + (i * n), r is 2, _ is 0, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `sum`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 2. The second line increments `sum` by the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2`, resulting in a new value for `sum` that is the sum of its original value (`i * n`) and the added value (`n * (n + 1) // 2`). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The state of stdin also remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus one.
