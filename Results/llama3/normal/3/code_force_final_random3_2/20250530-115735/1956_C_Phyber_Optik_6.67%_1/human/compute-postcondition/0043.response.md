The `print` statement will print the values of `1`, `j`, and an extra space due to the `end=' '` argument.

The value of `j` is `n + 2`, where `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is not explicitly defined, we can't determine its exact value. However, we know that `j` is `n + 2`, so it will be at least 3.

Output: **1, [n + 2] (where n is at least 1),**
