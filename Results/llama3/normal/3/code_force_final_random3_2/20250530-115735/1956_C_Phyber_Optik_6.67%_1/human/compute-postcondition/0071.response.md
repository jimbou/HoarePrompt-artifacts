The code prints the value of `sum` and the value of `n + r`. Based on the precondition, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` or `n * (n + 1) // 2`, depending on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`. Similarly, `r` is either `n` or `0`, depending on the same condition. Therefore, `n + r` is either `n + n` or `n + 0`, which simplifies to `2n` or `n`, respectively.

Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, i is n, j is n + r, n is an integer, r is n if n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n, otherwise r is 0, sum is n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 if n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n, otherwise sum is n * (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the sum which is either n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 or n * (n + 1) // 2 and n + r which is either 2n or n is being printed**
