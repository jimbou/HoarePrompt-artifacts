The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and `n` is still greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is 3, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the product of n and the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of i and n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 and r is 2. Otherwise, if the product of n and the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of i and n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2*n and r is 1. Otherwise, sum is i*n + 2*n and r is 0.**
