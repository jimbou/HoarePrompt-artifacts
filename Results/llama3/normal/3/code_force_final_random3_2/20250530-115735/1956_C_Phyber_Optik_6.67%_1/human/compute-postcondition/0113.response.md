Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is `i*n`, `r` is 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. The product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to the product of `i` and `n`**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to `i*n`, which is the product of the current value of `i` (1) and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 being less than or equal to the product of `i` and `n` is still valid.
