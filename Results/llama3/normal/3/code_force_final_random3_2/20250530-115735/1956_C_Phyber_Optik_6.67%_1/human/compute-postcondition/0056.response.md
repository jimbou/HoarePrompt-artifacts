Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + r`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `sum` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of `n` and `i` are such that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is greater than `i` times `n`.**
