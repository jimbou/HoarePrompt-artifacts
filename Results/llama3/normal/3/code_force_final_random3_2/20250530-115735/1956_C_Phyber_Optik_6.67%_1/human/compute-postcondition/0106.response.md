Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, i is n, n is at least 1, r is n, sum is either n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 or n * (n + 1) // 2, j is n + r, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If j is less than or equal to n, a sequence of numbers from 1 to n inclusive is printed. Otherwise, 2, the remainder of j divided by n, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n inclusive are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The loop has iterated over the range from 1 to n + r (inclusive), and for each iteration, it has printed a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) if j is less than or equal to n, or 2, the remainder of j divided by n, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) if j is greater than n. The values of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
