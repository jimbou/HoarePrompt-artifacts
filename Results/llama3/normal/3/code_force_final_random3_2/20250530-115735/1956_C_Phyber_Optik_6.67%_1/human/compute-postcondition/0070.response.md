Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, but its value is not used in the print statement.
* `_` is 1, but its value is not used in the print statement.
* `i` is equal to `n`.
* `j` is equal to `n + r`.
* `n` is an integer, but its exact value is not specified.
* `r` is equal to `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`, otherwise `r` is 0.
* `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`, otherwise `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(sum, n + r)`

The print statement will print two values: `sum` and `n + r`.

* `sum` will be printed as either `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` or `n * (n + 1) // 2`, depending on the value of `n`.
* `n + r` will be printed as either `n + n` or `n + 0`, depending on the value of `r`. If `r` is `n`, then `n + r` will be `2n`. If `r` is 0, then `n + r` will be `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `sum` and `n + r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum and the value of `n + r`.

Output: **sum (where sum is either n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 or n * (n + 1) // 2), n + r (where n + r is either 2n or n)**
