The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) + (i * n)` and `r` is 2. Otherwise, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `i * n + 2 * n`, and `r` is either 1 or 0.**
