The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is at least 2.

Since `n` is at least 2, the printed sequence will always start with 1 and end with a value greater than or equal to 2.

The exact sequence of numbers printed will depend on the value of `n`. For example, if `n` is 2, the output will be "1, 2". If `n` is 3, the output will be "1, 2, 3", and so on.

Output: **a sequence of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive), where n is at least 2**
