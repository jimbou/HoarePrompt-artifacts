Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is 2, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the product of n and the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of i and n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 and r is 2. Otherwise, if the product of n and the sum of n and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of i and n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2*n and r is 1. Otherwise, sum is i*n + 2*n and r is 0.***
