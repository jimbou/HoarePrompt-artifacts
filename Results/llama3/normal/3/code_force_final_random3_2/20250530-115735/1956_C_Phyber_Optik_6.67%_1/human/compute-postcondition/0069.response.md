Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, i is n, j is n + r, n is an integer, r is n if n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n, otherwise r is 0, sum is n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 if n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n, otherwise sum is n * (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `n + r`, `n` remains unchanged, `r` is equal to `n` if the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n` is true, otherwise `r` is 0, and `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` if the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n` is true, otherwise `sum` is equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus two.
