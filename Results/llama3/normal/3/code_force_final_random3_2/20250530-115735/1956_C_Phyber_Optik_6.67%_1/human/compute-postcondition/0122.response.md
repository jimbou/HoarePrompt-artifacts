Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is 3, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 or n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2*n or i*n + 2*n, and r is 3. Otherwise, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3*n, or n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2*n + 3*n, or i*n + 2*n + 3*n, and r is either 2, or 1, or 0.***
