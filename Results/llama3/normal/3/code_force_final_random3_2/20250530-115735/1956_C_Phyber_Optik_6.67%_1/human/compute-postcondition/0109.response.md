The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer, sum is 0, r is 0, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is n, j is n + r which is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**
