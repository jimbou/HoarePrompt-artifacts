Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `sum` and `r` depends on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` or not.***
