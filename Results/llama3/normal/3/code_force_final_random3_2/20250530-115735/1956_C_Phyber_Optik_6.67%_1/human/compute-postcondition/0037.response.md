Based on the given precondition, let's break down the print statement:

`print(2, j % n, end=' ')`

Here's what we know from the precondition:

* `j` is `n + 1`
* `n` is at least 1

So, when we calculate `j % n`, we get:

`j % n = (n + 1) % n`

Since `n` is at least 1, the remainder of `(n + 1)` divided by `n` will always be 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

`2, 1`

The `end=' '` argument means that a space will be printed after the output, instead of a newline.

Output: **2, 1**
