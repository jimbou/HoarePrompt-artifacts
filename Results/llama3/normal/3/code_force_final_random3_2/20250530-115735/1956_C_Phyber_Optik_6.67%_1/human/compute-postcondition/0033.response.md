Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `1` is a literal integer value that will be printed as is.
* `j` is a variable that is equal to `n + 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, `j` will be at least 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value 1, followed by the value of `j`, which is `n + 1`.

Output: **1, [n + 1] (where n is at least 1)**
