The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i*n` and `r` is 0.**
