The code prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using the `range` function. Since `n` is at least 1, the sequence will start from 1 and end at `n`. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function, which will then print each number in the sequence separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n, which is at least 1)**
