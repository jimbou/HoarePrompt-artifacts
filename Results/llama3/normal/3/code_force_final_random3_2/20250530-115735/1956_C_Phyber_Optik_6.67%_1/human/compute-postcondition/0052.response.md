Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n + r` is `2n`, `r` is at least 1, `j` is `n + r`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1, n+r" is printed followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Otherwise, "2, r" is printed followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute a total of `n + r` times. After the loop finishes executing, the value of `j` will be `n + r`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop will print "1, n+r" followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop will print "2, r" followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The values of `t`, `n`, `_`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged, and the condition `n + r` is `2n` still holds.
