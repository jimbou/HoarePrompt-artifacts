To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `r` must be at least 0.

According to the loop statement, `j` ranges from 1 to `n + r`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + r`.

Since `j` is currently 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. We also need to ensure that `n + r` is greater than 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `r` must be at least 1, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed, and the number 1 and the value of `j` which is 3 are printed. If `j` is larger than `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed, and this is printed: 3, the remainder of `j` divided by `n` which is 3, and the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are being printed.**
