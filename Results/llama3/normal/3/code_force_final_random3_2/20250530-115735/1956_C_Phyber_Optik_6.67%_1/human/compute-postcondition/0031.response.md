Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n + r` is `2n`, `r` is at least 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the numbers from 1 to `n` (where `n` is at least 1) are printed separated by spaces. If `j` is larger than `n`, the number 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, followed by a space, and the numbers from 1 to `n` are printed. In both cases, `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) * (n - r + 1) + (r - 1) * r * n // 2.***
