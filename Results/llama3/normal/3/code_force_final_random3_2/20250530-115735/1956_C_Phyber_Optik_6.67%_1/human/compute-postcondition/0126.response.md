The only objects in the loop head are variables  j, n and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable r. If r is at least 0 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer greater than 0, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is n, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * n and r is n. Otherwise, sum is n * (n + 1) * n // 2 and r is 0, and this is printed: the sum of the series and the sum of n and r. So for the loop to be executed  the variable r must be at least 0 and the variable j is 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is n, j is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, r must be at least 0**
