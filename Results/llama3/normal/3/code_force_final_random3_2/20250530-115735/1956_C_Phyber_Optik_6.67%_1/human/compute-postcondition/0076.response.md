The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is at least 1.

Since `n` is at least 1, the sequence will start with 1 and end with `n`. The `*` operator unpacks the range object into separate arguments to the `print` function, so each number in the sequence will be printed separated by a space.

Output: **1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is at least 1)**
