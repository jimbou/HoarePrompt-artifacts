To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
