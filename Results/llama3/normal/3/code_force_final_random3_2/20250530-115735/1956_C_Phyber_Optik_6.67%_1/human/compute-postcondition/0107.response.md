The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is n, `n` is at least 1, `r` is n, `sum` is either n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 or n * (n + 1) // 2, `j` is n + r, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
