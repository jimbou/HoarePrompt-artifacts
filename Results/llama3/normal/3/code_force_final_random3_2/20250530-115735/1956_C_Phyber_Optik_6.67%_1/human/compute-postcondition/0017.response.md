Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) * (n - r + 1) + (r - 1) * r * n // 2` and `r` is `n`. Otherwise, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`, and `r` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- The value of `n` is at least `n`, meaning it is the same as the initial value of `n`.
- The value of `_` remains unchanged, still 0.
- The value of `i` is now `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
- The value of `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing multiple test cases minus one.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then the value of `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` multiplied by the number of times the loop executed minus `r` plus 1, plus the sum of `r` minus 1 multiplied by `r` multiplied by `n` divided by 2. The value of `r` is `n`.
- Otherwise, the value of `sum` is the sum of `n` multiplied by `n + 1` multiplied by `n` divided by 2, and the value of `r` is 0.
