The code prints the value of `sum` and the value of `n + r`. Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of `sum` and `r` as follows:

* If `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) * (n - r + 1) + (r - 1) * r * n // 2` and `r` is `n`.
* Otherwise, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`, and `r` is 0.

Since `n` is at least `n`, we know that `n` is a non-negative integer. Additionally, since `i` is `n`, we can substitute `n` for `i` in the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`. This simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `n * n`, which is always true for non-negative integers `n`.

Therefore, we can conclude that `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) * (n - r + 1) + (r - 1) * r * n // 2` and `r` is `n`.

Now, let's consider the value of `n + r`. Since `r` is `n`, we have `n + r` = `n + n` = `2n`.

In summary, the code prints the value of `sum`, which is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) * (n - r + 1) + (r - 1) * r * n // 2`, and the value of `n + r`, which is `2n`.

Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the following is printed: `sum` is `(n * (n + 1) // 2) * (n - r + 1) + (r - 1) * r * n // 2` and `n + r` is `2n`**
