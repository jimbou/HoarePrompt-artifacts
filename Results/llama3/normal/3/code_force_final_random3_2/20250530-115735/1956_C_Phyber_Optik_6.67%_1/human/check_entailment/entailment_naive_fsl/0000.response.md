Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations. The program assumes that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers, but it does not consider the fact that the matrix is filled with permutations of numbers from 1 to n.

A counterexample is when n = 3. The program will output a sum of 12 and 4 operations, but the correct maximum sum is 15, which can be achieved with 3 operations:

Operation 1: Fill the first row with the permutation [3, 2, 1].
Operation 2: Fill the second row with the permutation [1, 3, 2].
Operation 3: Fill the third row with the permutation [2, 1, 3].

The program's output does not match the correct solution for this case, therefore it is incorrect.
