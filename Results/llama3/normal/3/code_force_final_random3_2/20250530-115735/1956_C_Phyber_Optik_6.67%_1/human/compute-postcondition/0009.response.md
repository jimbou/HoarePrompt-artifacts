The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `sum` and `r` depends on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` or not.**
