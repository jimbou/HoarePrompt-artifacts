Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, i is n, j is n + r, stdin contains no test cases, r is n, sum is either n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6 or n * (n + 1) // 2, and n is at least 1.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the loop variables have reached their final values. The loop counter `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, which is the last value it takes in the loop. The variable `j` has reached the value of `n + r`, which is the last value it takes in the loop. The input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `r` has reached the value of `n`, which is the last value it takes in the loop. The variable `sum` has reached one of its two possible final values, depending on the value of `n`. The variable `n` is at least 1, indicating that the loop has executed at least once.
