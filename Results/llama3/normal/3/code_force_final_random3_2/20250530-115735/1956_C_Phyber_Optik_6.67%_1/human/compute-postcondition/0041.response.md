Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n + r` is `2n`, `r` is at least 1, `j` is `n + 1`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then "1, [n + 1]" is printed, followed by a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Otherwise, "2 (j % n)" is printed, where `j % n` is the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are printed.***
