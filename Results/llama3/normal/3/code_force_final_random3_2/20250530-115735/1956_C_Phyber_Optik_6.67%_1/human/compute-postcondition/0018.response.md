Based on the initial state, let's break down the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The value of `sum` depends on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, this condition simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`, which is always false because `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `n * n` for all positive integers `n`. Therefore, the `sum` is calculated as `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`, and `r` is 0.

Now, let's analyze the print statement: `print(sum, n + r)`. The value of `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`, and the value of `n + r` is `n + 0`, which simplifies to just `n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * n // 2, n (where n is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive)**
