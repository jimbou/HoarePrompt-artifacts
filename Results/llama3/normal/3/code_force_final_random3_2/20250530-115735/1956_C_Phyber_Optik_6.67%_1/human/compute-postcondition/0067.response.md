Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, n is greater than 2, i is 3, j is either n or n + 1, r is either 0 or 1, sum is either n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n or n + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n or n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n + 3 * n or n + 2 * n + 3 * n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding `i * n` to its previous value. Since `i` is 3, the new value of `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n` or `n + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n` or `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n + 3 * n` or `n + 2 * n + 3 * n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
