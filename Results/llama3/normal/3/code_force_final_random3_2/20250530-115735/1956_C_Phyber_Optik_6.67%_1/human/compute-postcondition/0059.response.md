Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `sum` is `n`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to `n` because `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
