Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is at least 1, sum is equal to n * (n + 1) // 2, r is 1, _ is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The value of `r` has been set to `1`, which is the current value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
