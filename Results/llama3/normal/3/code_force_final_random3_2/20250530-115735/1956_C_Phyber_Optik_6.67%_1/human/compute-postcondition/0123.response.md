Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is n, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * n and r is n. Otherwise, sum is n * (n + 1) * n // 2 and r is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0.
*   The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive.
*   The value of `_` remains unchanged as 2.
*   The value of `i` is now equal to `n`.
*   The value of `j` is now equal to `n`.
*   The number of test cases in `stdin` remains unchanged as multiple test cases minus three.
*   The value of `sum` depends on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If this condition is true, then `sum` is the product of `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `n`, and `r` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `sum` is the product of `n * (n + 1) * n // 2` and `r` is 0.
