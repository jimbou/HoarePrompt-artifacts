The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, n and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n` and `r`. If `j` is less than `n + r + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is `n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` is `n + 2` and for the loop to execute again `n + r + 1` must be greater than `n + 2`. So `n + r` must be greater than `n + 1`. So `r` must be greater than 1. Since `r` is `n` so `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is `n`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` or `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `j` is `n + 2`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two.**
