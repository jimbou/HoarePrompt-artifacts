Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. The product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is less than or equal to the product of `i` and `n`***
