This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n representing the size of a matrix. It calculates a sum based on the value of n and prints the sum along with the value of n plus an additional calculated value r. The function then prints a series of lines representing a matrix, where the first n lines have a specific pattern and the remaining lines have a different pattern. The function repeats this process for each test case and consumes all input from standard input, leaving no test cases remaining.
