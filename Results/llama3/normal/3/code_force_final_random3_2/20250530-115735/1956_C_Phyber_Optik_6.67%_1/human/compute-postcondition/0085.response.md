To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + r + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is at least 1, and `r` is equal to `n`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n + 1`. The values of `n` and `r` remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is `n`, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6` or `n * (n + 1) // 2`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive is printed. Otherwise, 2, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive are printed.**
