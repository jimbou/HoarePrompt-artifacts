Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is at least 2, `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2 * n` or `i * n + 2 * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `sum` and `r` depends on whether `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` or not.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, between 1 and 500 inclusive. The value of `n` is still at least 2. The value of `sum` has been updated by adding `i * n` to its previous value, which was either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`. The value of `r` remains either 1 or 0, depending on the previous condition. The value of `_` is still 0. The value of `i` is still 2. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
