Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, i is 1, j is n + 1, n is greater than 0, r is 1, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `r` and `sum`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `r`, making `r` equal to 1. The second line calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` and adds it to the current value of `sum`, effectively updating `sum` to be the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The value of `j` is also updated to be `n + 1` since `r` is now 1. The remaining variables, `t`, `_`, `i`, and `n`, retain their original values, and the state of stdin remains unchanged.
