Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, _ is 1, i is n, j is n + r, n is an integer, r is 0, sum is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains the same. The value of `i` is now equal to the new value of `n`, which is an integer read from the input. The value of `j` is now equal to the new value of `n` plus `r`, where `r` is 0. The value of `n` is now an integer read from the input. The value of `r` is now 0, as assigned by the code. The value of `sum` is also 0, as assigned by the code. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, as one test case has been read and processed by the code.
