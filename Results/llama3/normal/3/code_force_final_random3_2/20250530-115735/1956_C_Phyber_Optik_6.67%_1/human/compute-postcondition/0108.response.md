Output State: **n is an integer, sum is 0, r is 0, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is n, j is n + r which is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was input from stdin. The values of `sum` and `r` are both 0, as assigned by the code. The values of `t`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The value of `j` is now `n`, since `r` is 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three, since two more inputs were read.
