Output: **n is an integer greater than 0, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is n, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If n * (n + 1) // 2 is greater than i * n, then sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 * n and r is n. Otherwise, sum is n * (n + 1) * n // 2 and r is 0, and this is printed: the sum of the series and the sum of n and r**
