Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2*n` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `i*n + 2*n` and `r` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sum` has been updated by adding `i*n` to its previous value. The value of `i` is 2, so `i*n` is `2*n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that determines the value of `sum` and `r` is still based on the comparison between the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2, and the product of `i` and `n`.
