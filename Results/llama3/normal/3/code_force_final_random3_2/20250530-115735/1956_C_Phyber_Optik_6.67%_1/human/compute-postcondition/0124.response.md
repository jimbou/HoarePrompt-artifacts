The code prints the value of `sum` and the sum of `n` and `r`. The value of `sum` depends on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If this condition is true, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 * n` and `r` is `n`. Otherwise, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2` and `r` is `0`.

Since `n` is an integer greater than `0`, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `n`, the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n * n`, which is equivalent to `n + 1 > 2 * n`. This condition is only true when `n` is `1`.

Therefore, if `n` is `1`, then `sum` is `1 * (1 + 1) // 2 * 1 = 1` and `r` is `1`. If `n` is greater than `1`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2` and `r` is `0`.

Output: **1, 2 (if n is 1) or n * (n + 1) * n // 2, n (if n is greater than 1)**
