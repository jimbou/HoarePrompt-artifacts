The `print` statement will print three values: `2`, the remainder of `j` divided by `n`, and an empty space due to the `end=' '` argument.

Here's a breakdown of the values:

*   `2` is a literal integer value.
*   `j % n` is the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. Since `j` is larger than `n`, this will be a value between `0` and `n-1`, inclusive.
*   `end=' '` is an argument that specifies the ending character of the print statement. In this case, it's a single space.

Output: **2, the remainder of j divided by n, (where j is larger than n and n is at least 1),**
