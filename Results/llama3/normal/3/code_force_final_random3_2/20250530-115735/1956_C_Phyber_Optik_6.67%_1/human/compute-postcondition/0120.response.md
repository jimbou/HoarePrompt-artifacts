Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, t is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive, _ is 2, i is 3, j is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, r is 3, sum is n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2 or n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2*n or i*n + 2*n**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to 3, which is the initial value of `i`. The value of `sum` has been updated based on the initial conditions. If the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, if the product of `n` and the sum of `n` and 1 divided by 2 is greater than the product of `i` and `n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + 2*n`. Otherwise, `sum` is `i*n + 2*n`. The values of `n`, `t`, `_`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
