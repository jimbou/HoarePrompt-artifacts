Output State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m (3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)) followed by m lines, each containing three integers u, v, and w (1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, 1 <= w <= 10^6), and the recursion limit is set to 10^6.**

The code sets the recursion limit to 10^6 using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`, but it does not affect the input state. The input state remains the same, with stdin containing an integer t followed by t test cases, each containing two integers n and m, and m lines with three integers u, v, and w. The recursion limit is updated to 10^6, which allows for deeper recursion in the program.
