Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 0 and 48, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `t` is still an integer between 0 and 48, and the value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50. The new variable `s` is assigned a string value that consists of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines, each containing an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 50.
