Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 49, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50), `t` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 50, but since one line has been read from the input, the number of remaining lines in stdin is now `t-1`. The value of `_` remains 0. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 50, which is the value read from the first line of the input. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
