Output: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 49, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50). The current value of `s` has a length less than 200, 'YES' is being printed, and the string `s` which is '110' repeated `n // 2` times is being printed**
