Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 49, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50). If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
