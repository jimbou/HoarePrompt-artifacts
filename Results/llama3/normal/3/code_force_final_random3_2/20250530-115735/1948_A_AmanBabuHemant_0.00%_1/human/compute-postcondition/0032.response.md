Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 0 and 48, n is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of n has been updated to the integer value read from the input, which is between 1 and 50. The values of _ and t remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing an integer n, since one line has been read and processed.
