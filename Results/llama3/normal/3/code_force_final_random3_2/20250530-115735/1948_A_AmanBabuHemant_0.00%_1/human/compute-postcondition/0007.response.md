Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 49, `_` is 0, `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50, `s` is a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `s` is a string that consists of the substring '110' repeated `n // 2` times, where `n` is an even integer between 1 and 50. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 49, and `_` still being 0. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines, each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50.
