Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 50. The remaining inputs in stdin are still present, each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50, and there are `t` such lines.
