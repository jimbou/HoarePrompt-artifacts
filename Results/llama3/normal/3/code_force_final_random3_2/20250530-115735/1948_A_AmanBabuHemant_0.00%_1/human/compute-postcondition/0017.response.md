Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 49, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50), `t` must be greater than 0. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, a string `s` of '110' repeated `n // 2` times is created. If the length of `s` is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string `s` is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
