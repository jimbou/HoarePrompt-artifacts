Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer between 0 and 48, n is an integer between 1 and 50, s is a string of '110' repeated n//2 times, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `t` is still an integer between 0 and 48. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50. The new variable `s` is assigned a string value that consists of '110' repeated `n//2` times. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines, each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50.
