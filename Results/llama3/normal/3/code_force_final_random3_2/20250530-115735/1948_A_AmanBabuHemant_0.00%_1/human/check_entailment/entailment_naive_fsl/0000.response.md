Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The problem description requires the output string to consist of uppercase Latin letters, but the program generates a string of '1's and '0's. This does not meet the requirements of the problem.

For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs "YES" and "110110", which does not consist of uppercase Latin letters.
