Output State: **_ is t, t is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains 0 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If n is odd, 'NO' is printed. If n is even, a string s of '110' repeated n // 2 times is created. If the length of s is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string s is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, `t` will be 0, and `n` will be the last integer read from stdin. The stdin will be empty, and the loop will have printed 'NO' for odd values of `n` and 'YES' followed by the string `s` for even values of `n` where the length of `s` is less than 200.
