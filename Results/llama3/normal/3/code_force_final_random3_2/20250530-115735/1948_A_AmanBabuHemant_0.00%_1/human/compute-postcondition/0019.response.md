Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 0 and 48, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `t` is still an integer between 0 and 48, but since one line has been read from stdin, the number of lines remaining in stdin is now `t-1`. The value of `n` has been updated to the integer value read from the first line of stdin, which is between 1 and 50.
