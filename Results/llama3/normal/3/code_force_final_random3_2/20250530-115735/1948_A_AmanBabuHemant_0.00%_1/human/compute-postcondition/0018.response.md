The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 49, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 0 and 48, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` lines each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50)**
