This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the size of a string to be generated. For each even n, it generates a string s consisting of '110' repeated n // 2 times and prints 'YES' followed by the string if its length is less than 200. If n is odd or the length of s is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
