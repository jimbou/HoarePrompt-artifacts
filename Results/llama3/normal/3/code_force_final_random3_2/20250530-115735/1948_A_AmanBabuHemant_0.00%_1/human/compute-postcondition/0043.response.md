Postcondition: ***_ is 2, t is an integer between 0 and 48, n is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If n is odd, 'NO' is printed. If n is even, a string s is created by repeating '110' n//2 times. If the length of s is less than 200, 'YES' is printed and the string s is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
