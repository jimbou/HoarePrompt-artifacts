Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `n` is greater than `j`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `s`, `n`, `j`, and `k` are still valid. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each with the specified properties.
