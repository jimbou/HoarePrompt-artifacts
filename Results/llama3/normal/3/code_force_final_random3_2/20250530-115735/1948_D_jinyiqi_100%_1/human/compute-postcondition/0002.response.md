Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`**

In this output state, a new variable `count` has been introduced and initialized to 0. The values of the other variables, `s`, `n`, and `j`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000.
