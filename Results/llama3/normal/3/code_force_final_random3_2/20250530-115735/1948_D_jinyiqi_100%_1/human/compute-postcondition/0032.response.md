Output State: **`count` is 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is '?', then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1, and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal and are not '?'**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If `count` was initially 0, it is now 1. If `count` was initially 1, it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that determines the value of `count` is still based on the comparison of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`, but now `count` is 2 if they are equal or either of them is '?', and 1 otherwise.
