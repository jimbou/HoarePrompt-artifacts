Postcondition: ***`count` is 0 or 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is '?', then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal and are not '?'***
