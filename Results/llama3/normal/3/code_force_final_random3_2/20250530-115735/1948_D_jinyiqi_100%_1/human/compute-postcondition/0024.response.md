Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 1)`**

The value of `count` is reassigned to 0, overwriting its initial value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The value of `n` is still at least 2, and the values of `j` and `k` are still calculated based on `n`.
