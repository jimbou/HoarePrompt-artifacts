Output State: **`count` is 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0. The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'**

The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The value of `n` is still at least 2, and `j` is still `n // 2 - 1`. The value of `k` is still 0. The current value of `s[k]` is still either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'.
