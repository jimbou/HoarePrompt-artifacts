Reasoning:

1. The problem asks to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

2. The given program defines a function `func_1()` that takes a string `s` as input and calculates the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat.

3. The function iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for each possible length of the tandem repeat (from `n // 2` to `1`).

4. For each possible length `j`, it checks if the substring of length `j` starting at index `k` is equal to the substring of length `j` starting at index `k + j`. If they are equal or if either of them contains a question mark, it increments the count.

5. If the count equals `j`, it means that a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, so it prints `2 * j` and returns.

6. If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, it prints `0`.

7. The program calls `func_1()` for each test case.

8. The time complexity of the program is O(n^2) where n is the length of the string, which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

9. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the input string.

10. The program correctly handles the case where the input string does not contain any tandem repeats by printing `0`.

Correctness: **True**
