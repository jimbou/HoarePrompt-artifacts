Output State: **`count` is 0 or a multiple of `j`, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 1)`. If the loop finishes without printing, then `count` is 0. Otherwise, `count` is a multiple of `j` and the loop prints `count * 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

- The value of `count` is either 0 or a multiple of `j` (which is `n // 2 - 1`).
- The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing `t-1` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000.
- The state of `s` remains unchanged, being a list of characters from the first string.
- The state of `n` remains unchanged, being at least 2.
- The state of `j` remains unchanged, being `n // 2 - 1`.
- The state of `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 1)`, which is the last value it takes after the loop finishes.

If the loop finishes without printing, it means that the condition `count == j` was never met, so `count` remains 0. Otherwise, `count` is a multiple of `j` and the loop prints `count * 2`.
