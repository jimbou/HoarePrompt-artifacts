The code prints the value of `count` multiplied by 2.
Since `count` is equal to `j` and `j` is `n // 2`, the printed value will be `n`.
Output: **`count` is 0 or 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, or either `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0. The current value of `count` is equal to `j`, and the value of `n` is being printed**
