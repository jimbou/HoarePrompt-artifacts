Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates over all possible lengths of the tandem repeat from the longest to the shortest, and for each length, it checks all possible substrings of that length. If it finds a substring that is a tandem repeat, it prints the length of that substring and returns.

The program also correctly handles the case where it is impossible to make any tandem repeat substrings in the string, in which case it prints 0.

I have checked the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I have also tried to think of potential edge cases that the program might not handle correctly, but I have not been able to find any.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
