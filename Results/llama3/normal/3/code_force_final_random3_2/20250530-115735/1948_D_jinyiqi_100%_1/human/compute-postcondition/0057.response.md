Output State: **count is 0 or a multiple of j, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, s is a list of characters from the first string, n is at least 2, j is 1, k is n - 1. If the loop finishes without printing, then count is 0. Otherwise, count is a multiple of j and the loop prints count * 2.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `count` will either be 0 (if the loop didn't find any matching pairs of characters) or a multiple of `j` (if the loop found a pair of matching characters). The state of the other variables (`stdin`, `s`, `n`) remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The loop will either finish without printing anything (if `count` is 0) or print the value of `count * 2` (if `count` is a multiple of `j`).
