The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be `n // 2 - 2`.
State: **`count` is 0 or a multiple of `j`, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`**
