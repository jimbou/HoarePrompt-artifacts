The only variables in the loop head are variables  k, n and j, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `n` and `j`. If `k` is less than `n - j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 1 so `k` is `n // 2` and for the loop to execute again `n - j` must be greater than `n // 2`. Since `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n - j` is `n // 2 + 1` which is greater than `n // 2`. So `n` can be any value that is at least 2 and `j` can be any value that is `n // 2 - 1`.
State: **`count` is 0, 1, or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n // 2`**
