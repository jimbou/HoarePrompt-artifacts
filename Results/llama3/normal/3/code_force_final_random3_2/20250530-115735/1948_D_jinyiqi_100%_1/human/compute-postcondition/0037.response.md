Output State: **`count` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n // 2`, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each with the specified characteristics. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are still related by the expressions `j = n // 2 - 1` and `k = n // 2`, and `s` is still a list of characters from the first string.
