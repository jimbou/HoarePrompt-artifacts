The only variable in the loop head is variable  k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than `n - j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is some value, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1.
State: **`count` is 0 or 1, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is increased by 1**
