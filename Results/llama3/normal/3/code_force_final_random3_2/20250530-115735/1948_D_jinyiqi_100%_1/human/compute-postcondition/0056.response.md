Output State: **`count` is 0 or a multiple of `j`, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the count is either 0 or a multiple of `j`, and the other variables remain unchanged. The loop will continue to execute until the count is equal to `j`, at which point it will print the count multiplied by 2 and return. If the count never reaches `j`, the loop will execute until `k` reaches `n - j`, at which point it will terminate.
