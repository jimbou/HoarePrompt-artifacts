Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, 1, or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is increased by 1. If `s[k]` or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
