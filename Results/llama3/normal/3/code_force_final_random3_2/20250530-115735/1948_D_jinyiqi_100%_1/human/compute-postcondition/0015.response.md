Output State: **`count` is 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The value of `n` is still greater than 2, and `j` is still equal to `n // 2`. The value of `k` has been increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified.
