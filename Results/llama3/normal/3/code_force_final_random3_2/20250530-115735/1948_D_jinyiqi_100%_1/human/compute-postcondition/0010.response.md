Based on the initial state, we know that `count` is either 0 or 1, and its current value is equal to `j`. Since `j` is `n // 2` and `n` is greater than 2, `j` must be at least 1. Therefore, `count` is 1.

The `print` statement multiplies `count` by 2, so the output will be 2 times the value of `count`, which is 1.

Output: **2**
