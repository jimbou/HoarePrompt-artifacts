Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0, `n` is greater than `j`. `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`**

The code does not change the value of any variable, so the output state remains the same as the initial state. The value of `count` is still 0, and all other variables retain their initial values and properties.
