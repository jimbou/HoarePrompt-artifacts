To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k`, `n`, and `j`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `n - j` is greater than 0, because the range function will generate at least one value.
2. Since `n` is at least 2, we know that `n - j` will be greater than 0 if `j` is less than `n`.
3. Since `j` is `n // 2`, we know that `j` is less than or equal to `n / 2`.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 2, so that `n - j` is greater than 0.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0**
