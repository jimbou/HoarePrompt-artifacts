Output State: **`count` is 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `n` is greater than `j`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1, `s[k]` is not equal to '?' and not equal to `s[k + j]`, and `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?'**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If `count` was initially 0, it is now 1. If `count` was initially 1, it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions related to `s[k]`, `s[k + j]`, and `count` are still valid, but the value of `count` has been updated.
