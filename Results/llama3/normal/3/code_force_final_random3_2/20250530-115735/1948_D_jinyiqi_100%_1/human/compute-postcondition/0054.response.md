Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `n` is greater than `j`, `n - j` is greater than `k`**

The value of `count` is reset to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. The list `s` still contains characters from the first string. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` remain the same, with `n` being at least 2, `j` being `n // 2 - 2`, and `k` being `n - j`. The relationships between `n`, `j`, and `k` also remain the same, with `n` being greater than `j` and `n - j` being greater than `k`.
