Output State: **`count` is 0, stdin contains t-1 strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `s` is a list of characters from the first string, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, regardless of its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged, with `stdin` still containing t-1 strings, `s` still being a list of characters from the first string, `n` still being at least 2, `j` still being `n // 2 - 2`, and `k` still being `n - (n // 2 - 2)`.
