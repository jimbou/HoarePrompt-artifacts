Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), m is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), k is an even integer between 2 and 2*min(n, m) (inclusive), a is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), b is a list of m integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), len_a is equal to n, len_b is equal to m, count_a is 0, count_b is 0, d is equal to k divided by 2, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1 as one test case is processed. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned from the input and are within their respective ranges. The lists `a` and `b` are populated with `n` and `m` integers, respectively, within the range of 1 to 10^6. The variables `len_a` and `len_b` are set to the lengths of lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The variables `count_a` and `count_b` are initialized to 0. The variable `d` is calculated as half of `k`. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.
