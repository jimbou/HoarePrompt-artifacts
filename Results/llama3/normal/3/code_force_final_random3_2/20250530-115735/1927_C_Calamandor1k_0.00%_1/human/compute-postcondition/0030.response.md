The code prints 'YES' if the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` is at least `k` divided by 2 and the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is at least `k` divided by 2, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Where `k` is an even integer between 2 and 2*min(n, m) (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `len_a` is equal to `n` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is equal to `m` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `d` is equal to `k` divided by 2, `_` is 0, `i` is equal to max(len_a, len_b), and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an even integer between 2 and 2*min(n, m) (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `len_a` is equal to `n` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is equal to `m` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `d` is equal to `k` divided by 2, `_` is 0, `i` is equal to max(len_a, len_b), and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`**
