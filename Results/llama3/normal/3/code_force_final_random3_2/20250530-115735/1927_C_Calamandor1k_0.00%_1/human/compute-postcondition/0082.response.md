Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `len_a` is equal to `n`, `len_b` is equal to `m`, `d` is equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is greater than 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `count_a` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `d`, `t`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `count_a` is incremented by 1.
