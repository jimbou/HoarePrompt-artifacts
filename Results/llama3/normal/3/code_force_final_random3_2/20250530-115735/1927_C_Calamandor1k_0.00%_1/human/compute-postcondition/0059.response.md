The code prints 'YES' if both count_a and count_b are greater than or equal to d, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Where count_a is the number of elements in list a that are less than or equal to k, count_b is the number of elements in list b that are less than or equal to k, and d is a certain value.

Output: **YES if both count_a and count_b are greater than or equal to d, otherwise NO**
