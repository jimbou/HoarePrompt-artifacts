Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `len_a` is equal to `n`, `len_b` is equal to `m`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is greater than 1, `count_a` is the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `count_b` is the number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 1, and `i` is 0. The current value of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`.**
