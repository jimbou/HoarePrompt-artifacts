Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether two lists of integers have at least a certain number of elements less than or equal to a given threshold. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, and two lists of integers a and b. The function then counts the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k and prints 'YES' if both counts are greater than or equal to k/2, and 'NO' otherwise.**
