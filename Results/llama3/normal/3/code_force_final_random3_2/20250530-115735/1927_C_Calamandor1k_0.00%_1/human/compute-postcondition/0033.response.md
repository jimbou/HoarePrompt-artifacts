To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `max(len_a, len_b)`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `max(len_a, len_b)`. If `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `len_a` and `len_b` are both at least 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` will always be at least 1.

However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it is within the range of `max(len_a, len_b)`. Since `i` is equal to `max(len_a, len_b)`, we can adjust its state to be within the range of `max(len_a, len_b)`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an even integer between 2 and 2*min(n, m) (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `len_a` is equal to `n` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is equal to `m` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is equal to `k` divided by 2, `_` is 1, `i` is within the range of `max(len_a, len_b)`**

Note that we didn't adjust the states of `len_a` and `len_b` because they are already guaranteed to be at least 1.
