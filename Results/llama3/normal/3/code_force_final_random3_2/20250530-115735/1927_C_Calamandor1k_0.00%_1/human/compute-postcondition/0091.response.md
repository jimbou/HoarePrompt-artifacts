Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` is empty, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `len_a` is equal to `n`, `len_b` is equal to `m`, `d` is equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, `count_a` is the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `count_b` is the number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the input `t` has been fully processed, and the input stream `stdin` is empty. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `d`, `count_a`, and `count_b` retain their last values after the loop finishes executing. The loop has printed either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, depending on whether the number of elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` are greater than or equal to `d`.
