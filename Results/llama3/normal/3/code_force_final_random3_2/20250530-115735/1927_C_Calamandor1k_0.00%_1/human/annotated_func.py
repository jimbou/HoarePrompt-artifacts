#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` is empty, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `len_a` is equal to `n`, `len_b` is equal to `m`, `d` is equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, `count_a` is the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `count_b` is the number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether two lists of integers have at least a certain number of elements less than or equal to a given threshold. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, and two lists of integers a and b. The function then counts the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k and prints 'YES' if both counts are greater than or equal to k/2, and 'NO' otherwise.
