The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases, after reading the integer `t`, the standard input will contain `t` test cases.

Each test case contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and `m` integers `b_1`, `b_2`, ..., `b_m` (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).

So, after reading the integer `t`, the standard input will contain `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` and `m` integers `b_1`, `b_2`, ..., `b_m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and `m` integers `b_1`, `b_2`, ..., `b_m` (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).**
