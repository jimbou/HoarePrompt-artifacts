Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an even integer between 2 and 2*min(n, m) (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `len_a` is equal to `n` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is equal to `m` and must be at least 1, `d` is equal to `k` divided by 2, `_` is 0, `i` is 2. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, then `count_a` is 3 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` is 2. Otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, then `count_b` is 2 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_b` is 1. Otherwise, `count_b` remains unchanged.**
