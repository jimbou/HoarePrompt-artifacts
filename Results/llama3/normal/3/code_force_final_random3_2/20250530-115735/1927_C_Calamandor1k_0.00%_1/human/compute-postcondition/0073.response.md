Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `len_a` is equal to `n`, `len_b` is equal to `m`, `d` is equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is greater than 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 1, and `i` is 0. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is the number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k` plus 1. Additionally, if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k` plus 1, otherwise `count_a` remains the same. If `len_b` is not greater than `i + 1`, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k` plus 1, otherwise `count_a` remains the same. `count_b` is the number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.***
