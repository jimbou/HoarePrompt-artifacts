To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `len_a`, and `len_b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 2.

To adjust the state, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The values of `len_a` and `len_b` remain unchanged, as they are not modified in the loop body.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `len_a` is equal to `n`, `len_b` is equal to `m`, `d` is equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is greater than 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 2, and `i` is 2**
