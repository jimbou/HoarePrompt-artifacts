Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `len_a` is equal to `n`, `len_b` is equal to `m`, `d` is equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, `t` is greater than 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_b` is the number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k` plus 1. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k` plus 2 if `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, or the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k` plus 1 otherwise. If `a[i]` is greater than `k`, then `count_a` is the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k`. If `b[i]` is greater than `k`, then `count_b` is the number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.**
