Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included. The program reads the input correctly, processes the test cases correctly, and prints the correct output based on the conditions.

However, there are a few minor issues with the program. The variable names could be more descriptive, and the comments could be more detailed. Additionally, the program does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases. But overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
