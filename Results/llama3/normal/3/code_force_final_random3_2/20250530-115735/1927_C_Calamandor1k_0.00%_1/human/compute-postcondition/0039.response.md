Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an even integer between 2 and 2*min(n, m) (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `len_a` is equal to `n` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is equal to `m` and must be at least 1, `i` is within the range of `max(len_a, len_b)`. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, then if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 0. Otherwise, `count_a` and `count_b` remain unchanged. The current value of `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`.***
