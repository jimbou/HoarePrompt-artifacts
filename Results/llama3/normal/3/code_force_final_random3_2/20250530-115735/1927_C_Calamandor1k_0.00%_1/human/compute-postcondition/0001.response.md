To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), we can confirm that `t` is indeed greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its state doesn't affect the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and `m` integers `b_1`, `b_2`, ..., `b_m` (1 <= b_j <= 10^6), `_` is 0**
