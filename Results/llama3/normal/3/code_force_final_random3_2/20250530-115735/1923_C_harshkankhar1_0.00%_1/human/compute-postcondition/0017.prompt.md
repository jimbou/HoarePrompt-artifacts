Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index `i`, `b` is a list of integers with a length equal to `n+1` where `b[i]` is `b[i-1]` plus 1 if the original `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i-1]` plus 2 for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the list `a` is being printed
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers where a[i] is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index i, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if the original a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is an integer, y is an integer, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers where a[i] is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index i, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if the original a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, x is an integer, y is an integer, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers where a[i] is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index i, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if the original a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, x is an integer, y is an integer, _ is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
