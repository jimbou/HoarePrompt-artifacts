Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer, a is a list of positive integers with a length equal to n+1, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of n remains unchanged, q remains unchanged, the list a remains unchanged, the list b has been updated such that for each index i from 1 to n, the value of b[i] is the sum of the value of b[i-1] and 1 if a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise it is the sum of the value of b[i-1] and 2. The loop counter i has reached the value of n. The state of the input stream stdin remains unchanged.
