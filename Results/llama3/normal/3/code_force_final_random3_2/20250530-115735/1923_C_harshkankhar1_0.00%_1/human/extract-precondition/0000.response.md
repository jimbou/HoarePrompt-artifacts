Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The second integer in each test case is the number of queries. The list of integers in each test case is a list of positive integers. The two integers in each query are positive integers such that the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.**
