Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of positive integers with a length equal to n+1, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[1] is 2 if a[1] is greater than 1, otherwise b[1] is 3, b[2] is b[1] plus 1 if a[2] is greater than 1, otherwise b[2] is b[1] plus 2, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `q` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The list `a` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The list `b` is modified at index `i` (which is 2), where its value is updated based on the value of `a` at index `i`. If `a[2]` is greater than 1, `b[2]` becomes `b[1] + 1`, otherwise it becomes `b[1] + 2`. The value of `i` remains 2 as it is not modified by the code. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one as one test case has been processed.
