This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of positive integers, and multiple queries. It calculates the cumulative sum of the list of integers and then answers each query by comparing the sum of the integers in the range specified by the query with a calculated value based on the original list. The function prints the cumulative sum of the original list and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the comparison result.
