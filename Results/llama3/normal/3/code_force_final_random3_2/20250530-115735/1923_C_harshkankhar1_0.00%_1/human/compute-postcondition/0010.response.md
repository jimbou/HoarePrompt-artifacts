Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index `i`, `b` is a list of integers with a length equal to `n+1` where `b[i]` is `b[i-1]` plus 1 if the original `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `b[i]` is `b[i-1]` plus 2 for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the list `a` is being printed**
