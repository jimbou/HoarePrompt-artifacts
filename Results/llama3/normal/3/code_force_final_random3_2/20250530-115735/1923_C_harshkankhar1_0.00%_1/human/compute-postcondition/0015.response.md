The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `_` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `q` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers where a[i] is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index i, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if the original a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, x is an integer, y is an integer, _ is 2**
