Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, a is a list of positive integers with a length equal to n+1, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[1] is 2 if a[1] is greater than 1, otherwise b[1] is 3, b[2] is b[1] plus 1 if a[2] is greater than 1, otherwise b[2] is b[1] plus 2, b[3] is b[2] plus 1 if a[3] is greater than 1, otherwise b[3] is b[2] plus 2, i is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `b[3]` has been updated based on the value of `a[3]`. If `a[3]` is greater than 1, `b[3]` is `b[2]` plus 1; otherwise, `b[3]` is `b[2]` plus 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
