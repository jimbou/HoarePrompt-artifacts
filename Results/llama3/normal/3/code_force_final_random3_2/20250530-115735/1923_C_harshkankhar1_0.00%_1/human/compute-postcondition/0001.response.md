To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of positive integers with a length equal to `n+1`, `b` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n+1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
