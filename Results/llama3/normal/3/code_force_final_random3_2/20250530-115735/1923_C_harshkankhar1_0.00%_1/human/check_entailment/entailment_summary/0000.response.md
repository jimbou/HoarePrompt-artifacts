Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given subarray is "good" based on certain conditions. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the input array and then uses this cumulative sum to answer queries about the subarrays.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` is not defined correctly. It seems like it's supposed to be a main function, but it's not defined as such. It should be defined as `def main():` instead of `def func_1():`.

2. The program prints the cumulative sum of the input array, which is not necessary for the problem. It should only print the results of the queries.

3. The condition for checking if a subarray is "good" is incorrect. The program checks if the sum of the subarray is less than the calculated value based on the original list, but it should check if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to the calculated value.

4. The program does not handle the case where the subarray has only one element correctly. It should print 'NO' for this case, but the program prints 'YES'.

5. The program does not handle the case where the sum of the subarray is equal to the calculated value based on the original list correctly. It should print 'YES' for this case, but the program prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **False**
