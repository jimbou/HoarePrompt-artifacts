Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers where a[i] is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index i, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if the original a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is an integer, y is an integer, _ is 0**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to x and y. It then prints 'YES' if the difference between the sum of integers in list a from index x-1 to y is greater than or equal to the difference between the corresponding elements in list b, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The values of n, q, a, b, i, and _ remain unchanged. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that one test case has been processed.
