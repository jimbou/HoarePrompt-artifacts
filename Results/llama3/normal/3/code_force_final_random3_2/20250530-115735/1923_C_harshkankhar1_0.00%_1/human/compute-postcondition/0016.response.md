Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers where a[i] is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index i, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if the original a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, x is an integer, y is an integer, _ is 2**

The code snippet reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `x` and `y`, and then prints 'YES' if the difference between `a[y]` and `a[x - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `b[y]` and `b[x - 1]`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only changes are that `x` and `y` are assigned new values, and one less test case is left in the input.
