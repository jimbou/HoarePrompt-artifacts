#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The second integer in each test case is the number of queries. The list of integers in each test case is a list of positive integers. The two integers in each query are positive integers such that the first integer is less than or equal to the second integer and the second integer is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer, a is a list of positive integers with a length equal to n+1, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: cumulative sum of the original list up to each index i (where i ranges from 0 to n)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers where a[i] is the sum of all integers in the original list up to index i, b is a list of integers with a length equal to n+1 where b[i] is b[i-1] plus 1 if the original a[i] is greater than 1, otherwise b[i] is b[i-1] plus 2 for all i from 1 to n, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus q, x is an integer, y is an integer, _ is q-1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of positive integers, and multiple queries. It calculates the cumulative sum of the list of integers and then answers each query by comparing the sum of the integers in the range specified by the query with a calculated value based on the original list. The function prints the cumulative sum of the original list and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the comparison result.
