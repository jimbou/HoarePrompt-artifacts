The code prints the elements of the list `a` which contains the cumulative sum of the original list up to each index `i`. The exact values of the elements in the list `a` depend on the original list, which is not provided. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the cumulative sum of the original list up to each index `i`.

Output: **cumulative sum of the original list up to each index i (where i ranges from 0 to n)**
