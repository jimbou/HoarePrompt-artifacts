Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `no_path` is False, and the value of `k` which is 1 is being printed. The current value of `a` at index `k` is not '>'**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been updated to False, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still being printed, and the condition that the current value of `a` at index `k` is not '>' remains valid.
