Output: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd. The current value of `no_path` is True, which means that for all `k` in range(1, n - 1, 2), the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', and 'YES' is printed**
