Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `no_path` is True and all characters at odd indexes of string `a` are '>', then `k` is `n` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd, and 'YES' is printed. If `no_path` is False or at least one character at an odd index of string `a` is not '>', then `k` is `n-1` if `n` is even and `n-2` if `n` is odd, and 'NO' is printed.***
