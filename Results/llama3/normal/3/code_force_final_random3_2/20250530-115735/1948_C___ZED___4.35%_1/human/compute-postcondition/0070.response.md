Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is `n` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The current value of `no_path` is False, indicating that at least one character at an even index of `b` is not '>'.**
