Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd, and `no_path` is True.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
    print(k)
    if a[k] != '>':
        no_path = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 1, and 1 is printed. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 0, `n` is at least 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 3, and 1 is printed. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True, and the value of `k` which is 3 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 0, `n` is at least 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 5, and 1 is printed. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True, and the value of `k` which is 5 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
