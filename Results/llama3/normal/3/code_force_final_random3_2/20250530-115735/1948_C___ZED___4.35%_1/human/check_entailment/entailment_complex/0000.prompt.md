Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    >>><
    
    >><<
    
    6
    
    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), then two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: i is equal to the number of test cases, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, stdin is empty. If b[-2] is not '>', 'NO' is printed for each test case where this condition is true. If b[-2] is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed for each test case where this condition is true. If n is not 1, then the values of k which are all odd numbers from 1 to n - 1 have been printed for each test case where this condition is true, and if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed for each test case where this condition is true, otherwise 'NO' is printed for each test case where this condition is true.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an even integer n and two strings a and b of length n, containing '<' and '>' characters. The function checks if a path exists between the strings based on certain conditions. If the second last character of string b is not '>', it prints 'NO' for that test case. If n is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if all characters at even indices in string b are '>' and all characters at odd indices in string a are '>'. If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. Additionally, for test cases where n is not 1 and the second last character of string b is '>', it prints the odd indices from 1 to n-1. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
