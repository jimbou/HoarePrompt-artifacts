Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is `n` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If `no_path` is False, then `k` is `n-1` if `n` is even and `n-2` if `n` is odd. If any character at an odd index of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True. If `no_path` is True, then `k` remains `n` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd.***
