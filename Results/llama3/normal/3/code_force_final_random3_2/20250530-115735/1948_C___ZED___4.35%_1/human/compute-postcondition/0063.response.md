Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 2, `no_path` is False, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still valid, but the value of `no_path` has been updated to False. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
