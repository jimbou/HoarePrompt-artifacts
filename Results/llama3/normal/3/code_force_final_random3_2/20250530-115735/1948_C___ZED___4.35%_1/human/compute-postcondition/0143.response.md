Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string. If `no_path` is True, indicating that at least one character of `a` at an odd index is not '>', then the values of `k` which are all odd numbers from 1 to `n - 1` have been printed, and 'YES' is printed. If `no_path` is False, then the values of `k` which are all odd numbers from 1 to `n - 1` are being printed, and 'NO' is printed.***
