Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 5, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the value of `k` which is 3 is being printed, and the value of `k` which is 3 is printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False.***
