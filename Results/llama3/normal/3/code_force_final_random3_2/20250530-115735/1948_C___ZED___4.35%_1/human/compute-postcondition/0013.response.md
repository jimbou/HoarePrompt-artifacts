Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `no_path` is False, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 0. The current value of `b[k]` is not '>'**

The code sets the value of `no_path` to False, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the input stream (stdin) also remains the same, containing at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs.
