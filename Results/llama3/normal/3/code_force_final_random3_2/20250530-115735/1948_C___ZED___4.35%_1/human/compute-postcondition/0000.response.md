According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input from `stdin`. If there is at least 1 test case in `stdin`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, `i` is 0 and `stdin` must have at least 1 test case.
State: **`stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `i` is 0**
