Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `no_path` is False if any character of `a` at an odd index is not '>', otherwise `no_path` is True, `k` is `n - 1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the values of `k` which are all odd numbers from 1 to `n - 1` are being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` remains unchanged at 2, `n` remains the same as the input value, `a` and `b` remain the same as the first and second input strings respectively, `no_path` becomes False if any character of `a` at an odd index is not '>', otherwise it remains True, `k` becomes `n - 1`, and the values of `k` which are all odd numbers from 1 to `n - 1` are being printed.
