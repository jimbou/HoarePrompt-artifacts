Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is at least 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 5, and 1 is printed. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True, and the value of `k` which is 5 is being printed.***
