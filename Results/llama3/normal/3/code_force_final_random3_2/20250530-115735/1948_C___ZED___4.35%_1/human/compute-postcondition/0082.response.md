Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 5, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, the value of `k` which is 3 is being printed.**
