Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd. If `no_path` is False, then `no_path` is False if any character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>' for `k` in range(1, n - 1, 2), otherwise `no_path` is True. If `no_path` is True, then the state of `no_path` remains unchanged.***
