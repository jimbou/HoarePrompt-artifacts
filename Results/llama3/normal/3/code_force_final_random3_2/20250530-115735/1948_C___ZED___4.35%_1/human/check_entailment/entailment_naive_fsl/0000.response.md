Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, if the input is:

4
>><<
>>><

The program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES'. The robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the arrow in the second last cell of the second row is '>' and if all the arrows in the even indexed cells of the second row are '>'. It does not consider the case where the robot can move down from the first row to the second row and then move right to reach the cell (2, n).
