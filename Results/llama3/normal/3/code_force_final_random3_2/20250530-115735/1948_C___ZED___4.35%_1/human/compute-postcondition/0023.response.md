Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd, and `no_path` is True.**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been updated to True, indicating that all characters at even indices of `b` are '>'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
