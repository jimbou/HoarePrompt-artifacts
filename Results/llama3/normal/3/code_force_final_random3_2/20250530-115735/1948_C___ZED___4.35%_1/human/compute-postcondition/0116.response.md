Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `no_path` is False if any character of `b` at an even index is not '>', otherwise `no_path` is True, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `k` is `n`**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the value of `no_path` and `k`. The value of `no_path` will be False if any character of `b` at an even index is not '>', otherwise it will be True. The value of `k` will be equal to `n`.
