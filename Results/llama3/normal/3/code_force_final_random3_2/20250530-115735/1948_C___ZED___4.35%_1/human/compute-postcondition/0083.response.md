The only variables in the loop head are variable `k`, `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `k` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 6.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 6, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 5, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, the value of `k` which is 5 is being printed.**
