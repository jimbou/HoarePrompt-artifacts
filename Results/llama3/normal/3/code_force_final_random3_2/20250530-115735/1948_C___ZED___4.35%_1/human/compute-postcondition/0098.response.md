Postcondition: ***i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If b[-2] is not '>', 'NO' is printed. If b[-2] is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is not 1, then if no_path is True and all characters at odd indexes of string a are '>', then k is n if n is even and n-1 if n is odd, and 'YES' is printed. If no_path is False or at least one character at an odd index of string a is not '>', then k is n-1 if n is even and n-2 if n is odd, and 'NO' is printed.***
