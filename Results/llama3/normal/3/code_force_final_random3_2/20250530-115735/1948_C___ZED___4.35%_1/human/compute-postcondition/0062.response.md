The only variables in the loop head are variable k and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and n. If k is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is 0, n is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, k must be increased by 2 (because the step in the range is 2), so k is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the first character of `b` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**
