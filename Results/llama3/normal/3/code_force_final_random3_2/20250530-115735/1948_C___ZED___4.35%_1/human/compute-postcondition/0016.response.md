Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 2, `no_path` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are strings, there are at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs in stdin, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 2, and `no_path` is now set to False.
