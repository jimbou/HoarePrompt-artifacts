Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd. `no_path` is False. If `n` is even, then any character at index `k` of string `a` is '>' for `k` in range(1, n - 1, 2).***
