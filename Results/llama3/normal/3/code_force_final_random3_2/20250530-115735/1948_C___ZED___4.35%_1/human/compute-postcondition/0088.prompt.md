Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is `n` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and `no_path` is True.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
    print(k)
    if a[k] != '>':
        no_path = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 5, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, the value of `k` which is 3 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 6, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 5, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If the character at index `k` of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, the value of `k` which is 5 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
