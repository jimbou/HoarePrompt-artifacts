Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 2, `no_path` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `no_path` has been changed to False, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, and the second last character of `b` is still '>'. The value of `k` is still 2.
