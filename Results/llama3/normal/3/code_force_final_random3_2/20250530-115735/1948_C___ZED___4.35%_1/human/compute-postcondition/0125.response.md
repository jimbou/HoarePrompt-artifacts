The only variables in the loop head are variables  k and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n - 1` and `k` is incremented by 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be 3 and `n` must be at least 5.
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 5, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the value of `k` which is 3 is being printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False, otherwise `no_path` remains True.**
