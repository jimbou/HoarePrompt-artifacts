The code `no_path = False` changes the value of the variable `no_path` from `True` to `False`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 1, `no_path` is False, and 1 is printed. The current value of `a[k]` is not '>'.
