The code snippet `no_path = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `no_path`. The initial state of `no_path` was `True`, so this assignment changes its value.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 2, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `no_path` is False, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `k` is 0, and the current value of `b[k]` is not '>'**
