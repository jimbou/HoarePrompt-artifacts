To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1` with a step of 2). Also, `k` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is at least 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is 1, and `no_path` is True**
