Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is not equal to 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `no_path` is True, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, and the second last character of `b` is '>'**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `no_path`, which is assigned the value `True`. The second last character of `b` is still '>', as it was in the initial state.
