Output State: **i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

The code snippet reads three inputs from stdin: an integer `n`, a string `a`, and a string `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated accordingly. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the input integer value. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the input string values. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that two inputs have been consumed.
