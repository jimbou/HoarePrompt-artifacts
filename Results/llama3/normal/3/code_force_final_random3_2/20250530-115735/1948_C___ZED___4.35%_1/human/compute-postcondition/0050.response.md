Postcondition: ***i is 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs. If the second last character of b is not '>', 'NO' is printed. If the second last character of b is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 0 and not equal to 1, then if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed. If no_path is False, then if n is even and any character at index k of string a is '>' for k in range(1, n - 1, 2), 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no output is printed.***
