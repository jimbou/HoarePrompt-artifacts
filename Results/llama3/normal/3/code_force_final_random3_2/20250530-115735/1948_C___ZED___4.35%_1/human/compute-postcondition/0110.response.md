The only variables in the loop head are variables `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `k` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `no_path` is False if the first character of `b` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` is True, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, `k` is 2**
