To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `k`, `n`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than `n - 1` and `k` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 2, so `k` becomes 5. The loop will execute again if `k` (which is 5) is less than `n - 1`, so `n` must be at least 6.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 6, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is 5, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, and the value of `k` which is 5 is being printed, and the value of `k` which is 5 is printed. If `a[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False.**
