The code snippet consists of three lines, each reading input from stdin. The first line reads an integer and assigns it to `n`, the second line reads a string and assigns it to `a`, and the third line reads another string and assigns it to `b`.

After the execution of the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated. The value of `n` is now the integer value read from stdin, replacing its previous value. The values of `a` and `b` are now the string values read from stdin, replacing their previous values.

The value of `i` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
