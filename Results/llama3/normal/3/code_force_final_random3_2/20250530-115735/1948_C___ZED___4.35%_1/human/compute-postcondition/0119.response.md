The only variables in the loop head are variables `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is equal to `n`, so for the loop to execute, `k` must be 1 and `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and must be at least 3, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `no_path` is True, any character of `b` at an even index is '>', `k` is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs**
