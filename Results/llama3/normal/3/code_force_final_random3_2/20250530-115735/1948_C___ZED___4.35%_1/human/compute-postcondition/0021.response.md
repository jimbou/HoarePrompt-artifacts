Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs, the second last character of `b` is '>', `k` is `n-2` if `n` is even and `n-1` if `n` is odd. If any character at an even index of `b` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop variable `k` will be either `n-2` (if `n` is even) or `n-1` (if `n` is odd), depending on the parity of `n`. The variable `no_path` will be False if any character at an even index of `b` is not '>', otherwise it will remain True.
