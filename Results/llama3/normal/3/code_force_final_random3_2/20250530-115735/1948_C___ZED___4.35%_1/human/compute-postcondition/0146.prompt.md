Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), then two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is 0, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 3 inputs. If the second last character of b is not '>', 'NO' is printed. If the second last character of b is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 0 and not equal to 1, then if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed. If no_path is False, then if n is even and any character at index k of string a is '>' for k in range(1, n - 1, 2), 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no output is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If b[-2] is not '>', 'NO' is printed. If b[-2] is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is not 1, then if no_path is True and all characters at odd indexes of string a are '>', then k is n if n is even and n-1 if n is odd, and 'YES' is printed. If no_path is False or at least one character at an odd index of string a is not '>', then k is n-1 if n is even and n-2 if n is odd, and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If b[-2] is not '>', 'NO' is printed. If b[-2] is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed. If n is not 1, then the values of k which are all odd numbers from 1 to n - 1 have been printed, and if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
