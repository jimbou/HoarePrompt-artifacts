You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), then two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: i is equal to the number of test cases, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, stdin is empty. If b[-2] is not '>', 'NO' is printed for each test case where this condition is true. If b[-2] is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed for each test case where this condition is true. If n is not 1, then the values of k which are all odd numbers from 1 to n - 1 have been printed for each test case where this condition is true, and if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed for each test case where this condition is true, otherwise 'NO' is printed for each test case where this condition is true.

```

Return Postconditions: i is equal to the number of test cases, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string equal to the first input string, b is a string equal to the second input string, stdin is empty. If b[-2] is not '>', 'NO' is printed for each test case where this condition is true. If b[-2] is '>', then if n is 1, 'YES' is printed for each test case where this condition is true. If n is not 1, then the values of k which are all odd numbers from 1 to n - 1 have been printed for each test case where this condition is true, and if no_path is True, 'YES' is printed for each test case where this condition is true, otherwise 'NO' is printed for each test case where this condition is true.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
