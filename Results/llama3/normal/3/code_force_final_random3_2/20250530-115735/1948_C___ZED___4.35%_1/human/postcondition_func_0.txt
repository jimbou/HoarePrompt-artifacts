This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an even integer n and two strings a and b of length n, containing '<' and '>' characters. The function checks if a path exists between the strings based on certain conditions. If the second last character of string b is not '>', it prints 'NO' for that test case. If n is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if all characters at even indices in string b are '>' and all characters at odd indices in string a are '>'. If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. Additionally, for test cases where n is not 1 and the second last character of string b is '>', it prints the odd indices from 1 to n-1. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
