Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a string equal to the first input string, `b` is a string equal to the second input string, `k` is `n-1` if `n` is even and `n-2` if `n` is odd, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. If any character at an odd index of string `a` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now either `n-1` (if `n` is even) or `n-2` (if `n` is odd), indicating that the loop has iterated over all odd indices up to `n-1` or `n-2`. The value of `no_path` is False if any character at an odd index of string `a` is not '>', otherwise it remains True.
