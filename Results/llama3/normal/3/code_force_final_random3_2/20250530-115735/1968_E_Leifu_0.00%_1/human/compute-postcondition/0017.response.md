Based on the precondition, the value of `j` is 5. The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`. Therefore, the output will be the string representation of `j` (which is '5') followed by a space and then again the string representation of `j` (which is '5').

Output: **5 5**
