The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that has been input from stdin and is greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is 5, and '4 4' is printed**
