To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `j` is 4. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, the next value in the range would be `j` = 5.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is 5, and '4 4' is printed**
