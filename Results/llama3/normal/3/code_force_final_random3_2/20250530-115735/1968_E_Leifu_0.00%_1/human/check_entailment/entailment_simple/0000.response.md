Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, which represents the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, which represents the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The coordinates are printed in a specific pattern, which is designed to ensure that the Manhattan distances between any pair of cells are distinct.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is 3 and where n is greater than or equal to 4. In the case where n is 3, the program prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3), which maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. In the case where n is greater than or equal to 4, the program prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (k, k) for k from 4 to n, which also maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
