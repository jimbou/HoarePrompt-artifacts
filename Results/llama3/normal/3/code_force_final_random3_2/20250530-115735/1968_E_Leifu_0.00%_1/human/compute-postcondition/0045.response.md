Output State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` remains 1, and `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 4. The input stream stdin remains empty. The output stream contains the strings '1 2', '2 4', and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, the string '`k` `k`' is printed. The loop variable `j` has reached the value of `n`.
