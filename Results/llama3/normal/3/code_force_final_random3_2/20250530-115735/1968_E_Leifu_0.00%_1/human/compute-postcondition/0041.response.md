To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1, so `j` becomes 6. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 6, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is 6, and '4 4' is printed, and '5 5' is printed**
