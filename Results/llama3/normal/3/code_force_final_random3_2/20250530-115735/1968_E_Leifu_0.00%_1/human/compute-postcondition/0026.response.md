Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer, but its exact value is unknown. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin is empty, indicating that no more input is expected. The print statements have been executed based on the value of `n`, resulting in the specified output.
