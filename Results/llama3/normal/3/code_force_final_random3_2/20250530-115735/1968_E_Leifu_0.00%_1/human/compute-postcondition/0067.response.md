Output State: `t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that has been input from stdin and is greater than or equal to `n`, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` remains 2, and `n` remains an integer input from stdin. The loop has printed '1 2', and if `n` is 3, it has printed '2 3'. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, it has printed '2 4' and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, it has printed '`k` `k`'. Additionally, it has printed '1 1', '1 2', and '2 4'. The loop variable `j` has reached the value of `n`, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' has been printed.
