To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that has been input from stdin and is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is 4**
