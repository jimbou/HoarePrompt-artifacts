The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.**
