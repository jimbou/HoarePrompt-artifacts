The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. Since the stdin contains one input: an integer (t) (1 <= t <= 50), followed by t inputs: integers (n) (2 <= n <= 10^3), the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The remaining inputs in stdin are still valid, so there are now t-1 inputs: integers (n) (2 <= n <= 10^3) left in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 inputs: integers (n) (2 <= n <= 10^3)**
