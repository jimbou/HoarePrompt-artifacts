Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer (t) represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer (n) represents the size of a sequence. For each test case, the function prints a specific pattern of numbers: '1 1', '1 2', and either '2 3' if n is 3 or '2 4' followed by 'k k' for k from 4 to n if n is greater than or equal to 4. This pattern is repeated t times.**
