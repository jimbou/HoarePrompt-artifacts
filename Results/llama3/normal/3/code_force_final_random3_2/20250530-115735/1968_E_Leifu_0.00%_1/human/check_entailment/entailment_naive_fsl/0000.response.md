Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4

However, the correct output should be:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

The program is missing the point (1, 3) and incorrectly prints (2, 4) instead of (1, 3). This is because the program only checks for n = 3 and prints (2, 3) in that case, but it does not handle the case when n = 4 correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
