Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, stdin contains no input, and '1 2' is printed, and this is printed: '2 4', and for all integers `k` where 4 <= `k` <= `n`, this is printed: '`k` `k`'.

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations from `j` = 4 to `j` = `n`. The value of `j` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
