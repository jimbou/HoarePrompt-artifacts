Output State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The value of `t` remains unchanged, `i` is still 1, and `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 4. The input from stdin is still empty. The initial prints of '1 2' and '2 3' or '2 4' (depending on the value of `n`) are still present. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop has printed all the numbers from 4 to `n` in the format '`k` `k`'. The final value of `j` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
