Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer that has been input from stdin, stdin contains no input, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, '`k` `k`' is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and this pattern of printing '1 1', '1 2', and either '2 3' or '2 4' and '`k` `k`' for `k` from 4 to `n` is repeated `t-1` times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `t-1`. The input from stdin has been fully consumed, and the output consists of a repeated pattern of '1 1', '1 2', and either '2 3' or '2 4' and '`k` `k`' for `k` from 4 to `n`, where `n` is the input integer. This pattern is repeated `t-1` times, where `t` is the initial value of the loop counter.
