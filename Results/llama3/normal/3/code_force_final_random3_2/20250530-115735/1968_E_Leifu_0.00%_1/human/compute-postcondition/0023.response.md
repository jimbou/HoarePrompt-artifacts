Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, stdin contains no input, and '1 2' is printed, and this is printed: '2 4', and for all integers `k` such that 4 <= `k` <= `n`, this is printed: '`k` `k`'.

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged within the range of 1 to 50, `i` remains 0, and `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 4. The loop variable `j` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated from 4 to `n` (inclusive). The input stream remains empty, and the initial prints '1 2' and '2 4' are still present. Additionally, for every integer `k` from 4 to `n`, the pair '`k` `k`' has been printed, reflecting the loop's execution for each value of `j` from 4 to `n`.
