Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes the number of test cases (t) and the size of the grid (n) as input and prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances can be achieved by placing the cells in a specific pattern. The pattern starts with the cells at coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then adds cells at coordinates (2, 3) if n is 3, or cells at coordinates (2, 4) and (k, k) for k from 4 to n if n is greater than or equal to 4.

The execution summary shows that the program correctly prints the coordinates of the cells for each test case, following the specified pattern. The program's output matches the expected output for the given problem, and it correctly handles different values of n.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
