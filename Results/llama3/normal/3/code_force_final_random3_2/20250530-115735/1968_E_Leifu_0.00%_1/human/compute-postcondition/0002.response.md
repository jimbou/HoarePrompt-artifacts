Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 0. The code `n = int(input())` assigns an integer value to `n` from the input, but since the initial state does not specify the input value, `n` can be any integer. The stdin is now empty as it has been used to provide input for `n`.
