To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`. The objects in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 5, and `n` is greater than or equal to 5.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 6. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 5, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is 6
* `n` is still an integer and greater than or equal to 5

The other states, such as `t`, `i`, `stdin`, and the printed output, are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer and greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 6, stdin contains no input, and '1 2' is printed, and this is printed: '2 4', and this is printed: '4 4', and this is printed: '5 5'**
