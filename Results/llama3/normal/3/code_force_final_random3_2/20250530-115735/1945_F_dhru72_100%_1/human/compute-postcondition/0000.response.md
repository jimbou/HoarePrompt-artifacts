Output State: **`T` is a type variable. stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The second line contains a list of n integers (1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.**

The code defines a type variable `T` using the `TypeVar` function from the `typing` module. This does not affect the values of any variables or the contents of stdin. The type variable `T` can be used to represent a generic type in type hints, but it does not have any specific value or effect on the program state.
