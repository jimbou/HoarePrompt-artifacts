Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The game's outcome depends on the minimum number of stones in the piles and the parity of the number of moves required to empty all piles. The program only checks if 1 is in the list of pile sizes, which is not sufficient to determine the winner.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2 3

The program will print 'Bob', but the correct answer is 'Alice'. This is because Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, leaving 0, 1, and 2 stones in the piles. Then, Bob can choose k=1 on his turn, leaving 0, 0, and 1 stones in the piles. Finally, Alice can choose k=1 on her turn, emptying all piles and winning the game.

The program does not consider the parity of the number of moves required to empty all piles, which is crucial in determining the winner. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
