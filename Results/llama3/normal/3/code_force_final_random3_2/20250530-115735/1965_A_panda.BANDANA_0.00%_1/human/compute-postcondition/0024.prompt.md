Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 2*10^5), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    e = set(l)
    m = len(l)
    if 1 in l:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, l is a list of integers, e is a set of integers, m is an integer, stdin contains at least -1 test cases. If 1 is in the list l, then 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, l is a list of integers equal to the second input, e is a set of integers equal to the elements of l, m is an integer equal to the length of l, stdin contains at least -2 test cases. 'Bob' is printed if 1 is in the list l. 'Alice' is printed if 1 is not in the list l.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the first input, l is a list of integers equal to the second input, e is a set of integers equal to the elements of l, m is an integer equal to the length of l, stdin contains at least -2 test cases. If 1 is in the list l, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
