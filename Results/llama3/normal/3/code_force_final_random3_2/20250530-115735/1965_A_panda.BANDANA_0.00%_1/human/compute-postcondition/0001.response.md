The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 2*10^5) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. Also, since `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 2*10^5), stdin contains t-1 test cases, so for the loop to be executed, stdin must contain at least 0 test cases.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 0 test cases**
