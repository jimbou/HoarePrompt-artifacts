Output State: **t is an integer that must be greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer, l is a list of integers, e is a set of integers, m is an integer, stdin contains at least -1 test cases**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is now an integer, which was assigned from the input. The value of `l` is a list of integers, which was assigned from the input. The value of `e` is a set of integers, which is a set version of the list `l`. The value of `m` is an integer, which is the length of the list `l`. Stdin now contains at least -1 test cases, as two inputs have been consumed.
