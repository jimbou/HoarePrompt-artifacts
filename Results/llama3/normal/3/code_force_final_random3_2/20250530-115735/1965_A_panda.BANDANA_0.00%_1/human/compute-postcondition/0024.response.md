Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to t-1, n is an integer equal to the first input, l is a list of integers equal to the second input, e is a set of integers equal to the elements of l, m is an integer equal to the length of l, stdin contains 0 test cases. If 1 is in the list l, 'Bob' is printed. Otherwise, 'Alice' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be greater than or equal to 0 (since it started with a value between 1 and 2*10^5), `i` will be equal to `t-1` (since the loop iterates `t` times), `n` will be the last input integer, `l` will be the last list of integers, `e` will be the set of integers equal to the elements of `l`, `m` will be the length of `l`, and there will be no more test cases in stdin. The loop will print 'Bob' if 1 is in the list `l` and 'Alice' otherwise.
