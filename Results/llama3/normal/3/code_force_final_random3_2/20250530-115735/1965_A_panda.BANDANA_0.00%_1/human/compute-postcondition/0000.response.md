The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). So after accepting the first integer, stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 2*10^5), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
