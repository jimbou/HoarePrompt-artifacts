The code prints the value of `y`, which is an integer equal to half of `x`. Since `x` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `y` will be an integer between 0.5 and 500. However, since `y` is an integer, it will be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, `y` will be an integer between 0 and 499.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 499 (which is half of x)**
