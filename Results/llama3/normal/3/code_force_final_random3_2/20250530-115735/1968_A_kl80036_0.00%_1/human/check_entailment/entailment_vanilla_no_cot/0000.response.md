Correctness: **False** 

The given program is incorrect. The program always prints half of the input number x, which is not necessarily the number y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

For example, when the input is 6, the program prints 3, but the correct answer is 5, because gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 6, which is greater than gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 5.

The correct solution should find the number y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y, which can be done by iterating over all numbers from 1 to x-1 and calculating gcd(x, y) + y for each number.
