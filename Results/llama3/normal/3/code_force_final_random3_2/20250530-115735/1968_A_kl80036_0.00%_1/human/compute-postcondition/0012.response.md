Output State: **i is equal to t-1, stdin is empty, and y which is half of the (t-1)th input from stdin is being printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to `t-1`, where `t` is the initial input integer. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, as all inputs have been consumed by the loop. The variable `y` will be equal to half of the `(t-1)th` input from `stdin`, and this value will be printed as the final output.
