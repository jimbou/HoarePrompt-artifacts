The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since stdin contains two inputs, the first input is an integer (t), which is assigned to `x`. The second line calculates the integer division of `x` by 2 and assigns the result to `y`.

Output State: **x is an integer (t) between 1 and 1000, y is an integer equal to half of x, i is 0, stdin contains 1 input: t integers (x) (2 <= x <= 1000)**
