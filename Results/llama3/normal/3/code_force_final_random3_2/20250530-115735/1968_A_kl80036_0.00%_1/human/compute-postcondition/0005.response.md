Output State: **x is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, y is an integer equal to half of x, i is 1, stdin contains at least 1 input: t-1 integers (x)**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to the first input from stdin, and `y` has been updated to half of this new value of `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. Stdin now contains one less input, as one integer has been consumed by the `input()` function.
