The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and the input from stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input from stdin. If `i` is less than the number of inputs from stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: t integers (x). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and stdin must contain at least 2 inputs: t integers (x).
State: **`x` is an integer (t) between 1 and 1000, `y` is an integer equal to half of `x`, `i` is 1, stdin contains at least 2 inputs: t integers (x)**
