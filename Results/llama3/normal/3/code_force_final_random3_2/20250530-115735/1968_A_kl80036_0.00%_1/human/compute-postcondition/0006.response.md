Based on the precondition, we know that `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, and `y` is an integer equal to half of `x`. We also know that `i` is 1, but it's not used in the print statement.

When the print statement `print(y)` is executed, it will print the value of `y`, which is half of `x`. Since `x` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, we can't determine the exact value of `x` without knowing the input. However, we can describe the value of `y` in terms of `x`.

Output: **half of the first input from stdin (which is x)**
