The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was initially equal to the second input from stdin, it is now equal to the first input from stdin. The second line assigns half of the new value of `x` to `y`. Since `x` is now equal to the first input from stdin, `y` is equal to half of the first input from stdin.

Output State: **x is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, y is an integer equal to half of the first input from stdin, i is 2, stdin contains at least 1 input: t-1 integers**
