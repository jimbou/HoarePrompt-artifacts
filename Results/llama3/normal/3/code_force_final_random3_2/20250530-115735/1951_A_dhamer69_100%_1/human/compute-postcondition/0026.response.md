Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`. If `n` is 2, then if the current value of `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, 'YES' is printed unless `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, in which case 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
