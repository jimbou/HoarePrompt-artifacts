The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a binary string of the same length as the integer. The first input is assigned to `t`, so `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer that was just assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**
