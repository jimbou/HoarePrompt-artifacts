Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 997, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `t+1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t+1`. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 equals 2, then 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 997. The length of the binary string `s` is still `t+1`, and the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t+1`.
