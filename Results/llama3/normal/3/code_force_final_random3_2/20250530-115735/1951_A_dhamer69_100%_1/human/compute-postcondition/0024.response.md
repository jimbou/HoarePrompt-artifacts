Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`. If `count_1` is odd, 'NO' is printed. If `count_1` is even, 'YES' is printed unless `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` is 2, in which case 'NO' is printed.***
