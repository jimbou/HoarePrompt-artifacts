Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is 2, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as t. If the current value of s is '00', then 'YES' is being printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is being printed.**
