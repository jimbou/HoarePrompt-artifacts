Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is the number of '1's in the binary string `s`, which can be any integer between 0 and `t` (inclusive) since `s` is a binary string of length `t`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, each with a binary string of the same length as `t`.
