Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 998, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as t**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was previously an integer, its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns the binary string value of the input to `s`. Since `s` was previously a binary string of length `t`, its value is updated to the input binary string, which is also of length `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.
