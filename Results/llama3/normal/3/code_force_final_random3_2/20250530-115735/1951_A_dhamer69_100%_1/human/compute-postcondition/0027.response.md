The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 999, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**
