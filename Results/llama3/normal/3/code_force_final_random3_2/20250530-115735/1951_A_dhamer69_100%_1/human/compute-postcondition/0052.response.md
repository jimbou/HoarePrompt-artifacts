Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 998, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is calculated by counting the number of '1's in the binary string `s`. Since `s` has a length of `t`, the value of `count_1` can range from 0 (if all characters in `s` are '0') to `t` (if all characters in `s` are '1'). The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, each with a binary string of the same length as `t`.
