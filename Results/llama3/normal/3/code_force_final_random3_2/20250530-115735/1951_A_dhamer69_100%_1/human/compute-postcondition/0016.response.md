Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer not equal to 2, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`. The count of 1s in the binary string is even***
