Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether a given binary string can be reached by turning on non-adjacent lamps. It handles the edge case where n = 2 correctly, and for n > 2, it checks if the count of '1's is even and if there are no isolated '1's (i.e., '11' appears only once and the count of '1's is 2). If these conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description.
