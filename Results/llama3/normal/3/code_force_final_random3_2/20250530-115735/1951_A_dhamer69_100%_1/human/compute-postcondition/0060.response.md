Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 998, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`. If `count_1` is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and `count_1` equals 2, then 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.***
