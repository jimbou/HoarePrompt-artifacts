Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 999, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`. If `n` is 2, then if the current value of `s` is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, 'YES' is printed unless `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, in which case 'NO' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 998, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as t. If n is equal to 2, then if s is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If n is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if s contains exactly one '11' and count_1 is 2, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'YES' is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 997, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `t+1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t+1`. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the binary string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 equals 2, then 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
