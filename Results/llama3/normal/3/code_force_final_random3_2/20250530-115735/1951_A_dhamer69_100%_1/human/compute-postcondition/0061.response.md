Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 998, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as t. If n is 2, then if s is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if the binary string s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 equals 2, then 'NO' is printed. In all other cases, 'YES' is printed.***
