Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as t. If n is 2, then if the current value of s is '00', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If n is not 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, 'YES' is printed unless s contains exactly one occurrence of the substring '11' and count_1 is 2, in which case 'NO' is printed.***
