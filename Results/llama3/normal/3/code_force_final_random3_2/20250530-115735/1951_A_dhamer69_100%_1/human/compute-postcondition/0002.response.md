Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as t.**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, then reads a binary string of the same length as `t` and assigns it to `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that one test case has been consumed.
