Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as t.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The second line assigns a binary string of the same length as `t` to `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
