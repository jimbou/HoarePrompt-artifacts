Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 999, n is an integer, s is a binary string of length t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as t. If n is equal to 2, then if s is equal to '00', 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If n is not equal to 2, then if count_1 is odd, 'NO' is printed. If count_1 is even, then if s contains exactly one '11' and count_1 is 2, 'NO' is printed, otherwise 'YES' is printed.***
