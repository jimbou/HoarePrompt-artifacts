Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the edge case where n = 2, and for n > 2, it checks if the number of 1's in the binary string is even and if there are no two adjacent 1's. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the operation can be performed any number of times (possibly zero) to turn on two non-adjacent lamps.

Correctness: **True**
