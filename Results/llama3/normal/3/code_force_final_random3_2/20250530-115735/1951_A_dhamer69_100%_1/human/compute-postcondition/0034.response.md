Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `n` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `t`, `count_1` is an integer between 0 and `t`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, each containing one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `count_1` is the number of '1' characters in the binary string `s`, which can range from 0 to `t` (the length of the string). The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two, each with a binary string of the same length as `t`.
