Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements all equal to 10^9, i is n-2.**

In this output state, the initial state's information about `arr` and `n` remains valid, as the code does not modify these variables. The code introduces two new variables: `ans` and `i`. The variable `ans` is initialized as a list of `n` elements, all of which are equal to `10^9`. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n-2`.
