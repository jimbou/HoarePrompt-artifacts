The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i.  If i is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is n-3, So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be greater than or equal to 0.
State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements where ans[n-2] is ans[n-1] - arr[n-2] and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is greater than or equal to 0**
