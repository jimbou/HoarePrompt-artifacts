Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
2 1

The program will output:

999999999 999999998

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Specifically, 1 ≠ 999999998 mod 999999999.

The issue with the program is that it assumes that subtracting the current element from the previous element will always result in a valid value for the current element. However, this is not always the case, as shown in the example above. A correct solution would need to take into account the modulo operation and ensure that the values are chosen such that the condition is satisfied.
