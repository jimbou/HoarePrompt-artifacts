The first line assigns the value of `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` to `ans[i]`. Since `ans[i + 1]` is `10^9` and `arr[i]` is a non-negative integer, `ans[i]` becomes a value less than `10^9`. The second line decrements `i` by 1.

Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements where ans[n-2] is ans[n-1] - arr[n-2], ans[i] is a value less than 10^9, and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is greater than or equal to -1**
