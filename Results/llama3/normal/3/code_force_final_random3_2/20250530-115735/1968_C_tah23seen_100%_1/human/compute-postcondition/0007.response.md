Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements where ans[i] is ans[i+1] - arr[i] for all i from 0 to n-2, and ans[n-1] is 10^9, i is -1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` remains unchanged, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `ans` has been modified such that each element `ans[i]` is the difference between the next element `ans[i+1]` and the corresponding element `arr[i]`, except for the last element `ans[n-1]` which remains at its initial value of 10^9, and the variable `i` has reached -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
