Functionality: This function takes a list of n-1 non-negative integers and a non-negative integer n as input, where 2 <= n <= 500. It returns a list of n elements, where each element at index i is the difference between the next element at index i+1 and the corresponding element at index i in the input list, and the last element is 10^9. The function effectively calculates a new list by subtracting each element in the input list from the next element in the output list, starting from the end.
