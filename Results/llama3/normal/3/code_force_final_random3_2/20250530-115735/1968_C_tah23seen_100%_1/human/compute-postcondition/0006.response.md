Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements where ans[i] is ans[i+1] - arr[i], ans[i-1] is ans[i] - arr[i-1], and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is greater than or equal to -1**

The code modifies the value of `ans[i]` and decrements `i` by 1. The new value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which means it is now dependent on the value of `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it greater than or equal to -1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
