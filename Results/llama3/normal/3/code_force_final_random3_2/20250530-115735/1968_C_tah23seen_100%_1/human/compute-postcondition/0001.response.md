To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `i >= 0`.

Given that `i` is `n-2` right before the loop, we need to ensure that `n-2` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`, we can see that `n` being at least 2 ensures that `n-2` is at least 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `arr`, `ans`, or `i`. The state of `n` already ensures that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements all equal to 10^9, i is n-2**
