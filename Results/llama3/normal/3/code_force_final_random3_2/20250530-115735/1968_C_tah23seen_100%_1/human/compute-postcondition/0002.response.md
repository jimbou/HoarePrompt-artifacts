Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements where ans[n-2] is ans[n-1] - arr[n-2] and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is n-3**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables `ans` and `i`. The first line assigns the value of `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` to `ans[i]`, effectively updating the value of the `i-th` element in the `ans` list. Since `i` is initially `n-2`, this means that the `n-2` element in the `ans` list is updated to be the difference between the `n-1` element and the `n-2` element in the `arr` list. The second line decrements the value of `i` by 1, making it `n-3`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
