This function generates a list of differences between consecutive elements in the input list 'arr' and returns it. The list 'ans' is initialized with 'n' elements, all set to 10^9. Then, starting from the second last element of 'arr', it calculates the difference between the next element in 'ans' and the current element in 'arr', and assigns this difference to the current element in 'ans'. This process continues until the first element of 'arr' is reached. The function returns the list 'ans' with the calculated differences.
