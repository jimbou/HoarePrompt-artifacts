The variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i.  If i is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is greater than or equal to -1, So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be greater than or equal to 0.
State: **arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements where ans[n-2] is ans[n-1] - arr[n-2], ans[i] is a value less than 10^9, and the rest are equal to 10^9, i is greater than or equal to 0**
