Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to find an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. However, the function `func_1` calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the input list `arr` and returns them. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to start with `a_1` as any number between `1` and `10^9` (inclusive), and then calculate `a_2, a_3, ..., a_n` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. This can be done by setting `a_2` as `x_2` plus any multiple of `a_1`, `a_3` as `x_3` plus any multiple of `a_2`, and so on.

Correctness: **False**
