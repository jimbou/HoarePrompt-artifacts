#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers and n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: arr is a list of n-1 non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, ans is a list of n elements where ans[i] is ans[i+1] - arr[i] for all i from 0 to n-2, and ans[n-1] is 10^9, i is -1.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' of 'n' elements where each element 'ans[i]' is the difference between the next element 'ans[i+1]' and the corresponding element 'arr[i]' from the list 'arr', and the last element 'ans[n-1]' is 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of differences between consecutive elements in the input list 'arr' and returns it. The list 'ans' is initialized with 'n' elements, all set to 10^9. Then, starting from the second last element of 'arr', it calculates the difference between the next element in 'ans' and the current element in 'arr', and assigns this difference to the current element in 'ans'. This process continues until the first element of 'arr' is reached. The function returns the list 'ans' with the calculated differences.
