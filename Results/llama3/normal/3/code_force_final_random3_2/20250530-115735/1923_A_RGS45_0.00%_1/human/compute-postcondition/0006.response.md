Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr.**

The code executes as follows: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The third line finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` and assigns it to `x`. The fourth line finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reverse of `arr` and assigns it to `y`. The fifth line extracts a substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`, and assigns it to `z`. 

The final state includes the initial state information that remains valid after the code execution, and updates the values of the variables that are modified by the code. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2, as two lines of input are read. The values of `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated according to the code.
