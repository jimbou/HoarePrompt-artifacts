Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains 0 test cases, _ is t-1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z has been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` still holds an integer value between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), but there are no more test cases left in the standard input (`stdin` contains 0 test cases). The loop counter `_` has reached its final value, which is `t-1`. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` still hold their last assigned values, which are an integer, a string, and three integers, respectively. Finally, the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` has been printed.
