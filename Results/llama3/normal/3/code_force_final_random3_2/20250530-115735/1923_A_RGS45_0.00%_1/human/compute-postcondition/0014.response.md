Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n binary digits. It then finds the first and last occurrences of the digit '1' in the string, extracts the substring between these two occurrences, and prints the number of zeros in this substring. The function repeats this process for all test cases, and does not return any value.**
