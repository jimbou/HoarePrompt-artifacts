The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` first, followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` separated by spaces. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 1) separated by spaces.**
