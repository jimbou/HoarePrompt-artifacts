Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string of binary digits `arr`.
3. It finds the first occurrence of '1' in the string using `arr.find('1')` and assigns it to `x`. This gives the starting index of the first block of '1's.
4. It finds the last occurrence of '1' in the string by reversing the string using `arr[::-1]` and finding the first occurrence of '1' using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. This gives the ending index of the last block of '1's. The `n - y` part is used to convert the index from the reversed string to the original string.
5. It extracts the substring between the first and last blocks of '1's using `arr[x:n - y]` and assigns it to `z`.
6. It counts the number of zeros in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')` and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. The use of `find` and `count` methods is efficient and accurate.

Correctness: **True**
