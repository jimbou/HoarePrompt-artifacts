Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1 as two inputs are read from stdin. The variable `_` remains 0 as it is not used or modified in the code. The variable `n` is assigned an integer value from the first input, `arr` is assigned a string value from the second input, `x` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reverse of `arr`, and `z` is assigned a substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`.
