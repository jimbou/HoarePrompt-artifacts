Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string of binary digits representing the cells.

2. The program correctly finds the first and last occurrences of the digit '1' in the string using the `find` method. This is because the `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, and by reversing the string using slicing (`arr[::-1]`), it can find the last occurrence of '1'.

3. The program correctly extracts the substring between the first and last occurrences of '1' using slicing (`arr[x:n - y]`). This substring represents the block of cells that needs to be moved to form a single block without any free cells between them.

4. The program correctly counts the number of zeros in the extracted substring using the `count` method. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

5. The program correctly prints the count of zeros for each test case.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
