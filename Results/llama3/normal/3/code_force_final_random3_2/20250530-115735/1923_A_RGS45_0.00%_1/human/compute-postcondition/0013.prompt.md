Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 1) separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = str(input(''))
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t must be greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), t is greater than 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z has been printed, stdin contains t-4 test cases, _ is 2, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
