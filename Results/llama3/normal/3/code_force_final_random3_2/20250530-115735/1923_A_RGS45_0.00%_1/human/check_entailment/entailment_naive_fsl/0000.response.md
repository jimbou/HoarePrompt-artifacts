Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index of the first '1' (chip) in the array using `arr.find('1')`. This gives the starting point of the block of chips.

2. Then, it finds the index of the last '1' (chip) in the array by reversing the array and finding the index of the first '1' using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. This gives the ending point of the block of chips.

3. It then extracts the substring of the array between the starting and ending points of the block of chips using `arr[x:n - y]`.

4. Finally, it counts the number of '0's (free cells) in this substring using `z.count('0')`. This gives the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

- When all chips are already in a single block (in this case, the program outputs 0).
- When there are free cells between the chips (in this case, the program outputs the correct number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block).
- When there are no free cells between the chips (in this case, the program outputs 0).

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
