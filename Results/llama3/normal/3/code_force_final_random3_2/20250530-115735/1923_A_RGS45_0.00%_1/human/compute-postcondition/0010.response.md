Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), n is an integer, arr is a string, x is an integer, y is an integer, z is a substring of arr, and the number of occurrences of '0' in the substring z has been printed, stdin contains t-4 test cases, _ is 2**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to an integer input from stdin, and `arr` is updated to a string input from stdin. The value of `x` is set to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, and the value of `y` is set to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reverse of `arr`. The value of `z` is set to the substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y`. The number of occurrences of '0' in the substring `z` has been printed. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Stdin now contains `t-4` test cases as two inputs have been consumed.
