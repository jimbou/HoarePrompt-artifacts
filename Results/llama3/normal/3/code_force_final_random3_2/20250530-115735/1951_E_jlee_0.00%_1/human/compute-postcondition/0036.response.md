Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters from string, n is an integer equal to the length of string, done is False, x is the first character of string. The first character of the string is not equal to the last character of the string. The count of the first character of the string in the string is not equal to the length of the string. If the count of the first character of the string in the string is equal to n - 1, then if the length of the string is an odd number and the middle character of the string is not equal to the first character of the string, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, either n is even or if n is odd, the middle character of the string is equal to the first character of the string, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6) is printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop. If the count of the first character of the string in the string is not equal to n - 1, then no action is taken.***
