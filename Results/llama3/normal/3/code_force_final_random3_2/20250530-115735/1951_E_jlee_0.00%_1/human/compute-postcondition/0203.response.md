Output State: **`done` is False, `count` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to count, `j` is equal to (n + 1) // 2, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from string, `n` is the length of s, `x` is the first character of s. The current loop iteration is skipped and the next iteration is moved to.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not changed, but the loop iteration is skipped.
