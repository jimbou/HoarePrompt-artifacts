The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is unknown, `n` is unknown. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`done` is unknown, `count` is unknown, `count2` is unknown, `j` is increased by 1, `n` is unknown**
