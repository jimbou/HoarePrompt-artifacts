Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters from `string`, the current value of `n` is 1, `done` is False, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one due to the `continue` statement. The program will continue executing from the next iteration of the loop, if any.
