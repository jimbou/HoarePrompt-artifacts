Output State: **`count` is 1, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, `count2` is 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than 1. Stdin is empty. 'YES' has been printed, and 1 has been printed, and the string from stdin has been printed. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then either `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, in which case the string, `s`, has been printed, and 'YES' and the number 2 have been printed; or `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, in which case if `count2` is not equal to `count`, then 'YES' has been printed, the number 2 has been printed, the first character of the string has been printed, and the rest of the string has been printed. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `done` is False, `count2` is 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is now 1. The value of `done` depends on whether `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. If they are not equal, `done` is True; otherwise, it remains False. The values of `count2`, `j`, `i`, `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `(n + 1) // 2` remain unchanged. The standard input is empty, and 'YES', 1, and the string from stdin have been printed. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then either the string `s` has been printed, and 'YES' and 2 have been printed; or 'YES', 2, the first character of the string, and the rest of the string have been printed. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `done` is False, `count2` is 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
