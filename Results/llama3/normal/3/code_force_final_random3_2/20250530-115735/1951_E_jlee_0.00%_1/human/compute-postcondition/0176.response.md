The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, `t` is not specified. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **done is True, count is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, count2 is greater than 0 and less than or equal to count, j is equal to (n + 1) // 2, i is 1, t is greater than 1**
