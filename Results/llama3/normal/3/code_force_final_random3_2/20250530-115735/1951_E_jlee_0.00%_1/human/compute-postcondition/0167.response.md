Postcondition: ***`count` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `count`, `done` is a boolean value, `j` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the first j characters of the string and the rest of the string have been printed, and `done` is True. If `count2` is not greater than 0 and less than `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is equal to `count`, then `done` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the value of the variable string has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made. Additionally, if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then the values of `count`, `count2`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the first j characters of the string and the rest of the string have been printed.***
