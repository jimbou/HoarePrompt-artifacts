Postcondition: ***If `count` is greater than 1, then `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the string sliced from the beginning to `j` - 1 is printed, and the string sliced from `j` - 1 to the end is printed. Otherwise, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, `count` is 0, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.***
