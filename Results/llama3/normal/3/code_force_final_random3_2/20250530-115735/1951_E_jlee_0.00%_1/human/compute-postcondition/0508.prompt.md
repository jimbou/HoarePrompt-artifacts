Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: done is False, count is 0, count2 is 0, j is (n + 1) // 2, i is 2, t is greater than 2, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether `count` is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is `string` has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then the current value of `count` is `j` which is 0. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is greater than or equal to 1, then the current value of `count` is `j` which is 0. Additionally, if `count` is greater than 1, the first j-1 characters of the string have been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has been printed. If `count2` is not equal to `count`, then `count2` is not greater than 0 or `count2` is not less than `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first character of the string is printed, and the rest of the string is printed. If `count` is 0, then no changes have been made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether `count` is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is `string` has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. `count` is 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` is greater than 0. `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0 or 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first character of the string is printed, and the rest of the string is printed. If `count` is 0, then no changes have been made to the variables. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then the current value of `count` is `j` which is 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is greater than or equal to 1, then the current value of `count` is `j` which is 1. Additionally, if `count` is greater than 1, the first j-1 characters of the string have been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has been printed. `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 1. If `count` is greater than 0, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 2. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first j characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string from index j is printed. If `count2` is not greater than 0 or not less than `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1 and `count2` is equal to `count`, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first character of the string is printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 is printed, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the string from index 0 to j-2 and the string from index j-1 to the end is printed. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first character of the string is printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 is printed. The string from index 0 to j-1 is printed, and the string from index j to the end is printed. If `count` is not greater than 1 and `count2` is equal to `count`, then `count2` is 0. If `count2` is not greater than `count`, then no additional actions are taken. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 3, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the first character of the string has been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has been printed. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then 'YES' has not been printed, 2 has not been printed, the first character of the string has not been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has not been printed. If `count` is not greater than 0, then no additional actions are taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
