Postcondition: **If `count` is greater than 1, then `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the first character of the string has been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has been printed, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the string from index 0 to j-2 and the string from index j-1 to the end is printed. Otherwise, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the first character of the string has been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has been printed.**
