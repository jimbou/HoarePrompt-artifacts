Postcondition: ***`count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is a boolean value. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, and `done` is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
