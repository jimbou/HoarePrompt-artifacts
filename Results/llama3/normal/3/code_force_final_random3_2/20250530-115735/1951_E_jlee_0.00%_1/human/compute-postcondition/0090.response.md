Postcondition: **The program processes a string and checks for certain conditions. If count is greater than 0, the program checks the values of count and count2. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the first j characters and the rest of the string, and sets done to True. If count2 is not greater than 0 and less than count, then if count is greater than 1, count2 is set to count and done is set to True. If count is 1, then count2 is set to 0 and done is set to False. If count2 is greater than count, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the first j characters and the rest of the string, and sets done to True. If the character at index j in the string is equal to the first character of the string, then count2 is increased by 1 and done is set to False. If count is not greater than 0, the program does not perform any operations.**
