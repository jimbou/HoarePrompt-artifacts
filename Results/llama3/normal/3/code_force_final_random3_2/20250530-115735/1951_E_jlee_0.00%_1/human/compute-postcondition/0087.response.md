Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters from string, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the length of string, x is the first character of string, if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is equal to j. If the character at index j in string is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in string, then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False. The current value of count is greater than 0. s[j] is equal to x***
