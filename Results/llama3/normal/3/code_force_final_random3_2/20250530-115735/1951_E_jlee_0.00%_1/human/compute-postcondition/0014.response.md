Based on the precondition, the `print(string)` statement will print the value of the `string` variable.

The `string` variable is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, with a length between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). The exact value of `string` is not provided, but it is described as a string of lowercase Latin characters.

Since the `print(string)` statement is executed after the conditions `n == 1` and `x != s[-1]` are checked, and 'YES' and 1 are printed, we can infer that the current iteration of the loop is not skipped, and the `string` variable has a length greater than 1.

Therefore, the output will be the value of the `string` variable, which is a string of lowercase Latin characters with a length greater than 1.

Output: **a string of lowercase Latin characters with a length greater than 1**
