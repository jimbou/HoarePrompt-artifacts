Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters from string, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the length of string, x is the first character of string. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first j characters of the string which are string[:j] and the rest of the string which is string[j:] are printed. If count2 is not greater than 0 and less than count, then if count is greater than 1, count2 is equal to count and done is True. If count is 1, then count2 is 0 and done is False. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first j characters of string and the rest of the string are printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
