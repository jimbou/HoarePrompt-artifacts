Postcondition: ***If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 1, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, `count2` is 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed. If `count` is greater than 1, then `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the string sliced from the beginning to `j` - 1 is printed, and the string sliced from `j` - 1 to the end is printed. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True, `count` is 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first j characters of the string and the rest of the string are printed if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1. Otherwise, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, `count` is 0, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 1, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, and `count2` is 2. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then `done` is False, `count` is 0, and `count2` is 2.***
