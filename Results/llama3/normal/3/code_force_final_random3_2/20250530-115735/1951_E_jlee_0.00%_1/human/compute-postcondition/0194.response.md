Based on the initial state, the code will print 'NO' because the condition that would cause 'YES' to be printed is not met. The variable `x` is equal to the first character of `s`, and the last character of `s` is the same as the first character `x`. Therefore, the condition `x` is not equal to the last character of `s` is False, and the code inside the if statement is skipped.

Output: **NO**
