Output: **`done`, `count`, `count2`, `n` are unknown. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`, `j` is increased by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and `done` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made. 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed**
