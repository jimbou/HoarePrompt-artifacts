Output State: **`count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `count`, `done` is a boolean value. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to True, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `j`, `done` is a boolean value. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to True, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the additional possibility that `count2` is now equal to `count`, because `count2` was incremented by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
