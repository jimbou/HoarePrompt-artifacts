Postcondition: ***`count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is a boolean value. If `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, and `done` is True. If `count` is not greater than 1 and `count2` is not greater than `count`, then `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0, and `done` is a boolean value.***
