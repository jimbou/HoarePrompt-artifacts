Postcondition: ***done is False, count is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, count2 is greater than 0 and less than or equal to count, j is equal to (n + 1) // 2, i is 1, t is greater than 1, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s. If n is equal to 1, 'NO' is printed and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped, otherwise, the execution of the program continues.***
