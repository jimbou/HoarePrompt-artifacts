Postcondition: ***`done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether `count` is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is `string` has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. If `count` is less than 1, then the current value of `count` is `j` which is 0. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. Additionally, if `count` is greater than 1, the first j-1 characters of the string have been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has been printed.***
