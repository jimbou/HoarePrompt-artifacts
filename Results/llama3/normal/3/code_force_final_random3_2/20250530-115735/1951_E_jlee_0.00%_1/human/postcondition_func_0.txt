This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains a string (s) of lowercase Latin characters. It then checks each string to determine if it can be split into two substrings that are equal when reversed. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES', the number of operations required (1 or 2), and the resulting substrings. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
