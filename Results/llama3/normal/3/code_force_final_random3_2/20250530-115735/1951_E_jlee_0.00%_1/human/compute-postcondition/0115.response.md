Output State: **count is greater than 0, count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, done is True**.

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `count` and `count2`, as they are not affected by the execution of the code. The only change is that the variable `done` is set to `True`. The rest of the code is not executed due to the `break` statement, which terminates the loop or the execution of the code block. Therefore, the final state of the variables remains the same as the initial state, with the exception of `done`, which is now `True`.
