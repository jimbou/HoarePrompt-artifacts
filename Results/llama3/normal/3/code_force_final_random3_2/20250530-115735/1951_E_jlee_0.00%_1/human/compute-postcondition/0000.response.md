The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the first line of the input. The remaining lines of input are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6)**
