Postcondition: ***`done` is False, `count` is either 0 or the index of the first character that is not equal to the first character of `s`, `count2` is either 0 or the index of the second character that is not equal to the first character of `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`. If `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the rest of the current iteration is skipped. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string from stdin is printed.***
