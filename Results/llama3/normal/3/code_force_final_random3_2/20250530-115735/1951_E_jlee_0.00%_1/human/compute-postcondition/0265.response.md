Output: **`done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False. `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise `count` remains 0. `count2` is either greater than 0 and less than `count`, or `count2` is 0 or 1. `j` is 1, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than 1. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, either `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, in which case the string, `s`, has been printed, and 'YES' and the number 2 have been printed, and Stdin is empty; or `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, in which case if `count2` is not equal to `count`, then 'YES' has been printed, the number 2 has been printed, the first character of the string has been printed, and the rest of the string has been printed. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged, and 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed, and the string from stdin is printed.**
