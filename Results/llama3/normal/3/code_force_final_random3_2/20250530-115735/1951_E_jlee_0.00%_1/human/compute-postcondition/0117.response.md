Postcondition: ***`count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is a boolean value. If `count` is greater than 1, then `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is True. If `count` is not greater than 1, then `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is a boolean value.***
