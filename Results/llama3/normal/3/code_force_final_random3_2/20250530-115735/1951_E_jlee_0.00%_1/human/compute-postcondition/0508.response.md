Output State: **done is True if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j] for any j in range((n + 1) // 2), in which case 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether count is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is string has been printed. Otherwise, done is False. count is equal to the first j for which s[j] is not equal to x if such a j exists, otherwise count is 0. count2 is equal to count if count is greater than 1, otherwise count2 is 0 or 1. i is 2, t is greater than 2, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s, and j is (n + 1) // 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* If the loop finds a pair of characters at indices j and n-1-j that are not equal, it prints 'YES', either 1 or 2 depending on the value of count, and the input string. In this case, the done variable is set to True.
* If the loop does not find any such pair of characters, the done variable remains False.
* The count variable is set to the index of the first character that is not equal to the first character of the string, if such a character exists. Otherwise, count is 0.
* The count2 variable is set to the value of count if count is greater than 1, otherwise it is 0 or 1.
* The values of i, t, string, s, n, and x remain unchanged.
* The value of j is set to (n + 1) // 2, which is the last index of the loop.
