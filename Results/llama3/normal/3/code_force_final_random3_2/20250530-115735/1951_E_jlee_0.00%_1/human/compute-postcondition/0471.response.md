Based on the precondition, the value of `count` is 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` is greater than 0. Since `j` is 2 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, the current value of `count` is `j` which is 2. Therefore, `count` is greater than 0.

Since `count` is greater than 0, the program executes the if part, and the print statement `print(1)` is executed.

Output: **1**
