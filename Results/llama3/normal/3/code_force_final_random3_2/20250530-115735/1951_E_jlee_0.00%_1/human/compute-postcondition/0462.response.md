Postcondition: ***If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables, and the values of `done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `t`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain the same as before the if statement.***
