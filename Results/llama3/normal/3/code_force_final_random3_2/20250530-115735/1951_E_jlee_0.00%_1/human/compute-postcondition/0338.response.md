Postcondition: ***`done`, `count`, `count2`, `n` are unknown. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`, `j` is increased by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and `done` is set to True. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then if `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, then `done` is True, the number 2 is printed, and the first `j` characters of the string and the rest of the string from index `j` onwards are printed. Otherwise, if `count` is larger than 1 or `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `count2` is 0. No changes are made if none of the above conditions are met.***
