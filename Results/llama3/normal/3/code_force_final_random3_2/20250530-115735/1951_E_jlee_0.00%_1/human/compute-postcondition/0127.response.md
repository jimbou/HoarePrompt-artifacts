Postcondition: ***`count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is a boolean value. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `done` is set to True. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is set to True. If `count` is not greater than 1 and `count2` is not greater than `count`, then `count2` is 0 and no changes are made to the variables.***
