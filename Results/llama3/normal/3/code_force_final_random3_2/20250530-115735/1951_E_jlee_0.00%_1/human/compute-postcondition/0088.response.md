Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters from string, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the length of string, x is the first character of string, count is an integer greater than 0, count2 is increased by 1, done is False.**

In this output state, the value of count2 has been increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that were true in the initial state are still true, including the fact that s[j] is equal to x, count is greater than 0, and done is False.
