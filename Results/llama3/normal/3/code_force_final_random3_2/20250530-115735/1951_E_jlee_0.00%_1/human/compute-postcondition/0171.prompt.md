Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters from string, n is an integer equal to the length of string, done is False, x is the first character of string, count is 0, count2 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program processes a string and checks for certain conditions. If count is greater than 0, the program checks the values of count and count2. If count2 is greater than 0 and less than count, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the first j characters and the rest of the string, and sets done to True. If count2 is not greater than 0 and less than count, then if count is greater than 1, count2 is set to count and done is set to True. If count is 1, then count2 is set to 0 and done is set to False. If count2 is greater than count, the program prints 'YES', the number 2, and the first j characters and the rest of the string, and sets done to True. If the character at index j in the string is equal to the first character of the string, then count2 is increased by 1 and done is set to False. If count is not greater than 0, the program does not perform any operations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `count`, `done` is a boolean value. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is set to True. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is set to True. If `count` is not greater than 1 and `count2` is not greater than `count`, then `count2` is 0 and no changes are made to the variables. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to True, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `j`, `done` is a boolean value. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to True, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`count` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `count`, `done` is a boolean value, `j` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the first j characters of the string and the rest of the string have been printed, and `done` is True. If `count2` is not greater than 0 and less than `count`, then if `count` is greater than 1 or `count2` is equal to `count`, then `done` is True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the value of the variable string has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made. Additionally, if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then the values of `count`, `count2`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then 'YES' has been printed, 2 has been printed, the first j characters of the string and the rest of the string have been printed. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `count` and has been incremented by 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the value of the variable string has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made. Additionally, if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then the values of `count`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
