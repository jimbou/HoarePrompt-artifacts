Postcondition: ***`done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from string, `n` is the length of s, `x` is the first character of s, `(n + 1) // 2` must be greater than 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`***
