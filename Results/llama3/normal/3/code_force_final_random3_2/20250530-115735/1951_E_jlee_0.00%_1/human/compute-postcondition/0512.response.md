Postcondition: ***done is either True or False. If done is True, then 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether count is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is string has been printed. If done is False, then 'NO' has been printed, and the string from stdin which is string has not been printed. In both cases, count is equal to the first j for which s[j] is not equal to x if such a j exists, otherwise count is 0. count2 is equal to count if count is greater than 1, otherwise count2 is 0 or 1. i is 2, t is greater than 2, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s, and j is (n + 1) // 2.***
