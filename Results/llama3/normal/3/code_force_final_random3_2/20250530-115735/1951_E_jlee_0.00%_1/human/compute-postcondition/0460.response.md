Output: **`done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether `count` is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is `string` has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. `count` is 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` is greater than 0. `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0 or 1. `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then the current value of `count` is `j` which is 1. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count` is greater than or equal to 1, then the current value of `count` is `j` which is 1. Additionally, if `count` is greater than 1, the first j-1 characters of the string have been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has been printed. If `count2` is not equal to `count`, then `count2` is not greater than 0 or `count2` is not less than `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first character of the string is printed, and the rest of the string is printed. If `count` is 0, then no changes have been made to the variables. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed, and the string from stdin which is `string` is printed. and 'YES' is printed. and 2 is printed. and the first j characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string from index j is printed.**
