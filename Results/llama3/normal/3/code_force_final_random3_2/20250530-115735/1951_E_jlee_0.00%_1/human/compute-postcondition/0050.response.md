Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the length of `string`, `x` is the first character of `string`, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and the current value of `count` is equal to `j`. If the character at index `j` in `string` is not equal to the character at index `n-1-j` in `string`, then `done` is True. Otherwise, `done` remains False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is updated to be equal to `j`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the characters in the string and the value of `done` also remain the same.
