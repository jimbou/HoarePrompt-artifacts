Output State: **done, count, count2, n are unknown, count2 is 0**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 0 to `count2`. The second line is a `continue` statement, which does not affect any variables. 

Since the initial state of `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `n` is unknown, and the code block does not modify `done`, `count`, or `n`, their values remain unknown. However, `count2` is assigned the value 0.
