Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains a string s. It checks each string to determine if it can be split into two substrings by removing at most one character, such that the resulting substrings are equal. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES', followed by the number of characters to remove (1 or 2), and the original string. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all input strings and prints the corresponding results.**
