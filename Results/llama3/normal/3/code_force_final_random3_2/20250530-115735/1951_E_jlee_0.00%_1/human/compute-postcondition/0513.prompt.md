Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *done is True, count is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, count2 is greater than 0 and less than or equal to count, j is equal to (n + 1) // 2. If done is False, 'NO' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *done is True, count is either 0 or the index of the first character that is not equal to x, count2 is either 0 or the index of the second character that is not equal to x, j is (n + 1) // 2, i is 1, t is greater than 1, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s. If done is False, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *done is either True or False. If done is True, then 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether count is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is string has been printed. If done is False, then 'NO' has been printed, and the string from stdin which is string has not been printed. In both cases, count is equal to the first j for which s[j] is not equal to x if such a j exists, otherwise count is 0. count2 is equal to count if count is greater than 1, otherwise count2 is 0 or 1. i is 2, t is greater than 2, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s, and j is (n + 1) // 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
