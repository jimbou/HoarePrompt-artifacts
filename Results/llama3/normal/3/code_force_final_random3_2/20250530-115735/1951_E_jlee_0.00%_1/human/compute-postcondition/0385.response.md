Postcondition: ***`done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string from stdin which is `string` has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. In either case, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 0.***
