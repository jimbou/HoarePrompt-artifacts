Output: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters from string, n is an integer greater than 0 and equal to the length of string, x is the first character of string. The current value of count is greater than 0. The character at index j in string is not equal to the first character of string. If the character at index j in string is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in string, then done is True. Otherwise, done remains False. Additionally, count2 is greater than count, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed**
