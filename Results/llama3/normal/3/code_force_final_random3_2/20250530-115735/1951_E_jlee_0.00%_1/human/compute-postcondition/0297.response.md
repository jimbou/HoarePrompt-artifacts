Output State: **If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 1, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, and `count2` is 2. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then `done` is False, `count` is 0, and `count2` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `count2` has been incremented by 1, regardless of the conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, with their values dependent on the initial conditions.
