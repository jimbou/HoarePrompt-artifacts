Based on the precondition, the value of `x` is the first character of `s`, and the value of the last character of `s` is not provided. However, it is stated that if `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string from stdin is printed, and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. This implies that the print statement `print('NO')` will only be executed if `x` is equal to the last character of `s`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be 'NO' only if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`.

Output: **'NO' (only if the first character of s is equal to the last character of s)**
