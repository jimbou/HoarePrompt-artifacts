Output: ** `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string from stdin which is `string` has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. `count` is greater than 1, `count2` is equal to `count`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 0. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. The current value of `count` is greater than 1. `count2` is not greater than 0 and `count2` is not less than `count`, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first j-1 characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 is printed**
