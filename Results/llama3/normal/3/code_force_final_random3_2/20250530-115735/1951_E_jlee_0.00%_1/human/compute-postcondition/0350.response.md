Postcondition: ***done is False, count is either 0 or the index of the first character that is not equal to x, count2 is either 0 or the index of the second character that is not equal to x, j is (n + 1) // 2, i is 2, t is greater than 2, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s. If n is equal to 1, 'NO' is printed and the rest of the current iteration is skipped. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
