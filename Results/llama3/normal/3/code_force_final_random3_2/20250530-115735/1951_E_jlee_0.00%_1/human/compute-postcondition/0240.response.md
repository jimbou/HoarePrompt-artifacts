Postcondition: ***`done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False. `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` remains 0. `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0. Additionally, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. The current value of `count2` is equal to the current value of `count`. The value of `count` is less than or equal to 1.***
