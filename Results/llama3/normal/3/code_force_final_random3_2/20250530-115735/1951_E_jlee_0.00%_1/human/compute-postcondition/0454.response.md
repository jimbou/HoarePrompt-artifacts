Postcondition: ***done is True, count is 1, count2 is 1, i is 2, t is greater than 2, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is at least 2, x is the first character of s, j is 1, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string from stdin which is string has been printed if count is greater than 1. Otherwise, done is True if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], in which case 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether count is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is string has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables. count is 1 if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, otherwise count is greater than 0. count2 is 0. i is 2, t is greater than 2, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is at least 2, x is the first character of s, and j is 1. If s[j] is not equal to x, then the current value of count is j which is 1. If s[j] is equal to x and count is greater than or equal to 1, then the current value of count is j which is 1. Additionally, if count is greater than 1, the first j-1 characters of the string have been printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 has been printed. If count2 is not equal to count, then count2 is not greater than 0 or count2 is not less than count. If count is 0, then no changes have been made to the variables. If s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j], then 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed, and the string from stdin which is string is printed.***
