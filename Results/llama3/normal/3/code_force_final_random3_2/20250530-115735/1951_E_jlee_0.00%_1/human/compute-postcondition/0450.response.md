Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `string` is a string from stdin.
* `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
* `n` is at least 2.
* `x` is the first character of `s`.
* `j` is 1.
* `count` is 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` is greater than 0.
* `count2` is equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, otherwise `count2` is 0 or 1.
* `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, in which case 'YES' has been printed, and either 1 or 2 has been printed depending on whether `count` is greater than 1 or not, and the string from stdin which is `string` has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the variables.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`

Since `j` is 1, `string[:j - 1]` is an empty string (`""`).

`string[j - 1:]` is the substring of `string` starting from the second character (index 1) to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will print the substring of `string` starting from the second character to the end of the string.

Output: **the substring of string starting from the second character to the end of the string**
