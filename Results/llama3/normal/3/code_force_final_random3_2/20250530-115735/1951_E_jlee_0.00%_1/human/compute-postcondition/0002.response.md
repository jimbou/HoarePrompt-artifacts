Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters from string, n is an integer equal to the length of string, done is False**

The code reads a line from stdin and assigns it to the variable `string`. Since `t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, and each line of stdin contains a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), `string` becomes a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). The second line converts `string` into a list of characters and assigns it to `s`. The third line calculates the length of `s` and assigns it to `n`. The fourth line sets the boolean variable `done` to `False`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The number of lines in stdin decreases by 1.
