Output: **If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 1, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, `count2` is 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed**
