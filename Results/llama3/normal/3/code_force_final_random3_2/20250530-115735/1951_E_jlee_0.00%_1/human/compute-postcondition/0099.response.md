Postcondition: ***`count` is greater than 0, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, `done` is a boolean value. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to True, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
