Postcondition: **`done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 2, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `j` is 2. If `count` is greater than 1 and `count2` is equal to `count`, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first character of the string is printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 is printed, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the string from index 0 to j-2 and the string from index j-1 to the end is printed. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first character of the string is printed, and the rest of the string from index j-1 is printed. The string from index 0 to j-1 is printed, and the string from index j to the end is printed. If `count` is not greater than 1 and `count2` is equal to `count`, then `count2` is 0. If `count2` is not greater than `count`, then no additional actions are taken.**
