Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: done is False, count is 0, count2 is 0, j is (n + 1) // 2, i is 1, t is greater than 1, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False. `count` is equal to `j` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise `count` remains 0. `count2` is either greater than 0 and less than `count`, or `count2` is 0 or 1. `j` is 0, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than 0. If `count` is greater than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, either `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, in which case the string, `s`, has been printed, and 'YES' and the number 2 have been printed, and Stdin is empty; or `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, in which case if `count2` is not equal to `count`, then 'YES' has been printed, the number 2 has been printed, the first character of the string has been printed, and the rest of the string has been printed. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If `count` is greater than 0, then `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index `j` and both parts are printed. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index `j` and both parts are printed. If `count` is greater than 1, then `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the string sliced from the beginning to `j` - 1 is printed, and the string sliced from `j` - 1 to the end is printed. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True, `count` is 1 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, otherwise `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first `j` characters of the string and the rest of the string are printed if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1. Otherwise, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, `count` is 0, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is 1, `done` is True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` remains False, and `count2` is 2. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then `done` is False, `count` is 0, and `count2` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`done`, `count`, `count2`, `n` are unknown. If `count` is larger than 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`, `j` is increased by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and `done` is set to True. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then if `count2` > 0 and `count2` < `count`, then `done` is True, the number 2 is printed, and the first `j` characters of the string and the rest of the string from index `j` onwards are printed. Otherwise, if `count` is larger than 1 or `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `count2` is 0. No changes are made if none of the above conditions are met. If `count` is less than or equal to 0, then if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `count` is set to `j`, `j` is increased by 1, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the string is printed, and `done` is set to True. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
