Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), string is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6), s is a list of characters from string, n is an integer equal to the length of string, done is False, x is the first character of string. If n is equal to 1, then 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `x` is now the first character of the string. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still has `t-1` lines of input to process, and the current iteration of the loop will be skipped if the length of the string is 1, printing 'NO'.
