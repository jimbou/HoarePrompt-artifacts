Postcondition: ***`done` is False, `count` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to count, `j` is equal to (n + 1) // 2, `i` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from string, `n` is the length of s, `x` is the first character of s. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, then 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the string from stdin is printed, and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped and the next iteration is moved to. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
