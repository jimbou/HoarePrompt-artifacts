Output State: **`count` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `count` and has been incremented by 1, `done` is a boolean value, `j` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the value of the variable string has been printed. Otherwise, no changes have been made. Additionally, if `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, then the values of `count`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `count2` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `count`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `s[j]`, `s[n - 1 - j]`, and `x` still apply, and any previously printed values or messages remain the same.
