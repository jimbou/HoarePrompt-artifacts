Output State: **l is less than the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is equal to the average of l and h, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f, mid_next_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f**

In this output state, the value of h has been updated to be equal to the average of l and h, which is the new mid value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous values and relationships are still valid.
