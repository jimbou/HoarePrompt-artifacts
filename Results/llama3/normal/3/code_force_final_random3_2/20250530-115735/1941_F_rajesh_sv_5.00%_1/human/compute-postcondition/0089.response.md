Postcondition: ***l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is equal to mid + 1 and the original relationship l < h is still valid but now l is greater than the original l. Otherwise, h is now equal to mid.***
