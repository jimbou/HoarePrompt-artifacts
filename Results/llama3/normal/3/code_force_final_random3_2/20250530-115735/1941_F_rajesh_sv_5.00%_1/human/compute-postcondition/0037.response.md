Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the integer at `index - 1` in `A`, `right` is the integer at `index` in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `l` is less than `mid`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the average of `l` and `h`, if `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid + 1` is less than `h`, otherwise `l` is less than `mid`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `l` and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.
