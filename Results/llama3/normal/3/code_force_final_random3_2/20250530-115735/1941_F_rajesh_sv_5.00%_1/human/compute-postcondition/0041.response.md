Output State: **n, m, k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct integers, F is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, f is the first element in the list F, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the integer at index - 1 in A, right is the integer at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, l is equal to mid + 1, h is greater than mid, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

In this output state, the value of l has been updated to be equal to mid + 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between l and mid has been updated, and all other conditions and relationships between variables remain the same as in the initial state.
