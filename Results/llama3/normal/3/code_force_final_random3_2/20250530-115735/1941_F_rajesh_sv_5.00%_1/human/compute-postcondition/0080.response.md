The variables in the loop head are l and h, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l and h. If l is less than h, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, h is equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. h being equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to h is greater than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **l is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, h is greater than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, f is the next element in `F` after the current one, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f**
