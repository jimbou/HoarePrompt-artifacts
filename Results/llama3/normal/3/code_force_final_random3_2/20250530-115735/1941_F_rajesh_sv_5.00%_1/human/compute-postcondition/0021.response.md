Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.***
