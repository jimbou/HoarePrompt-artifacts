Output State: **`l` is equal to the average of its previous value and `h` plus 1, `h` is equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F` after the current one, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and the current value of `mid_sum` minus `left` is less than `right` minus `mid_next_sum`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lower bound `l` is updated to be the average of its previous value and the upper bound `h` plus 1, while the upper bound `h` remains the same. The answer `ans` is still the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of the sum of the element at the current lower bound `l` and the next element `f` minus the left boundary, and the right boundary minus the element at the current lower bound `l` and the next element `f`. The next element `f` in the list `F` is still the same. The middle index `mid` and the sums `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are still the same. The relationship between `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` with respect to the boundaries `left` and `right` is still maintained.
