According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `h`. If `l` is less than `h`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, and `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `h`, so `h` must be greater than or equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order.

State: **`l` is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is greater than or equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**
