Output State: **`l` is equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`, and the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `h`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The values of `l`, `h`, and `f` remain the same, and the relationship between `l` and `h` is still maintained.
