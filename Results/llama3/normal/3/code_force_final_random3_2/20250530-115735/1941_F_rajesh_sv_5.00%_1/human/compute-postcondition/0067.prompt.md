Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *l is less than the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If the difference between mid_sum and left is less than the difference between right and mid_next_sum, then l is the average of its previous value and h plus 1, h remains the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, and the difference between mid_sum and left is less than the difference between right and mid_next_sum. Otherwise, h is the average of l and h, and the difference between mid_sum and left is larger than or equal to the difference between right and mid_next_sum.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is less than or equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is greater than or equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to the average of `l` and `h`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F, mid is the average of the updated l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to be the average of the previous l and h plus 1. Otherwise, h is updated to be the average of l and h.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
