Output State: **l is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, h is greater than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, f is the next element in `F` after the current one, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, mid is l + (h - l) // 2, mid_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2] + f, mid_next_sum is D[l + (h - l) // 2 + 1] + f**

The code block modifies the values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`. The new value of `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, which is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. The new value of `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, where `mid` is the new value calculated above. Similarly, the new value of `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. The values of `l`, `h`, `ans`, and `f` remain unchanged.
