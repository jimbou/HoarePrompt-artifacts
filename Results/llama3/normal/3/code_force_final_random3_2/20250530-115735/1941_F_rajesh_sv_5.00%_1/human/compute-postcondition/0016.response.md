To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `index` is set to 3, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. If `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, then `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`.
