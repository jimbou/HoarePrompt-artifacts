Postcondition: **l is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, h is equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, f is the next element in `F` after the current one, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is equal to the average of its previous value and h plus 1. Otherwise, h is the average of l and the previous value of h.**
