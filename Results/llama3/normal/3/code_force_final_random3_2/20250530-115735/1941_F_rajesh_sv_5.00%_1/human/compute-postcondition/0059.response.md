Output State: **`l` is `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`, `h` is greater than or equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be one more than the average of its previous value and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `h` still being greater than or equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `ans` still being the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` still being the next element in `F`, `mid` still being the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` still being `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` still being `D[mid + 1] + f`.
