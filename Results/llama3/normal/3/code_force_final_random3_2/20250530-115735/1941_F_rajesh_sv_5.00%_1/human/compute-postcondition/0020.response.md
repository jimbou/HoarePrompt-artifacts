Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `diff` is still equal to `A[3] - A[2]`, which is also the value assigned to the new variable `next_max_diff`.
