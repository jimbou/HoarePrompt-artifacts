According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list F. If the list F has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. So for the loop to be executed, the list F must have at least 1 element and f is the first element in the list F.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the integer at `index - 1` in `A`, `right` is the integer at `index` in `A`, and `ans` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`.**
