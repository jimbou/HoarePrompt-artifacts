To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition `l < h`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than `h`. Given the initial states:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order
- `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers
- `F` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element
- `f` is the first element in the list `F`
- `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`
- `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`
- `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`
- `left` is the integer at `index - 1` in `A`
- `right` is the integer at `index` in `A`
- `ans` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`
- `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order
- `h` is the insertion point for `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus one

We need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` to ensure `l < h` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `l` and `h` are insertion points in a sorted list `D` and are determined by the values of `left - f` and `right - f` respectively, to guarantee `l < h`, we must ensure that `left - f` is less than `right - f` when considering their positions in the sorted list `D`. This implies that the difference between `left` and `right` (which is `max_diff`) must be significant enough to ensure that when subtracted by `f`, `left - f` is still less than `right - f` in the context of their insertion points in `D`.

However, since `l` and `h` are determined by the insertion points in `D` and not directly by the values of `left`, `right`, and `f`, we cannot directly infer the relationship between `l` and `h` based solely on the given states without considering the specific values in `D` and how `left - f` and `right - f` relate to the elements in `D`.

But, considering the loop condition `l < h` and the fact that `l` and `h` are indices related to the insertion points in a sorted list, for the loop to execute, it must be that `l` is less than `h`, which means the insertion point for `left - f` must be before the insertion point for `right - f` in the sorted list `D`.

Therefore, without specific details about the elements in `D` and their relation to `left - f` and `right - f`, we can only state that for the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `h`, implying that the insertion point for `left - f` must be before the insertion point for `right - f` in `D`.
