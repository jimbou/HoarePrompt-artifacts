Output State: **l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f**

In this output state, the value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `l` and `h`, which is `(l + h) / 2`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are calculated based on the values of `D[mid]`, `D[mid + 1]`, and `f`. The relationship between `l` and `h` remains the same, with `l` being less than `h`.
