Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F**

In this output state, the value of `l` is updated to be the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order. The value of `h` is updated to be the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. The value of `ans` remains the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The value of `f` remains the next element in `F`.
