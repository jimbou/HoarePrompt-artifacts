The variables in the loop head are l and h, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables l and h. If l is less than h, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l and h are updated based on the comparison of mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of l and h so that l is still less than h.

State: **l and h are updated based on the comparison of mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum, and l is less than h**
