Postcondition: **l and h are updated based on the comparison of mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1, otherwise h is updated to the average of l and h. In both cases, ans is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.**
