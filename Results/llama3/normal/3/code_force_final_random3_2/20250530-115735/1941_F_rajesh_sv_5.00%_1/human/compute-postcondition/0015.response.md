Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `index` is set to 2, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. If `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, then `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`.***
