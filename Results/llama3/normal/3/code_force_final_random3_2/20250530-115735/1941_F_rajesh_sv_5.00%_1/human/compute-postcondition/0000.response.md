Output State: **`testcases` is a value returned by `func_3()`, which is unknown since the definition of `func_3()` is not provided**

In this output state, the value of `testcases` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_3()`. However, since the definition of `func_3()` is not provided, the exact value of `testcases` is unknown. The fact that `testcases` was initially a positive integer is no longer relevant, as its value has been overwritten by the return value of `func_3()`.
