Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `index` is set to 2, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. If `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, then `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is set to 2. The value of `diff` is calculated as the difference between the second and first elements of list `A`. The values of `max_diff`, `index`, and `next_max_diff` are updated based on the comparison between `diff` and `max_diff`.
