Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the integer at `index - 1` in `A`, `right` is the integer at `index` in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `l` is less than `mid`, `h` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values and properties, except for `h`, which is now equal to `mid`. The relationship between `l` and `mid` remains the same, with `l` being less than `mid`, but now `h` is also equal to `mid`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
