Output State: **`l` is the average of its previous value and `h` plus 1, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is the average of its previous value and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be the average of its previous value and `h` plus 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The relationship between `mid_sum` and `left`, and `mid_next_sum` and `right` is still maintained.
