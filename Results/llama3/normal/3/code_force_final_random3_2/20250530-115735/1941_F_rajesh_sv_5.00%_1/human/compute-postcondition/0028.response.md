Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct integers, F is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, f is the first element in the list F, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the integer at index - 1 in A, right is the integer at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f**

The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `l` and `h`, and then uses this midpoint to calculate two sums: `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`. These sums are the result of adding the first element `f` of list `F` to the elements at indices `mid` and `mid + 1` in list `D`, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
