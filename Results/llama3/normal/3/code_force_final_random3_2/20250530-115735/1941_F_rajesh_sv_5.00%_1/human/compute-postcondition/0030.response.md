Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the integer at `index - 1` in `A`, `right` is the integer at `index` in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `h` is greater than `l`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is `mid + 1`, and the current value of `mid_sum` minus `left` is less than `right` minus `mid_next_sum`.**

In this output state, all variables retain their original values and properties, except for `l`, which is now updated to be `mid + 1`. The relationship between `l` and `h` is also updated, with `h` being greater than the new value of `l`. The condition regarding the current value of `mid_sum` minus `left` being less than `right` minus `mid_next_sum` remains valid.
