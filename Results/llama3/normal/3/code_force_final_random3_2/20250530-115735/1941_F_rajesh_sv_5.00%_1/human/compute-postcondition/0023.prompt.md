Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are positive integers returned by func_4(), A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order returned by func_4(), D is a sorted list of distinct integers returned by func_4(), F is a list of integers returned by func_4(), max_diff is -inf, next_max_diff is -inf, and index is None.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `index` is set to 1, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. If `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, then `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`. In both cases, `i` is 1 and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, `index` is set to 2, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. If `diff` is less than or equal to `max_diff`, then `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` remains None, and `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 3. Otherwise, if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
