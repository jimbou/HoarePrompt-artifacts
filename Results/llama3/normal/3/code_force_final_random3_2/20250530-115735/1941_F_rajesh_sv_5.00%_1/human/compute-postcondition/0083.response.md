Output State: **l is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, h is equal to the average of l and h, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, f is the next element in `F` after the current one, mid is equal to h, mid_sum is D[h] + f, mid_next_sum is D[h + 1] + f**

In this output state, the value of h has been updated to be equal to the average of l and h, which is also equal to mid. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of mid_sum and mid_next_sum have also been updated to be equal to D[h] + f and D[h + 1] + f, respectively.
