Output State: **l is equal to the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is equal to the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F after the current one. If l is equal to h, then the current value of l is equal to the current value of h.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `h` have been updated based on the new values of `left` and `f`. The value of `l` is now the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, and the value of `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1. The value of `ans` remains the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The value of `f` is still the next element in `F` after the current one. If `l` is equal to `h`, then the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `h`.
