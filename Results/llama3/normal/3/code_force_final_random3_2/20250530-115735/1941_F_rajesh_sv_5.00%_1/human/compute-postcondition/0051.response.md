Output State: **l is less than the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

The code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range defined by `l` and `h`, then computes the sums `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by adding `f` to the elements of `D` at indices `mid` and `mid + 1`, respectively. These new variables are introduced without affecting the existing variables `l`, `h`, `ans`, and `f`, which retain their previous values.
