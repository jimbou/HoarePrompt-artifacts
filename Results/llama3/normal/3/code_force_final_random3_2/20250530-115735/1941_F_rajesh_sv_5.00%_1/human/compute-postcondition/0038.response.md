Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is the integer at `index - 1` in `A`, `right` is the integer at `index` in `A`, `ans` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to be `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to be `mid`.***
