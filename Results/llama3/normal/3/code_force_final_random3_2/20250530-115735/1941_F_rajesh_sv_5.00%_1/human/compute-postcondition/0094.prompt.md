Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct integers, F is a list of integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the integer at index - 1 in A, right is the integer at index in A, and ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *l is equal to h, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *l is equal to the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is equal to the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F. If l is equal to h, then the current value of l is equal to the current value of h.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *l is equal to h, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F after the current one.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
