Output State: **`l` is the average of the previous `l` and `h` plus 1, `h` is greater than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid` is the average of the updated `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lower bound `l` is updated to be the average of its previous value and the upper bound `h`, plus 1. The upper bound `h` remains greater than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order. The answer `ans` remains the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The next element `f` in `F` remains the same. The midpoint `mid` is updated to be the average of the updated `l` and `h`. The sum of `D[mid]` and `f` is updated to be `mid_sum`, and the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f` is updated to be `mid_next_sum`.
