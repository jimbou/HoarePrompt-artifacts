Postcondition: **l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F, mid is the average of the updated l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to be the average of the previous l and h plus 1. Otherwise, h is updated to be the average of l and h.**
