Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` is either -inf or `A[2] - A[1]`, `index` is either None or 2, `next_max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `diff` is still `A[2] - A[1]`. The value of `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`, which is `A[2] - A[1]`. The values of `max_diff` and `index` depend on the previous values of `max_diff` and `index`, but `next_max_diff` is now equal to `diff`.
