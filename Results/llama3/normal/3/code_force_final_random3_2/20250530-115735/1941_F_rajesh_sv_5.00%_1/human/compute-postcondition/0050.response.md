To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the condition `l < h`. Given the states right before the loop:

* `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order.
* `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1.
* `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
* `f` is the next element in `F`.

We need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` to ensure `l < h`. Since `h` is defined as the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, it implies that `h` is at least 1 less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D`. To guarantee `l < h`, we need to ensure that `l` is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`l` is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`**
