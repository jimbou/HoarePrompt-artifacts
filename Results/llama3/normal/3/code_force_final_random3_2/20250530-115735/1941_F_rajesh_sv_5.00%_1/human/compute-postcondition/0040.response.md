Output State: **n, m, k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct integers, F is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, f is the first element in the list F, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the integer at index - 1 in A, right is the integer at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, l is less than mid and h is greater than mid, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

The code calculates the middle index `mid` between `l` and `h` and uses it to compute `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by adding the first element `f` of list `F` to the elements at indices `mid` and `mid + 1` of list `D`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `ans`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged.
