To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(testcases):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `testcases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `testcases` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `testcases` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be 2, and `testcases` must be greater than 2.

The other variables, `func_3()`, `func_6()`, and the returned values, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`testcases` is a value returned by `func_3()` that must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, a value has been returned by `func_6()` and another value has been returned by `func_6()`**
