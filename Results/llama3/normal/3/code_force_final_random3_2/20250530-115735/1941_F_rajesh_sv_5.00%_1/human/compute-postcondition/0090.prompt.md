Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: l is equal to the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is equal to the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, f is the next element in F after the current one. If l is equal to h, then the current value of l is equal to the current value of h.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: l is less than the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, h is equal to the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, f is the next element in `F` after the current one, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is equal to the average of its previous value and h plus 1. Otherwise, h is the average of l and the previous value of h.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: l and h are updated based on the comparison of mid_sum - left and right - mid_next_sum. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1, otherwise h is updated to the average of l and h. In both cases, ans is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *l is less than h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is equal to mid + 1 and the original relationship l < h is still valid but now l is greater than the original l. Otherwise, h is now equal to mid.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
