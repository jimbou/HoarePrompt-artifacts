Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, and `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged, while `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are updated to the maximum and second maximum differences between consecutive elements in `A`, respectively. The variable `index` is set to the index of the maximum difference in `A`.
