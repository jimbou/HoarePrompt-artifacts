#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a function that takes any number of arguments and returns a value.
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns a function wrapper that takes any number of arguments and returns a value, and an empty dictionary d.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns a wrapper function that can accept any number of arguments and returns a value, along with an empty dictionary.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of values of any type and d is a dictionary.
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: *`args` is a tuple of values of any type, `d` is a dictionary. If `args` is not a key in `d`, a new key-value pair is added to `d` where the key is `args` and the value is the result of `func(*args)`.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the value associated with the key `args` in dictionary `d`, which is either an existing value if `args` was already a key in `d`, or the result of `func(*args)` if `args` was not a key in `d` and a new key-value pair was added.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function caches the result of a given function `func` for a specific set of arguments `args` in a dictionary `d`. If the arguments are not already a key in the dictionary, it computes the result using `func` and stores it in the dictionary. The function then returns the cached or newly computed result associated with the given arguments.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin is a file object that contains a string
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is read from the file object stdin, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line from the standard input file object (stdin), removes leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_2() returns a string that represents an integer.
    return int(func_2())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_2()

#Overall this is what the function does:The function converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_2() into an actual integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string, func_2() returns a string containing space-separated integers.
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are obtained by splitting the string returned by func_2() into substrings separated by the delimiter string, and then converting each substring into an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a delimiter string as input and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by first obtaining a string of space-separated integers from an external function (func_2()), then splitting this string into substrings based on the provided delimiter, and finally converting each substring into an integer. The resulting list of integers is then returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined from the given function signature as it does not contain any parameters.
    return func_2()
    #The program returns the value returned by the function `func_2()`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calls and returns the result of another function named `func_2()`, effectively acting as a proxy or wrapper for `func_2()` without modifying or adding any functionality of its own.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct integers, F is a list of integers, and inf is a negative infinity value.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `F` is a list of integers, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, and `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`.

                l = mid + 1
            else:
                h = mid
        
        if l == h:
            ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))
        
    #State: ans is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f for all f in F, l is equal to the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is equal to the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, f is the last element in F.
    print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
    #This is printed: max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f for all f in F, and next_max_diff is an unknown value)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list A, and then iterates over a list F to find the minimum maximum difference between the maximum difference in A and the differences between elements in A and a sorted list D, offset by elements in F. The function returns the maximum of the minimum maximum difference found and the second maximum difference in A.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: testcases is a positive integer
    testcases = func_3()
    for _ in range(testcases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: `testcases` is a value returned by `func_3()` that must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `testcases - 1`, and `testcases` number of values have been returned by `func_6()`

#Overall this is what the function does:Executes a loop a certain number of times, determined by the return value of `func_3()`, and calls `func_6()` in each iteration, returning a total of `testcases` number of values from `func_6()`.
