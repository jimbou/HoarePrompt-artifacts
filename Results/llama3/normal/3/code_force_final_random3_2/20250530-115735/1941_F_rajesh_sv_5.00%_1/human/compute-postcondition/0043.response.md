Postcondition: ***n, m, k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of distinct integers, F is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, f is the first element in the list F, max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the integer at index - 1 in A, right is the integer at index in A, ans is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is equal to mid + 1 and h is greater than mid. Otherwise, l is less than mid and h is equal to mid.***
