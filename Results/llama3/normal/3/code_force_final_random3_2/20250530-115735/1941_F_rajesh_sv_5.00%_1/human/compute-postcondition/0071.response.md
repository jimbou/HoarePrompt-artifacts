The only variable in the loop head is variable `f`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `f`. If `f` is the next element in `F`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `f` is the next element in `F`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `f` must be the next element in `F` after the current one.
State: **`l` is equal to the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order, `h` is equal to the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f, `f` is the next element in F after the current one. If `l` is equal to `h`, then the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `h`.**
