Output State: **`testcases` is a value returned by `func_3()` that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, a value has been returned by `func_6()` and another value has been returned by `func_6()`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `testcases` is still greater than 1 and is a value returned by `func_3()`. The value of `_` is still 1. A value has been returned by `func_6()` initially and another value has been returned by `func_6()` after the execution of the given code.
