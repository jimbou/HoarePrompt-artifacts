Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F` after the current one, and the current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `h`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The values of `l`, `h`, and `f` remain the same as in the initial state. The relationship between `l` and `h` is still maintained, and `f` is still the next element in `F` after the current one.
