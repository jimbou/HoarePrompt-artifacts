Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is an empty list, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with additional strings that are the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing at least one element, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with additional strings that are the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None, and this is printed: the last element of trumps, the trump suit, the second last element of trumps, the trump suit
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing at least two elements, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with additional strings that are the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None, and this is printed: the last element of trumps, the trump suit, the second last element of trumps, the trump suit
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing at least one element, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with additional strings that are the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None, and this is printed: the last element of trumps, the trump suit, the second last element of trumps, the trump suit


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
