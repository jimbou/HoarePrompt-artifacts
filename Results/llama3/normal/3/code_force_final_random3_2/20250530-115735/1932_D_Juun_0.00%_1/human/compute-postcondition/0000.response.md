Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None**.

Explanation: The first line reads an integer from stdin, which is the number of test cases. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second line reads a character from stdin, which is the trump suit, and assigns it to the variable 'trump'. The third and fourth lines initialize two empty lists, 'trumps' and 'answers', respectively. The fifth line initializes a dictionary 'suits' with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are set to None.
