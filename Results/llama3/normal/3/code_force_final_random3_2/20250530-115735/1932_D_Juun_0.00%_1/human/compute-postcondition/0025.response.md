Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-6 test cases if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise stdin contains t-5 test cases. trump is a character (one of "CDHS"). trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the rank of the third card in the input().split() if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() and the rank of the fourth card in the input().split() if the suit of the fourth card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split(). answers is an empty list if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise answers is a list containing one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the third card and the minimum of the rank of the third card and the previous rank of the suit of the third card if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the third card is not None, otherwise answers contains one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the third card and the rank of the third card if the suit of the fourth card is not equal to trump, otherwise answers contains one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the fourth card and the minimum of the rank of the fourth card and the previous rank of the suit of the fourth card if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the fourth card is not None, otherwise answers contains one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the fourth card and the rank of the fourth card. suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is rank if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and suits[suit] was None before the if else block, otherwise suits[suit] is None if the suit of the fourth card is not equal to trump, otherwise suits[suit] is updated to rank. rank is the rank of the fourth card in the input().split(), and suit is the suit of the fourth card in the input().split() and suits[suit] is updated to rank if the previous rank of the suit of the fourth card is None. card is the fourth card in the input().split()***
