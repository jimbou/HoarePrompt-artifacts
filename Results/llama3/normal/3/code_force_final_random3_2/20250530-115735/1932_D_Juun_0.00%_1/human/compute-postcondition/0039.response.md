Postcondition: ***stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a non-empty list containing the rank of all cards in the input().split() with one less element, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with an additional string that is the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None, and suits has at least one more key-value pair left to iterate over. If rank is None, we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.***
