Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values are None
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-3 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is rank if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and suits[suit] was None before the if else block, otherwise suits[suit] is None, suit is the suit of the first card in the input().split(), and rank is the rank of the first card in the input().split()

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: stdin contains t-5 test cases if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise stdin contains t-4 test cases. trump is a character (one of "CDHS"). trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the rank of the third card in the input().split() if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is an empty list. answers is an empty list if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise answers is a list containing one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the third card and the minimum of the rank of the third card and the previous rank of the suit of the third card if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the third card is not None, otherwise answers contains one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the third card and the rank of the third card. suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is rank if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and suits[suit] was None before the if else block, otherwise suits[suit] is None. rank is the rank of the third card in the input().split(), and suit is the suit of the third card in the input().split() and suits[suit] is updated to rank if the previous rank of the suit of the third card is None.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains t-6 test cases if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise stdin contains t-5 test cases. trump is a character (one of "CDHS"). trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the rank of the third card in the input().split() if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() and the rank of the fourth card in the input().split() if the suit of the fourth card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split(). answers is an empty list if the suit of the third card is equal to trump, otherwise answers is a list containing one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the third card and the minimum of the rank of the third card and the previous rank of the suit of the third card if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the third card is not None, otherwise answers contains one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the third card and the rank of the third card if the suit of the fourth card is not equal to trump, otherwise answers contains one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the fourth card and the minimum of the rank of the fourth card and the previous rank of the suit of the fourth card if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the fourth card is not None, otherwise answers contains one more string that is the concatenation of the suit of the fourth card and the rank of the fourth card. suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is rank if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and suits[suit] was None before the if else block, otherwise suits[suit] is None if the suit of the fourth card is not equal to trump, otherwise suits[suit] is updated to rank. rank is the rank of the fourth card in the input().split(), and suit is the suit of the fourth card in the input().split() and suits[suit] is updated to rank if the previous rank of the suit of the fourth card is None. card is the fourth card in the input().split()




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
