Output State: **stdin contains t-4 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is rank if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and suits[suit] was None before the if else block, otherwise suits[suit] is None, rank is the rank of the third card in the input().split(), and suit is the suit of the third card in the input().split() and suits[suit] is updated to rank.**

In natural language, the output state is: The stdin still contains t-4 test cases. The trump is still a character which is one of "CDHS". The trumps list is still the same. The answers list is still empty. The suits dictionary is updated such that the value of suits[suit] is now rank. The rank and suit are still the same.
