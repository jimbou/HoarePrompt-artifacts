Output State: **stdin contains t-4 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of the first card in the input().split() if the suit of the first card is equal to trump, otherwise trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is rank if the suit of the first card is not equal to trump and suits[suit] was None before the if else block, otherwise suits[suit] is None, rank is the rank of the third card in the input().split(), and suit is the suit of the third card in the input().split()**

In this output state, the values of trump, trumps, answers, and suits remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t-4 test cases because one test case has been processed. The variables rank and suit have been updated to hold the rank and suit of the third card in the input().split(), respectively.
