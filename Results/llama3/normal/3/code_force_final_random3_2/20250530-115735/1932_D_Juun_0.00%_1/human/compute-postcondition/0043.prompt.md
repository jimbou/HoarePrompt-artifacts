Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of all cards in the input().split() if the suit of the card is equal to trump, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is None, rank is the rank of the last card in the input().split(), and suit is the suit of the last card in the input().split().
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a non-empty list containing the rank of all cards in the input().split() with one less element, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with an additional string that is the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a non-empty list containing the rank of all cards in the input().split() with one less element, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with an additional string that is the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None, and suits has at least one more key-value pair left to iterate over. If rank is None, we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a non-empty list containing the rank of all cards in the input().split() with one less element, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with an additional string that is the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None, and suits has at least one more key-value pair left to iterate over, suit is the next suit in the dictionary suits, rank is the next rank in the dictionary suits, and if rank is None, we skip the current iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
