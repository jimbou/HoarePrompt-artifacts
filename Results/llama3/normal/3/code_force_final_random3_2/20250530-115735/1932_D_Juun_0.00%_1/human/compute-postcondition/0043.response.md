Output State: **stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is an empty list, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, with additional strings that are the concatenation of the rank of the last card in trumps, the trump suit, the suit of the card and the trump suit, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the stdin still contains 0 test cases, the trump is still a character (one of "CDHS"), the trumps list is now empty, the answers list contains all the concatenated strings as described, and the suits dictionary still has keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' with non-None values.
