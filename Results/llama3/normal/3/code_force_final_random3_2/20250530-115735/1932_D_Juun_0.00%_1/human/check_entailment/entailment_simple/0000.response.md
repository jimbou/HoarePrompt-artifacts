Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to reconstruct the rounds played in the game. It first separates the cards into trump cards and non-trump cards. Then, it tries to pair the non-trump cards of the same suit in increasing order of their ranks. If there are any remaining non-trump cards, it tries to pair them with the trump cards. If there are not enough trump cards to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE". Finally, it prints the pairs of cards that were played in each round.

Correctness: **True**
