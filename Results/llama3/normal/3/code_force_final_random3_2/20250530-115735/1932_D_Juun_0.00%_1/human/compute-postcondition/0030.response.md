Postcondition: **stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of all cards in the input().split() if the suit of the card is equal to trump, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None, and if the rank of the last card in the input().split() is None, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, the program continues with the current values of rank and suit.**
