The code prints a formatted string containing the last element of the trumps list, the trump suit, the second last element of the trumps list, and the trump suit.
Since the exact elements of the trumps list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the last and second last elements of the trumps list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the last element of the trumps list, the trump suit, the second last element of the trumps list, and the trump suit.
Output: **the last element of trumps, trump, the second last element of trumps, trump (where trump is the trump suit and trumps is the list of trumps)**
