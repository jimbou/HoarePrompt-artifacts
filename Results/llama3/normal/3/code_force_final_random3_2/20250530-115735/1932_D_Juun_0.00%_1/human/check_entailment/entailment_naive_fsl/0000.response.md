Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when there are multiple cards of the same suit that are not trump cards. In this case, the program will assign the same suit to multiple cards, which is incorrect. For example, if the input is "3C 4C 5C 6D 3S 7S", the program will assign the suit 'C' to all three cards 3C, 4C, and 5C, which is incorrect.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when there are no trump cards. In this case, the program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" even if there is a possible sequence of rounds that can be played.

The program also does not handle the case when there are multiple cards of the same rank but different suits. In this case, the program will assign the same rank to multiple cards, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
