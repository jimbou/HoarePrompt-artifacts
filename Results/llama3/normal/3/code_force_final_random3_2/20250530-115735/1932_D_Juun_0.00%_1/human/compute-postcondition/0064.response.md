Output State: **trumps is an empty list, stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), answers is an empty list, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is not None, and all elements in the list answers have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `answers` will be empty because all its elements have been printed, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
