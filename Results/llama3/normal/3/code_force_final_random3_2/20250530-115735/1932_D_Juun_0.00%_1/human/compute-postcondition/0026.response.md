Output State: **stdin contains 0 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list containing the rank of all cards in the input().split() if the suit of the card is equal to trump, answers is a list containing strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the minimum of the rank of the card and the previous rank of the suit of the card if the suit of the card is not equal to trump and the previous rank of the suit of the card is not None, otherwise answers contains strings that are the concatenation of the suit of the card and the rank of the card, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and the value of suits[suit] is None, rank is the rank of the last card in the input().split(), and suit is the suit of the last card in the input().split().**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the input buffer will be empty, the trump variable will still hold the same value, the trumps list will contain the ranks of all cards that have the same suit as the trump, the answers list will contain strings that represent the minimum rank of each suit, and the suits dictionary will have all its values reset to None. The rank and suit variables will hold the values of the last card processed.
