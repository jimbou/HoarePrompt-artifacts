Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an empty list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it can be either 0 or 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
