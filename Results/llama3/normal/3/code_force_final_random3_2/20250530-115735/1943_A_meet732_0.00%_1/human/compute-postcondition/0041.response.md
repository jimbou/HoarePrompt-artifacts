The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list `a`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is 1, `cntl[0]` is 0**
