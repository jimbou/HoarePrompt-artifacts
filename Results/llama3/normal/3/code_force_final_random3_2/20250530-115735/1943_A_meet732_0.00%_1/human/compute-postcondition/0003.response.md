Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where cntl[i] is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
