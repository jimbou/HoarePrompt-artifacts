The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the i is the third integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 3 and `cntl[0]` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`.**
