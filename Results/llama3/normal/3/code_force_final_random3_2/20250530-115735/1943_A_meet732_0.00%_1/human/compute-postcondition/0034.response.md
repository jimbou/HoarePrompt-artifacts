Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least the last integer in the original list plus 2, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the original list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `i`, `cntl`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
