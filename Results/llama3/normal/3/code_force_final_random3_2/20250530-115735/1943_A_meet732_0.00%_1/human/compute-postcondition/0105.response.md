Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an empty list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1, the list `a` is still empty, the list `cntl` still contains `n+1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of `i` in list `a`, the first element of `cntl` is still not equal to 0, `c` is still either 0 or 1, `j` is still 2, and we have exited the innermost loop or if statement.
