Output State: **n is an integer, a is an empty list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i is equal to the number of times i appears in a, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `cntl` will contain the count of each integer that appeared in `a`, where the index of the count corresponds to the integer value. For example, if `a` was `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `cntl` would be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, ...]` because 1 appears once, 2 appears twice, and 3 appears three times. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `stdin` still contains no input.
