Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
3. It creates a count array `cntl` of size `n+1` to keep track of the frequency of each element in `a`.
4. It then checks if the count of 0 in `cntl` is 0. If it is, it means that 0 is not present in `a`, so the MEX of `c` will be 0. In this case, it prints 0.
5. If the count of 0 is not 0, it sets a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0. This is because Alice can pick at most two 0s to maximize the MEX of `c`.
6. It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the count of each element `j` in `cntl` is less than 2. If it is, it decrements `c` by 1.
7. If `c` becomes 0 or if `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` as the final score.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, so she will pick elements that are not present in `c` or are present only once. Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, so he will pick elements that are present in `c` or are present more than once.

The program's use of the count array `cntl` and the variable `c` allows it to efficiently keep track of the frequency of each element in `a` and the maximum MEX of `c` that Alice can achieve.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**
