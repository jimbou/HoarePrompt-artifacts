Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 1 or greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `c` is determined by the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. Since `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` will be either 1 or 2, depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 1 or greater than 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
