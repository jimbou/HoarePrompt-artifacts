Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the original list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their original values except for `c`, which is assigned the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`. Since `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` will be either 1 or 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
