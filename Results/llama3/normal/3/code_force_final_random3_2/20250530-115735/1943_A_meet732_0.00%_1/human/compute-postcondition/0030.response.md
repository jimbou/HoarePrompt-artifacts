The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last integer in the original list, `n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is the last integer in the original list plus 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the last integer in the original list plus 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least the last integer in the original list plus 2, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the original list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `c` is 1 and `j` is not equal to `n`, the program continues to execute. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, the program continues to execute, `j` is the last integer in the original list plus 1**
