Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is 3 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cntl[i]` being 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
