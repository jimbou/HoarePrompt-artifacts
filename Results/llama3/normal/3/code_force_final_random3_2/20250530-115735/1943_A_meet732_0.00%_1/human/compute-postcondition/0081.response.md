Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first element in `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `cntl` now has one element that is 1 (at index `i`) and all other elements are still 0.
