Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either -2, -1 or 0, and `j` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `c` is either -2 or -1 and if `c` is not -2 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. and the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed**
