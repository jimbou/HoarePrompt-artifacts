Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either -2, -1 or 0, `j` is 2. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
