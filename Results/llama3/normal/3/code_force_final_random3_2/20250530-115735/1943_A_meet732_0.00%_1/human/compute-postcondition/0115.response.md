Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is 0, `j` is `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and has printed the value of `j` which is equal to `n`. The value of `c` has been decremented to 0, and the loop has terminated. The other variables, `n`, `a`, and `cntl`, remain unchanged.
