Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers. It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and then finds the smallest index j such that the count of j is less than 2. If no such j exists, it returns the length of the list. If the count of 0 is 0, it returns 0. The function prints the result for each test case and terminates after processing all test cases.**
