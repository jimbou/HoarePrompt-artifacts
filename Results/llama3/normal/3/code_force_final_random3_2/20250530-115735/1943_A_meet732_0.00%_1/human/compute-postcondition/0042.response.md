Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and `cntl[0]` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The list `a` still has at least 1 integer, and `i` is still the first integer in the list `a`.
