Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the original list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variables `n`, `a`, `i`, `cntl`, `c`, and `cntl[0]` retain their original values, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
