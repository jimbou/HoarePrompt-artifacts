To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. This means `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1**
