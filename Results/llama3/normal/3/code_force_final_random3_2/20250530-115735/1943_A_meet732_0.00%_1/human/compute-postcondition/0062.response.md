To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to the last integer in the list `a`, which is not necessarily equal to `n`. To execute the loop again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, `j` is the last integer in the list `a` plus 1**
