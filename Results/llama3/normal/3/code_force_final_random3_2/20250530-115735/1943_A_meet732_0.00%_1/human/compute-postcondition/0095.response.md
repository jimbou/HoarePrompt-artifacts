Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. Additionally, either `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.***
