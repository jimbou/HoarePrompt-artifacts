Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either -1 or 0, `j` is the last integer in the list `a` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, `c`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
