Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n+1` to keep track of the count of each integer in the list `a`. This is done to efficiently determine the MEX of the list `c` that Alice constructs.

3. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not present in the list `a`, so the MEX of `c` will be 0. In this case, the program correctly prints 0.

4. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, it means that 0 is present in the list `a`. In this case, the program initializes a variable `c` to 2 (or `cntl[0]` if it's less than 2), which represents the number of elements that Alice needs to pick to maximize the MEX of `c`.

5. The program then iterates over the list `cntl` starting from index 1. For each index `j`, if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that `j` is not present in the list `a` or is present only once. In this case, the program decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0 or if `j` is equal to `n`, it means that Alice has picked enough elements to maximize the MEX of `c`, so the program prints `j`.

6. The program correctly handles the case where `cntl[j]` is 0 for some `j`, in which case `j` is not present in the list `a` and should be the MEX of `c`.

7. The program also correctly handles the case where `cntl[j]` is 1 for some `j`, in which case `j` is present only once in the list `a` and should be the MEX of `c` if Alice picks it.

8. The program correctly handles the case where `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 2 for all `j`, in which case the MEX of `c` will be `n`.

Correctness: **True**
