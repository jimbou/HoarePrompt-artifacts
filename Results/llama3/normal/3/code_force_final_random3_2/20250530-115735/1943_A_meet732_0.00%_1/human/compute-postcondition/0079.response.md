The code snippet provided consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. The third line creates a list `cntl` of `n+1` integers, all initialized to 0.

Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where all elements are 0, stdin contains no input**
