Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, i is the last integer in the list a, cntl[i] is 1, cntl[0] is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer, which was read from the input. The list `a` now contains a list of integers, which were also read from the input. The list `cntl` is initialized with `n+1` zeros. The variable `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. The value of `cntl[i]` is 1, indicating that the integer `i` appears once in the list `a`. The value of `cntl[0]` is 0, indicating that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
