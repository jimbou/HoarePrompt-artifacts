Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 4 and `cntl[0]` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the third integer in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
