Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. The third line creates a list `cntl` of `n+1` zeros. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
