Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either -2, -1 or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `j` which is 2 is being printed.
