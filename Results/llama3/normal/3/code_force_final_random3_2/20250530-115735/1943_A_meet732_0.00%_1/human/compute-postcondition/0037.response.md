Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the original list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, `j` is `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer, `a` remains an empty list, `i` remains the last integer in the original list, `cntl` remains a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is the count of `i` in the original list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The loop variable `j` has reached its final value of `n`. The value of `c` has been decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and it can be either 0 or 1 depending on the number of such iterations.
