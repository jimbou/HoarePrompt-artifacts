Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4). Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the original list, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where cntl[i] is the count of i in the original list a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. If cntl[0] is 0, the value 0 is printed. Otherwise, cntl[0] is not equal to 0 and j is set to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where cntl[i] is the number of occurrences of i in a. If cntl[0] is 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, and the program continues with the next test case

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, a is an empty list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i is equal to the number of times i appears in a, stdin contains no input. If cntl[0] is 0, the number 0 is being printed. If cntl[0] is not 0, c is 0 and j is n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
