Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers.
