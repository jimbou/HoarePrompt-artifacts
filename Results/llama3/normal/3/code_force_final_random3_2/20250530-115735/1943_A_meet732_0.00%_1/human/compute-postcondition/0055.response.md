The value of `c` is decreased by 1. The value of `c` can be either 1 or 2, depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 1 or greater than 1. So, the value of `c` is now either 0 or 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, j is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, j is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2.**
