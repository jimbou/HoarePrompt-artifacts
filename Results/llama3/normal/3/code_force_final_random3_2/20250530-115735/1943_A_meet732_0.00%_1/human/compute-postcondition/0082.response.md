To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to take on the value of the next element in `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers, there must be at least two elements in `a` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the second element in `a`.**
