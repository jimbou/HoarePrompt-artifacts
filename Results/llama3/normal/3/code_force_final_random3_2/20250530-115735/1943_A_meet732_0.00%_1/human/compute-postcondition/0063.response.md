Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is the number of occurrences of `i` in `a` and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is either -1 or 0, `j` is the last integer in the list `a` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it can be either -1 or 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
