To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 integer, and `i` is the first integer in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more integer, and `i` must be the next integer in the list `a`. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `a` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be the second integer in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and `cntl[0]` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.**
