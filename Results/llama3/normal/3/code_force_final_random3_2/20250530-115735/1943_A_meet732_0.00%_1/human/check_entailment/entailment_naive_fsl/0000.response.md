Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the final score of the game if both players play optimally.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. It then creates a count list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to store the frequency of each element in the array `a`.

3. If the count of 0 is 0, it means that 0 is not present in the array, so the MEX is 0.

4. If the count of 0 is not 0, it means that 0 is present in the array. In this case, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0. This is because Alice can choose at most two 0's to maximize the MEX.

5. The program then iterates over the count list from 1 to `n`. If the count of an element is less than 2, it means that Bob can choose this element to minimize the MEX. In this case, the program decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0 or the current element is `n`, it means that the MEX is the current element, so the program prints the current element and breaks the loop.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the final score of the game if both players play optimally. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
