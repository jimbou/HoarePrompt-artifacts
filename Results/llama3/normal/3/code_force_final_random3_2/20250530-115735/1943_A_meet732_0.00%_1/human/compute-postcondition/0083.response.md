The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the second element in `a`, `cntl[i]` is the third element in `cntl` (index 1). The third element in `cntl` was 1, so now it is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 2, and all other elements are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the second element in `a`.**
