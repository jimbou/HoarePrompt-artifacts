Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where cntl[i] is the number of occurrences of i in a and cntl[0] is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers, i is the last integer in the list a.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the list `cntl` now contains the count of each integer in `a`. The count of each integer `i` in `a` is stored in `cntl[i]`, and `cntl[0]` remains 0. The standard input `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The variable `i` now holds the value of the last integer in the list `a`.
