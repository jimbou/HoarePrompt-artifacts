Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least three elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index 0 is 1, the element at index 1 is 1, the element at index 2 is 3, and all other elements are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the third element in `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cntl` at index `i` (which is the third element in `a`) has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
