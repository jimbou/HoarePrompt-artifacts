Output State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `n` is the first element of `qs`**

The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so we can't determine its exact output. However, we know that `n` is the first element of `qs` and `p` is a list of positive integers. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
