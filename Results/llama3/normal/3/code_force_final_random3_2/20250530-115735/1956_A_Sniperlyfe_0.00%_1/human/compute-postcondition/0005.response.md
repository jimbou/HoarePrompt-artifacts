The `print` statement is printing the elements of the `res` list, which contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`. Since the exact definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact values in the `res` list. However, based on the precondition, we know that `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is a positive integer and `p` is a list of positive integers.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, p) (where n is the first integer in the list and p is a list of positive integers)**
