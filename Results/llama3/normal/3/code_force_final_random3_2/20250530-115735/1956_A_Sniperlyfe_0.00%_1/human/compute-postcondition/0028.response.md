The `print` statement will print the elements of the `res` list as a string of space-separated integers.

The `res` list contains the results of `func_1(n, p)`, `func_1(n, p)`, and `func_1(n, p)` where `n` is the third element of `qs`. Since the exact values of `n` and `p` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the results. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the results of these function calls as a string of space-separated integers.

Output: **the results of func_1(n, p), func_1(n, p), and func_1(n, p) where n is the third element of qs, as a string of space-separated integers**
