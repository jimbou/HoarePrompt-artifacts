Based on the precondition, we can determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

The `res` list contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice. Since the result of `func_1(n, p)` is being printed as a string of space-separated integers, we can infer that `func_1(n, p)` returns a list of integers.

The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate the elements of the `res` list into a single string, separated by spaces. The `map` function is used to convert each integer in the `res` list to a string before joining them.

Therefore, the output will be a string of space-separated integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice.

Output: **a string of space-separated integers, where each integer is the result of func_1(n, p) repeated twice**
