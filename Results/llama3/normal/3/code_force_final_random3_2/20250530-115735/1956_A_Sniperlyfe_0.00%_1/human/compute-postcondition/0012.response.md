Output State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` is being printed as a string of space-separated integers, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times is being printed as a string of space-separated integers, `n` is the third integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times. The other variables remain unchanged. The result of `func_1(n, p)` is still being printed as a string of space-separated integers, and the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times is also being printed as a string of space-separated integers. The value of `n` is still the third integer in the list.
