Output State: **k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of positive integers, qs is an empty list, res is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs, t is an integer greater than 1, stdin is empty, and the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs are printed as a string of space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the list `qs` is now empty. The list `res` contains the results of the function `func_1(n, p)` for all elements `n` that were initially in `qs`. The results of these function calls have been printed as a string of space-separated integers. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the standard input `stdin` is still empty.
