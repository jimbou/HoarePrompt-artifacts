Output: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` including the third element in the list `qs` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` for the third element `n` in the list `qs`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `n` is the third element in the list `qs`, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers, and this is printed: "a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs`", and a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` is printed, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers**
