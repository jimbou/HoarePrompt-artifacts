The code prints a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs`, including the third element in the list `qs` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` for the third element `n` in the list `qs`.
Output: **a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs`**
