The `print` statement will print the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` as a string of space-separated integers.

Since `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the first element in the list `qs`, the output will be the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the first element in `qs`.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, p) for the first element in qs (where n is the first element in the list qs and p is the list of positive integers)**
