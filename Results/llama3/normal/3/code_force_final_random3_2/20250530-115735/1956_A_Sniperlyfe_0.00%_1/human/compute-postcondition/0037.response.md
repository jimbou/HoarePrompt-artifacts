To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for n in qs:`, so we can only adjust the states of `n` and `qs`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If the list `qs` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` has at least one element, and `n` is the first element in the list `qs`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least one more element, and `n` must be the next element in the list `qs`. Since `n` is the first element in the list `qs` at the end of the last iteration, it must be the second element in the list `qs` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `n` is the second element in the list `qs`, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers, and this is printed: "a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs`"**
