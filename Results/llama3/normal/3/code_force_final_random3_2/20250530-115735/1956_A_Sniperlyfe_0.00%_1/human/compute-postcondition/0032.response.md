Output State: **k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of positive integers, qs is a list of integers, res is an empty list, t is an integer greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the updated qs are printed as a string of space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `res`, `t`, and `stdin` are updated according to the code snippet. The `k` and `q` variables are assigned integer values from the input, `p` and `qs` are assigned lists of integers from the input, and `res` is initialized as an empty list. The `t` variable remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0, and `stdin` is empty. Additionally, the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers.
