According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n` and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n` and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer greater than 0**
