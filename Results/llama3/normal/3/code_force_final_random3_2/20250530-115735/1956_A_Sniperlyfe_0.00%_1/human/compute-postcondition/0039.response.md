Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs`.
* `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.
* `n` is the second element in the list `qs`.
* The results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers.

Since the exact values of `qs` and `p` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the results. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs`.

Output: **a string of space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs`**
