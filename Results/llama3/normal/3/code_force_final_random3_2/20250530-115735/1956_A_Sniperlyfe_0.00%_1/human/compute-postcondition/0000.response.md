Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n` and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer**.

In this output state, the value of `n` and the properties of the list `p` remain unchanged. The code only adds a new variable `t` which is assigned the value of an integer input from the user. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to accept the input for `t`.
