Output State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` where `n` is the second element of `qs`, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated by appending the result of `func_1(n, p)` to its original value, which already contained the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
