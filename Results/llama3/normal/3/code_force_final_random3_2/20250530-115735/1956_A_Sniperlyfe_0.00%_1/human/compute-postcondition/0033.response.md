To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `n` and the list `qs`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If the list `qs` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `qs` is a list of integers, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `qs` must have at least 1 element and `n` is the first element in the list `qs`.

State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is an empty list, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `n` is the first element in the list `qs`, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers.**
