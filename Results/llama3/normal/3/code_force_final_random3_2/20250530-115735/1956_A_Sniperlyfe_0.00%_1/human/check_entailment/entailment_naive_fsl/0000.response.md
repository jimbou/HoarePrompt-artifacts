Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `p`, where `n` is the number of players and `p` is the list of positions to be removed. The function simulates the game by repeatedly removing players at the specified positions until no more players can be removed. The remaining number of players is then returned.

`func_2` is the main function that reads the input, calls `func_1` for each query, and prints the results. The program correctly handles the game simulation and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the game simulation, and the output matches the expected results for the given test cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
