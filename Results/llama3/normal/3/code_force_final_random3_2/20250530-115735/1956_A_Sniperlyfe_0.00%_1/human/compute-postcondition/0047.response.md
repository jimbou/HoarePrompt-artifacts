Functionality: **The function reads a series of inputs from the user, including a number of test cases, a pair of integers (k and q), a sorted list of positive integers (p), and a list of query integers (qs). It then iterates over each query integer, calls another function (func_1) with the query integer and the list of positive integers as arguments, appends the result to a list (res), and prints the list of results as a string of space-separated integers. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty and the query list empty, with the results of the function calls stored in the result list.**
