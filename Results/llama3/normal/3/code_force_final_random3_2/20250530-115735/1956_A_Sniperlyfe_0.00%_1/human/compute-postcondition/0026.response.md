To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for n in qs:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `n` and `qs`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `qs` has at least 2 elements, and `n` is the second element of `qs`. For the loop to execute again, `qs` must have at least one more element, and `n` must be the next element in the list.

State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` where `n` is the third element of `qs`, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` and `func_1(n, p)` where `n` is the third element of `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers**
