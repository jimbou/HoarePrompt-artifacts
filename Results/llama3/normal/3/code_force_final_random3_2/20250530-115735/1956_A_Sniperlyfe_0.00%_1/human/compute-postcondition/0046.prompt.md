Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that all elements in `p` are less than or equal to `n` and `p` is sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has finished executing, and the output state is as follows: `n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that has been exhausted, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each integer in `qs`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, and `stdin` is empty. The result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each integer in `qs` is being printed as a string of space-separated integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of positive integers, qs is an empty list, res is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs, t is an integer greater than 1, stdin is empty, and the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs are printed as a string of space-separated integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of positive integers, qs is an empty list, res is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs, t is an integer greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs are printed as a string of space-separated integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
