Output State: **k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of positive integers, qs is an empty list, res is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs, t is 0, stdin is empty, and the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs are printed as a string of space-separated integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows: the variables k and q are integers, p is a list of positive integers, qs is an empty list, res is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs, t is 0 (indicating that the loop has finished executing), stdin is empty (indicating that all input has been processed), and the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs are printed as a string of space-separated integers.
