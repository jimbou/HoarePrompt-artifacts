Output State: **`k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `n` is the first element in the list `qs`, and the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers.**

The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`, where `n` is the first element in the list `qs`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the updated `qs` are printed as a string of space-separated integers.
