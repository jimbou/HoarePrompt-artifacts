To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that takes on the value of each iteration in the range `t`. However, since `_` is not used in the loop body, we can ignore it.

The only other variable that affects the loop execution is `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is in the range `t`. Since the loop has finished executing, it means that `_` has reached the end of the range `t`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increase the value of `t` by 1.

State: **`n` is the last integer in the list `qs`, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `p` is a list of positive integers, `qs` is a list of integers that has been exhausted, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated for each integer in `qs`, `t` is an integer greater than 1, and `stdin` is empty.**
