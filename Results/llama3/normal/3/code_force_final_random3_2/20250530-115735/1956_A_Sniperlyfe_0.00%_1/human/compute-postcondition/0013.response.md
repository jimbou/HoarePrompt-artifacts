Based on the precondition, the `res` list contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times. Since `n` is the third integer in the list `qs`, and `p` is a list of positive integers, the result of `func_1(n, p)` is a string of space-separated integers.

When the `print` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the `res` list as a string of space-separated integers. Since `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times, the output will be a string of space-separated integers, where each group of integers is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where [result of func_1(n, p)] is a string of space-separated integers)**
