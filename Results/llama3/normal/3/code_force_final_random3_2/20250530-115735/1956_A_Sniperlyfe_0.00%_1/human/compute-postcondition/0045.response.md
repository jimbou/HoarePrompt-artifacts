Output State: **k is an integer, q is an integer, p is a list of positive integers, qs is an empty list, res is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs, t is an integer greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the results of func_1(n, p) for all n in the initial qs are printed as a string of space-separated integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the list `qs` is now empty. The list `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the initial `qs`. The results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the initial `qs` have been printed as a string of space-separated integers. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `t` remain unchanged, and `stdin` is still empty.
