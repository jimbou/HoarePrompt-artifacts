Postcondition: ***m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is either 0 or n - 2, mi is the position of the first 'B' character in the string s, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character, c is n, d is 2, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the second-to-last character in the string s. If j is 'B', then ma is n - 2, otherwise ma is 0.***
