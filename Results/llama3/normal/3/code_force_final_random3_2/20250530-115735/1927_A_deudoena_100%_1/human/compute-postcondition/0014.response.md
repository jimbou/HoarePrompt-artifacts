Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is the position of the first 'B' character in the string s, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, c is n, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variable `mi` now holds the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`. The variable `c` has been incremented to the length of the string `s`, which is `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
