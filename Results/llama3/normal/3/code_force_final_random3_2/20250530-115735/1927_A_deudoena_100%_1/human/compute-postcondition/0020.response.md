To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for j in s[::-1]:`, which means we're iterating over the string `s` in reverse order.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following states:

* `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4
* `ma` is either 0 or `n - 1`
* `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`
* `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character
* `c` is `n`
* `d` is 1
* `l` is an empty list
* `stdin` contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10), then a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character
* `j` is the last character in the string `s`. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is `n - 1`, otherwise `ma` is 0

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head. The only object in the loop head is `j`, which is the character being iterated over in the reversed string `s`.

Since we're iterating over the string in reverse order, the next character `j` will be the second-to-last character in the original string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be the second-to-last character in the string `s`.

Additionally, since `j` is now the second-to-last character, we need to update the state of `ma` accordingly. If the second-to-last character is 'B', then `ma` should be `n - 2`, otherwise `ma` should be 0.

The other states remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the loop head.

State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or `n - 2`, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character, `c` is `n`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10), then a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `j` is the second-to-last character in the string `s`. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is `n - 2`, otherwise `ma` is 0**
