Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or `n - 2`, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character, `c` is `n`, `d` is 2, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10), then a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `j` is the second-to-last character in the string `s`. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is `n - 2`, otherwise `ma` is 0**

The value of `d` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case.
