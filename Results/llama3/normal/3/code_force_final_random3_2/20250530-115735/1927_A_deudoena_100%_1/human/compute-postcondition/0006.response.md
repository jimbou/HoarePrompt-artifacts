To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in s:`. The only object in the loop head is `j` and `s`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, `j` is the first character in the string `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must have at least 2 characters and `j` must be the second character in the string `s`.

State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 1 if the first character of the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 0, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters that must have at least 2 characters, c is 1, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the second character in the string s.**
