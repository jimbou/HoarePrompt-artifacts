Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains only one 'B' character. In this case, the function `func_1()` returns 2, but the correct answer is 1.

For example, if the input is:

1
B

The program outputs 2, but the correct output is 1.

The issue is in the line `return ma - mi + 2`, where the program always adds 2 to the result, regardless of the actual length of the segment. This is incorrect when the segment has a length of 1.

To fix this issue, the program should return `ma - mi + 1` instead of `ma - mi + 2`.
