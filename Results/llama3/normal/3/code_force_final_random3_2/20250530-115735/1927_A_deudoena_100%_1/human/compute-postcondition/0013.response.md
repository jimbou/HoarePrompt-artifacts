Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters that must have at least 3 characters, `c` is 3, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10), then a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. If the third character `j` in the string `s` is 'B', then `mi` is 3. Otherwise, `mi` is 2 if the third character of the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 1 if the first character of the string `s` is 'B', otherwise `mi` is 0.***
