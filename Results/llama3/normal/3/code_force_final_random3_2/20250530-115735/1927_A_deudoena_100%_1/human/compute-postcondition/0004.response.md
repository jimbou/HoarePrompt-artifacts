Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 1, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters that must have at least 1 character, c is 1, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the first character in the string s, and the current value of j is 'B'.**

The code assigns the value of `c` to `mi`, making `mi` equal to 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
