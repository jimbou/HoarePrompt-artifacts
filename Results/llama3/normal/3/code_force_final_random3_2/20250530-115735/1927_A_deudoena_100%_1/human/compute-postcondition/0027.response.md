Postcondition: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `s` is a string that must have more characters for another iteration, `c` is `n`, `d` is 3, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple inputs as described. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is set to `len(s) - 3` and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`. Otherwise, `ma` is either 0 or `n - 2` and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`.**
