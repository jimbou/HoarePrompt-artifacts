Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 1 if the first character of the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 0, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters that must have at least 2 characters, c is 2, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the second character in the string s.**

In this output state, the value of c has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case, and the string s still has at least 2 characters, with at least one 'B' character. The second character in the string s is still represented by j.
