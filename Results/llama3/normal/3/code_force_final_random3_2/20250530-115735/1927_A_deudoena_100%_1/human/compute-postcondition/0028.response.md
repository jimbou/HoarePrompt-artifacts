Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is either 0 or n - d, mi is the position of the first 'B' character in the string s, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character, c is n, d is n, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the first character in the string s. If j is 'B', then ma is 0, otherwise ma is n - d.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate over the string `s` from the end to the beginning. In each iteration, it increments the counter `d` and checks if the current character `j` is 'B'. If `j` is 'B', it sets `ma` to the position of the last 'B' character in the string `s` (which is `len(s) - d`) and breaks out of the loop. If `j` is not 'B', it continues to the next iteration.

After the loop finishes executing all iterations, the output state will be:

* `m` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4.
* `ma` is either 0 (if the last character in the string `s` is not 'B') or `n - d` (if the last character in the string `s` is 'B').
* `mi` is still the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`.
* `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character.
* `c` is still `n`.
* `d` is now `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over the entire string `s`.
* `l` is still an empty list.
* `stdin` still contains multiple inputs as described.
* `j` is now the first character in the string `s`.

Note that the loop will break out of the loop as soon as it finds the first 'B' character from the end of the string `s`, so `ma` will be set to the position of the last 'B' character in the string `s`.
