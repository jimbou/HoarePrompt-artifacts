The only object in the loop head is variable  j and string s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string s.  If the string s has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, s has at least 2 characters, j is the second character in the string s. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string s must have at least 3 characters and the j is the third character in the string s.
State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 2 if the third character of the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 1 if the first character of the string s is 'B', otherwise mi is 0, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters that must have at least 3 characters, c is 2, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the third character in the string s.**
