Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is the position of the first 'B' character in the string s, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, c is n, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
Code of the loop:
for j in s[::-1]:
    d += 1
    if j == 'B':
        ma = len(s) - d
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is either 0 or `n - 1`, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character, `c` is `n`, `d` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10), then a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `j` is the last character in the string `s`. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is `n - 1`, otherwise `ma` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is either 0 or n - 2, mi is the position of the first 'B' character in the string s, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character, c is n, d is 2, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the second-to-last character in the string s. If j is 'B', then ma is n - 2, otherwise ma is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `s` is a string that must have more characters for another iteration, `c` is `n`, `d` is 3, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple inputs as described. If `j` is 'B', then `ma` is set to `len(s) - 3` and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`. Otherwise, `ma` is either 0 or `n - 2` and `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
