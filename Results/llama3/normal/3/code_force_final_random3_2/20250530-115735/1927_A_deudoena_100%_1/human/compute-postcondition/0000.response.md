Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 0, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, c is 0, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**

The code snippet reads an integer `m` from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4. It then reads a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. The variables `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0, and `c` and `d` are also initialized to 0. An empty list `l` is created. The values of `m` and `s` are determined by the input, while the other variables are initialized to their specified values.
