According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, we can adjust the state of `s` to ensure it has at least one character.

State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first 'B' character in the string `s`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character, `c` is `n`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10), then a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `j` is the last character in the string `s`**
