The function takes no arguments and returns the length of the shortest substring of 'B' characters in a given string of 'W' and 'B' characters, plus 2. It reads input from stdin, where the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) representing the length of the string, and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. The function returns the length of the shortest substring of 'B' characters in the string s, plus 2, for each test case.
