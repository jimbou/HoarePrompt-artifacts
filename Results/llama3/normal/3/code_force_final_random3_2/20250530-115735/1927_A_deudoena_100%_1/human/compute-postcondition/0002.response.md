Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is 0, mi is 0, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters that must have at least 1 character, c is 1, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the first character in the string s**

The code increments the value of `c` by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after the increment, `c` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case, with the first input being an integer `n` and the second input being a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. The value of `j` is still the first character in the string `s`.
