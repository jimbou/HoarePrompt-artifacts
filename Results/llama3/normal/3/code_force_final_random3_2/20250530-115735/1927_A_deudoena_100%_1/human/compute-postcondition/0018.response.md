Output State: **m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, ma is n - 1, mi is the position of the first 'B' character in the string s, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one character, c is n, d is 1, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10), then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, j is the last character in the string s and is 'B'.**

The code assigns the value of `len(s) - d` to `ma`. Since `d` is 1, `ma` becomes `n - 1`. No other variables are affected.
