Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count is larger than 0, then if s[j] is equal to x, count2 is increased by 1. If count2 is less than count, then done is True. If count2 is not less than count, then done is True if count is larger than 1. If count is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is undefined and done is True.***
