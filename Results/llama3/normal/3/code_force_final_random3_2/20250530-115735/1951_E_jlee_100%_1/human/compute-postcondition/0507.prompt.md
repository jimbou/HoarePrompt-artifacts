Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s, count is 0, count2 is 0, done is False, string is the input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 1, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 0. If count is greater than 0, then if the character at index j of s is not the same as the first character of s, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the string is split into two substrings from the beginning to j-1 and from j to the end, and done is set to True. If the character at index j of s is the same as the first character of s, then count2 is 1, and done is True. If count is not greater than 0, then no changes are made to count, count2, and done.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 2, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 1. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 is less than count, done is True and count is less than 1. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True and count is less than 1. Otherwise, if the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s, then count is 1 and done is False. If the character at index j in s is equal to the character at index n-1-j in s, then count is 0 and done is True. If count2 is greater than count, then the program prints 'YES', the number 2, the first character of the string, and the rest of the string starting from the second character, and sets done to True. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s and count is less than 1, then count is set to 1 and done is set to False. Otherwise, no action is taken. If count is not greater than 0, then if the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s and count is less than 1, then count is set to 1 and done is set to False. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 3, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 2. If count > 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first 2 characters of the input string and the rest of the input string are being printed, done is True, count is 2. If count2 is not less than count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True and count is 0. If count is less than or equal to 1, then if the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - j in s, then count is 2 and done is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - j in s and count is less than 1, then count is 2 and done is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If count is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
