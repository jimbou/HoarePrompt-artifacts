Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 1, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 0. If the first and last characters of s are not the same, then the current value of count is 0, count2 is 0 and done is True. Otherwise, the current value of count is less than 1, and the current value of s[j] is not equal to x.***
