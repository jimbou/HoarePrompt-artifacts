Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If the jth character of s is not equal to the (n-1-j)th character of s and count is less than 1, then done is set to True and count is set to j. Otherwise, done is set to False if the jth character of s is equal to the (n-1-j)th character of s, otherwise no action is taken, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j-1 and both parts are printed**
