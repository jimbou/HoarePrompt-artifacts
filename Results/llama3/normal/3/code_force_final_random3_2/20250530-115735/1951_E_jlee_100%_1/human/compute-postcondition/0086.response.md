Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s, count is greater than 0, count2 is 0, j is 0. If count2 is less than count, then done is True, 'YES' was printed, 2 was printed, the first j characters of the string were printed and the rest of the string starting from the jth character was printed. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. If count is less than or equal to 1, then count2 is 0. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first j characters of string and the rest of the string are printed. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x.***
