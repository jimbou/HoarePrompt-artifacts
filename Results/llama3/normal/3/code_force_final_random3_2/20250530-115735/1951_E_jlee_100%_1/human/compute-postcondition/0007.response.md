Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, done is False, stdin is empty. If n is equal to 1, 'NO' is printed and the next iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
