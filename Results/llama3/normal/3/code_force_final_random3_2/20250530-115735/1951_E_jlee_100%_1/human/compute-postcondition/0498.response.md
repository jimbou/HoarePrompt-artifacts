Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Here, `string` is the input string, and `j` is an integer with a value of 2.

The expression `string[:j]` means "get all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j`". Since `j` is 2, this will get the first 2 characters of the string.

The expression `string[j:]` means "get all characters from the character at index `j` to the end of the string". Since `j` is 2, this will get all characters from the 3rd character to the end of the string.

So, the print statement will print the first 2 characters of the input string, followed by all characters from the 3rd character to the end of the string.

Output: **the first 2 characters of the input string, followed by all characters from the 3rd character to the end of the input string**
