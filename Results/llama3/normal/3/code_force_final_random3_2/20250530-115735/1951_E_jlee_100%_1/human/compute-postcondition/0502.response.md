Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 3, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 2. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True and count is 0. If count is less than or equal to 1, then if the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - j in s, then count is 2 and done is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If count2 is not equal to count, then if count2 is greater than count, done is True, count is 2, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first two characters of the string are printed followed by the rest of the string. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
