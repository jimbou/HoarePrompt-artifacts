The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0, n is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 and n must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s, j is 1**
