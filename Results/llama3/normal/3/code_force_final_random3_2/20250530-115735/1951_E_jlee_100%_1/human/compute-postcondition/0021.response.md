Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` is not equal to 1, `x` is equal to the last character of `s`, the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n`, 'NO' is being printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration, without changing any variable values.
