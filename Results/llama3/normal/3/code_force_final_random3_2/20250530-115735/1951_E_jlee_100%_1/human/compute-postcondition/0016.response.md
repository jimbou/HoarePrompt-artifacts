Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`, 'YES' is being printed, the value 1 is being printed, and the string from stdin which is `string` is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The printing of 'YES', 1, and the string from stdin is still being executed.
