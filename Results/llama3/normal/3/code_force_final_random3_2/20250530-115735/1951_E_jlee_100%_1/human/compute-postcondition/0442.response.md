Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `j` is 1, which means we are considering the first character of the string `s`.
* `string[:j]` will print the substring from the beginning of the string to the index `j-1`, which is the first character of the string.
* `string[j:]` will print the substring from the index `j` to the end of the string, which is the rest of the string.

Since `j` is 1, the first character of the string is included in the first part of the print statement (`string[:j]`), and the rest of the string is included in the second part of the print statement (`string[j:]`).

Therefore, the output will be the first character of the string, followed by the rest of the string.

Output: **the first character of the string, followed by the rest of the string**
