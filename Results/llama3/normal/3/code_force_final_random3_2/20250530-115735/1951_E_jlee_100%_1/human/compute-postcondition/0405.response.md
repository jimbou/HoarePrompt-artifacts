Based on the precondition, let's analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `string`: This is the input string.
* `j`: This is an integer with a value of 0.

The print statement is `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, when you use a negative index in slicing, it counts from the end of the string. So, `string[:j - 1]` is equivalent to `string[:-1]`, which means "all characters except the last one".

`string[j - 1:]` is equivalent to `string[-1:]`, which means "the last character".

Since `j` is 0, `string[j - 1:]` will print the last character of the string, and `string[:j - 1]` will print all characters except the last one.

Output: **all characters of the string except the last one, the last character of the string**
