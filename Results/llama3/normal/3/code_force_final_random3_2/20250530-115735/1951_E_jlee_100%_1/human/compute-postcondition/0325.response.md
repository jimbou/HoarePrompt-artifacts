Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 2, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 1, then done is True, count is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to x if such a character exists and count is less than 1, otherwise count remains unchanged, the string is split into two substrings at the index j-1 where j is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to x if such a character exists and count is less than 1, otherwise the string remains unchanged, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed. If count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0, done is True if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, otherwise done remains unchanged.**
