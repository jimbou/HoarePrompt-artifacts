Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0. If the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, then `done` is set to True. Otherwise, `done` remains False.***
