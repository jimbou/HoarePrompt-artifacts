Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is undefined and done is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
