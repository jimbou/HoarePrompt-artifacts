Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, and the input string which is stored in the variable `string` is being printed. If the first character `x` of the string is not equal to the last character of the string, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
