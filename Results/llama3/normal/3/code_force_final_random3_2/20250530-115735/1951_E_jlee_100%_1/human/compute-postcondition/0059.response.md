Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`. This statement is printing two parts of the string: the substring from the beginning of the string to the index `j` (inclusive), and the substring from the index `j` to the end of the string.

From the precondition, we know that `j` is 0, which means that the first substring `string[:j]` is an empty string.

The second substring `string[j:]` starts from the index `j` (which is 0) and goes to the end of the string. Since `j` is 0, this substring is the entire string.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the entire string, followed by an empty string.

Output: **the entire string, followed by an empty string**
