Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s, count is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to x if such a character exists and count is less than 1, otherwise count remains unchanged, count2 is the number of characters in s that are equal to x, done is False, string is the input string. If the count of x in s is equal to n - 1, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
