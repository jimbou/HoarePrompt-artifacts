Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 2, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 1, count is 1, done is False**

The code block does not modify the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `n`, `x`, or `string`, so they remain the same. The variable `j` is also not modified, so it remains 1. The variable `count` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1. The `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The variable `done` is not modified in this code block, so it remains False.
