Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 1, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 0. If count is greater than 0, then if the character at index j of s is not the same as the first character of s, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the string is split into two substrings from the beginning to j-1 and from j to the end, and done is set to True. If the character at index j of s is the same as the first character of s, then count2 is 1, and done is True. If count is not greater than 0, then no changes are made to count, count2, and done.***
