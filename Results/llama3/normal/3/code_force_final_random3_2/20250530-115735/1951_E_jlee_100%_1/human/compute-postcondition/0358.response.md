Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s, count is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to x if such a character exists and count is less than 1, otherwise count remains unchanged, count2 is the number of characters in s that are equal to x, done is False, string is the input string. If the first character of the string is not equal to the last character of the string, 'YES' is printed, the number 1 is printed, and the input string is printed, and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
