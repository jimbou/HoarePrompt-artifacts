Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s, count is greater than 0, j is 0. If count2 is equal to count, then count2 is equal to count if count is greater than 1, otherwise count2 is 0, and done is True if count is greater than 1, otherwise done is False. If count2 is greater than count, then done is set to True. Otherwise, done remains unchanged.**
