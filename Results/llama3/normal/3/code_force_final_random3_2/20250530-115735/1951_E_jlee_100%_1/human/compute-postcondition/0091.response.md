The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s.**
