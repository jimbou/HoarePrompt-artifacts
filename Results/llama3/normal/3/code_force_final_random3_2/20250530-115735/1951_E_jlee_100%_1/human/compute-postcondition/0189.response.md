Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and the input string which is stored in the variable `string` is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration, so the values of the variables remain the same. The only change is that we move to the next iteration of the loop.
