Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count2 is equal to count, then if count > 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first j - 1 characters of the string are printed, and the characters of the string from index j - 1 to the end are printed. Otherwise, count2 is 0, and done is True if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, otherwise done remains unchanged. If count2 is not equal to count, then done is True. Otherwise, the values of t, i, s, n, x, and done remain unchanged.***
