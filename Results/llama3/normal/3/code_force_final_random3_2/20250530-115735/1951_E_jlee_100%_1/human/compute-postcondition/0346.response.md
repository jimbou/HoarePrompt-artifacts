Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the string 'NO'.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The precondition states that `done` is False, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
* The print statement simply prints the string 'NO', without any variables or expressions.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'NO', without any additional information or values.

Output: **NO**
