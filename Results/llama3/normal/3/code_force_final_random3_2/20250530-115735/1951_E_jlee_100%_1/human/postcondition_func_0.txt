This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It then checks if the string can be split into two substrings by removing at most one character, such that the resulting substrings are equal. If possible, it prints 'YES' and the number of characters to remove, followed by the modified string. If not possible, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.
