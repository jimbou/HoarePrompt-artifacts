Postcondition: **The program's state after executing the if-else block is as follows: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, n is the length of s and is at least 1, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, and j is 0. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the input string is split into two substrings from the beginning to j-1 and from j to the end, and done is set to True. If count is 1, count2 is set to 0. If count2 is greater than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed, the first part is an empty string since j is 0, and the second part is the entire string since j is 0, and done is True. In all cases, the character at index j of s is not the same as the first character of s.**
