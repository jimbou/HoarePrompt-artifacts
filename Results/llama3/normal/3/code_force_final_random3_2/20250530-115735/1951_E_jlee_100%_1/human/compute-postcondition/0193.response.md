Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, and `done` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.
