Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `string` is a string from stdin, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`. If `n` is equal to 1, 'NO' is printed and the next iteration of the loop is skipped. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, 'YES' is printed, the value 1 is printed, and the string from stdin which is `string` is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is equal to the last character of `s`, then if the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n`, 'NO' is printed and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration. If the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`, then if `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`, 'NO' was printed. Otherwise, 'YES' was printed, 1 was printed, and the string from stdin which is `string` was printed. We skip to the next iteration of the loop. If the count of `x` in `s` is not equal to `n - 1`, no action is taken.***
