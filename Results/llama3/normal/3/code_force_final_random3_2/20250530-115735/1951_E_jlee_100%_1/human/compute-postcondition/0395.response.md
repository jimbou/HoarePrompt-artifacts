The `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement will print two parts of the input string: the substring from the beginning of the string up to the index `j` (exclusive), and the substring from the index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `j` is 0, the first part of the string will be empty (`""`), and the second part will be the entire input string.

Output: **"" (empty string), (the entire input string)**
