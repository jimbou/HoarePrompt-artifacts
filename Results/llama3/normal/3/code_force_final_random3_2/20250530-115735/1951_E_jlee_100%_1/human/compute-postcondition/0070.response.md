Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s, count is greater than 1, count2 is equal to count, j is 0. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and this is printed: the substring of string from the beginning to the character before the current character (string[:j - 1]) and the substring of string from the current character to the end (string[j - 1:])**
