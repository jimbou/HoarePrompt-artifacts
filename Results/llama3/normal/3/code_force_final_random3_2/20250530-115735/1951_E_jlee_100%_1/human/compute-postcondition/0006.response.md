Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, string is a string from stdin, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s and equals 1, done is False, stdin is empty, 'NO' is being printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the program skips to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables, but it changes the control flow of the program, causing it to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one.
