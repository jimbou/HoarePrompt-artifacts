Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 1, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 0, count is greater than 0. If count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first j characters of the string which is empty and the rest of the string which is the input string are printed, and done is True. If count2 is greater than or equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the input string is split into two substrings from the beginning to j-1 and from j to the end, and done is set to True. If count is 1, count2 is set to 0. If count2 is greater than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed, the first part is an empty string since j is 0, and the second part is the entire string since j is 0, and done is True. In all cases, the character at index j of s is not the same as the first character of s.***
