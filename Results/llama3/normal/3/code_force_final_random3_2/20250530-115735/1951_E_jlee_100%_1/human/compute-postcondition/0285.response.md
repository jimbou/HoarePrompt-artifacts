Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count > 1, then 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first j - 1 characters of the string are printed, and the characters of the string from index j - 1 to the end are printed. Otherwise, count2 is 0, and done is True if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, otherwise done remains unchanged.***
