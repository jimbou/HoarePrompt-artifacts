Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 0, then if the current value of s[j] is not equal to the current value of x, then if count2 is less than count, done is True, 'YES' was printed, 2 was printed, the first j characters of the string were printed and the rest of the string starting from the jth character was printed. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. If count is less than or equal to 1, then count2 is 0. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first j characters of string and the rest of the string are printed. Otherwise, if the current value of s[j] is equal to the current value of x, then count2 is 1. If count is not greater than 0, then the values of the variables remain unchanged. If the current value of s[j] is not equal to the current value of s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. Otherwise, if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then the values of the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
