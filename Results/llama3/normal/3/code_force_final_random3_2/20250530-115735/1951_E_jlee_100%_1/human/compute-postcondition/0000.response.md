The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line of stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. 

Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains the remaining test cases, which are the strings `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6).**
