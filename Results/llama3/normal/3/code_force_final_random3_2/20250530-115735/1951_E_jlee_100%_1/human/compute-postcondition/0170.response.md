Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, the function prints 'YES', 2, the first j characters of the string, and the rest of the string from index j to the end, and sets done to True and count to 0. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If the jth character of s is not equal to the (n-1-j)th character of s and count is less than 1, then done is set to True and count is set to j. Otherwise, done is set to False if the jth character of s is equal to the (n-1-j)th character of s, otherwise no action is taken. If count is not greater than 0, then no action is taken.**
