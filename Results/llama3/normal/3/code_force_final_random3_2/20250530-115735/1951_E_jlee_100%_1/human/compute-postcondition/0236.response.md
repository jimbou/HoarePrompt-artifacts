Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s, count is greater than 1, count2 is equal to count, j is 0. The current value of count is greater than 1. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - j in s, then done is set to True. Otherwise, done remains False. If the character at index j in s is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then done is False. Otherwise, done remains unchanged. The current value of s[j] is not equal to x. and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed**
