The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n. If j is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1, n is at least 2. For the loop to execute again j is increased by 1 so j is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 3, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 2**
