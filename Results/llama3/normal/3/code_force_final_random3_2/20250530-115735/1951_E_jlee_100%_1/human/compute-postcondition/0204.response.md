Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is False. If the first character `x` of the string is not equal to the last character of the string, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n - 1`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
