Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 2, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 0, then if count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed, and done is True. If count2 is not less than count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True, count is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to x if such a character exists and count is less than 1, otherwise count remains unchanged, the string is split into two substrings at the index j-1 where j is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to x if such a character exists and count is less than 1, otherwise the string remains unchanged, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed. If count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0, done is True if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, otherwise done remains unchanged. If count2 is not equal to count, then done is True. Otherwise, count2 is increased by 1 if s[j] is equal to x. If count is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
