Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True and count is 0. Otherwise, count2 is 0, done is either True or False depending on the value of count and the characters in s, and count is either less than 1 or equal to j depending on the value of done and the characters in s. If count2 is not equal to count, then if count2 is greater than count, done is set to True and count is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of done and count remain unchanged.***
