Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string, n is the length of s, x is the first character of s, count is 0, count2 is 0, done is False.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 0, then the following conditions apply: If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - j in s, then done is set to True. Otherwise, done remains False. If the character at index j in s is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then done is False. Otherwise, done remains unchanged. If s[j] is not equal to x, then done is True if count2 is less than count, or if count2 is equal to count and count is greater than 1, or if count2 is greater than count. Otherwise, done is False if count2 is equal to count and count is 1. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is 1. If count is not greater than 0, then the conditions of the else part apply (which are not specified).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count > 0, then if count2 is less than count, t, i, s, n, x, and done remain unchanged. If count2 is equal to count, then if count > 1, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, the first j - 1 characters of the string are printed, and the characters of the string from index j - 1 to the end are printed. Otherwise, count2 is 0, and done is True if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, otherwise done remains unchanged. If count2 is not equal to count, then done is True. Otherwise, the values of t, i, s, n, x, and done remain unchanged. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is set to j and done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made. If count is 0, then the values of t, i, s, n, x, and done remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 2, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 0, then if count2 is less than count, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the string is split into two parts at index j and both parts are printed, and done is True. If count2 is not less than count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True, count is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to x if such a character exists and count is less than 1, otherwise count remains unchanged, the string is split into two substrings at the index j-1 where j is the index of the first character in s that is not equal to x if such a character exists and count is less than 1, otherwise the string remains unchanged, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed. If count is not greater than 1, then count2 is 0, done is True if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, otherwise done remains unchanged. If count2 is not equal to count, then done is True. Otherwise, count2 is increased by 1 if s[j] is equal to x. If count is not greater than 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
