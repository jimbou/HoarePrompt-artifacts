Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 3, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 2. If count is greater than 1, then done is True and count is 0. If count is less than or equal to 1, then if the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - j in s, then count is 2 and done is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
