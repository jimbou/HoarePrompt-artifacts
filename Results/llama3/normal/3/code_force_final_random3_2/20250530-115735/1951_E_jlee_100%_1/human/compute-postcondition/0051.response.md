Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s, count is 0, count2 is 0, j is 0. If the current value of s[j] is not equal to the current value of s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. Otherwise, if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then the values of the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
