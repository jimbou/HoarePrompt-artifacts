Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 2, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 1. If count is greater than 1, then done is True and count is less than 1. Otherwise, if the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s, then count is 1 and done is False. If the character at index j in s is equal to the character at index n-1-j in s, then count is 0 and done is True.**
