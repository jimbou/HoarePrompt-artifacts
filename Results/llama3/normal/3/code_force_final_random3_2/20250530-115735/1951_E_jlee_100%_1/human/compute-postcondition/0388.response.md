Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 1, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 0. If the first character of s is not the same as the character at index j and count is less than 1, then the current value of count is 0, count2 is 0 and done is True. Otherwise, no changes are made to count, count2, and done. The current value of count is greater than 0.**
