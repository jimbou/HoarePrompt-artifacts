Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string, n is the length of s, done is False, x is the first character of s, count is 0, count2 is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 0, then if the current value of s[j] is not equal to the current value of x, then if count2 is less than count, done is True, 'YES' was printed, 2 was printed, the first j characters of the string were printed and the rest of the string starting from the jth character was printed. If count2 equals count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True. If count is less than or equal to 1, then count2 is 0. If count2 is greater than count, then done is True, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first j characters of string and the rest of the string are printed. Otherwise, if the current value of s[j] is equal to the current value of x, then count2 is 1. If count is not greater than 0, then the values of the variables remain unchanged. If the current value of s[j] is not equal to the current value of s[n - 1 - j], then done is True, 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed, and the string has been printed. Otherwise, if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then the values of the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count is larger than 0, then if s[j] is equal to x, count2 is increased by 1. If count2 is less than count, then done is True. If count2 is not less than count, then done is True if count is larger than 1. If count is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then count is undefined and done is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, the function prints 'YES', 2, the first j characters of the string, and the rest of the string from index j to the end, and sets done to True and count to 0. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If the jth character of s is not equal to the (n-1-j)th character of s and count is less than 1, then done is set to True and count is set to j. Otherwise, done is set to False if the jth character of s is equal to the (n-1-j)th character of s, otherwise no action is taken. If count is not greater than 0, then no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
