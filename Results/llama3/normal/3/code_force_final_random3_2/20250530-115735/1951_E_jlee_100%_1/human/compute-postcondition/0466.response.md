Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 2, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be at least 2, x is the first character of s, string is the input string, j is 1. If count is greater than 0, then if s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 is less than count, done is True and count is less than 1. If count2 is equal to count, then if count is greater than 1, done is True and count is less than 1. Otherwise, if the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s, then count is 1 and done is False. If the character at index j in s is equal to the character at index n-1-j in s, then count is 0 and done is True. If count2 is greater than count, then the program prints 'YES', the number 2, the first character of the string, and the rest of the string starting from the second character, and sets done to True. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s and count is less than 1, then count is set to 1 and done is set to False. Otherwise, no action is taken. If count is not greater than 0, then if the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n-1-j in s and count is less than 1, then count is set to 1 and done is set to False. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
