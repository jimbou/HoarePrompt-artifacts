Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, n must be greater than 0, x is the first character of s. If count is greater than 0, then the following conditions apply: If the character at index j in s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - j in s, then done is set to True. Otherwise, done remains False. If the character at index j in s is not equal to x and count is less than 1, then done is False. Otherwise, done remains unchanged. If s[j] is not equal to x, then done is True if count2 is less than count, or if count2 is equal to count and count is greater than 1, or if count2 is greater than count. Otherwise, done is False if count2 is equal to count and count is 1. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is 1. If count is not greater than 0, then the conditions of the else part apply (which are not specified).***
