Based on the initial state, the code `print(string)` will print the input string.

The `string` variable is described as the input string, which means it contains the original text that was provided as input to the program. The precondition does not specify the exact content of the input string, so we cannot provide a precise numerical value or a specific sequence of characters.

However, we can describe the output as the original input string, which is stored in the `string` variable.

Output: **the original input string (which is stored in the string variable)**
