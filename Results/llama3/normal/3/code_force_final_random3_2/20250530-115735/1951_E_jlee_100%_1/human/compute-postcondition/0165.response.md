Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If count2 is greater than count, then done is set to True and count is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of done and count remain unchanged.***
