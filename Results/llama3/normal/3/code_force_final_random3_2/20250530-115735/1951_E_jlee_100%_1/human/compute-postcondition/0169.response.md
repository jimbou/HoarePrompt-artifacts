Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, s is a list of characters from string that must have at least 1 character, n is the length of s and must be greater than 1, x is the first character of s. If s[j] is not equal to x, then if count2 is less than count, done is True, count is 0, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, the first j characters of the string are printed, and the rest of the string from index j to the end is printed. If count2 is not less than count, then if count2 is equal to count, done is True and count is 0 if count is greater than 1, otherwise count2 is 0, done is either True or False depending on the value of count and the characters in s, and count is either less than 1 or equal to j depending on the value of done and the characters in s. If count2 is greater than count, done is set to True and count is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of done and count remain unchanged. If s[j] is equal to x, then count2 is increased by 1. If the jth character of s is not equal to the (n-1-j)th character of s and count is less than 1, then done is set to True and count is set to j. Otherwise, done is set to False if the jth character of s is equal to the (n-1-j)th character of s, otherwise no action is taken.***
