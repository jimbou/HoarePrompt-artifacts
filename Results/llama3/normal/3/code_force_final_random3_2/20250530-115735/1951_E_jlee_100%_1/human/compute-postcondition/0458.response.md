Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `string` is the input string, which has at least 2 characters (since `n` is the length of `s` and `n` is at least 2).
* `j` is 1, which means we are considering the second character of the string (since indexing starts at 0).
* `string[:j]` will print the first character of the string (since `j` is 1), which is the same as the first character of `s`, denoted by `x`.
* `string[j:]` will print the rest of the string, starting from the second character (since `j` is 1).

Therefore, the output will be the first character of the string, followed by the rest of the string.

Output: **x (the first character of the string), followed by the rest of the string (excluding the first character)**
