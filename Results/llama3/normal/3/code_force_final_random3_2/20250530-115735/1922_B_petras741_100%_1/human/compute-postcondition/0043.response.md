Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range n. Then, a list eta is created containing all the indices j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, and eta_ln is the number of indices j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0. If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed, which is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6. Otherwise, the value of res is printed, which is the number of combinations of 3 elements from the value at index eta[0] in w plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln). If n is less than 3, the number 0 is printed.***
