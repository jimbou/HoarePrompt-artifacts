Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0**
