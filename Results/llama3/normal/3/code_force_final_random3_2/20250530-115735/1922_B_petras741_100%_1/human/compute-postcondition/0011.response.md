Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is n-1**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, stdin, and buffer as in the initial state. However, the list `q` will be updated such that the value at each index `w[j]` will be the count of how many times `w[j]` appears in the list `w` for all `j` in the range of `n`. The loop variable `j` will be `n-1` after the loop finishes executing.
