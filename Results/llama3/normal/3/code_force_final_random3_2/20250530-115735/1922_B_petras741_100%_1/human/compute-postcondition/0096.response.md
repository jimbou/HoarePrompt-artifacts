Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is equal to the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w`, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that `t` and `i` remain unchanged, `n` is still an integer greater than 0, `w` is still a list of integers, and `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each index `q[w[j]]` represents the frequency of the corresponding element `w[j]` in the list `w`. The stdin still contains `t-6` test cases, the buffer is still empty, and `j` has reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `w`.
