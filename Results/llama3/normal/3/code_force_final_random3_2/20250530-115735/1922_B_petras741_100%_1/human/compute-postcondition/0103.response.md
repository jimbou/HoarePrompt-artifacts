Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is equal to the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w`, `j` is 3, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list. If the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the values 0 and 3. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated based on the condition `q[j] > 0`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` now contains the values 0 and 3, otherwise it remains an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
