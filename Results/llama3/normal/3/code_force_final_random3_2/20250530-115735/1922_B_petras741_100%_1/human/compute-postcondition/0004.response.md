Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, and the buffer remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases. A new variable `q` is introduced, which is a list of n+1 zeros.
