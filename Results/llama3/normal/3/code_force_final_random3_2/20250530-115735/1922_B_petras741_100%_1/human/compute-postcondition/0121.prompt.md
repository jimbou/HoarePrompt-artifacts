Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is equal to the number of times w[j] appears in w, `j` is n+1, `res` is the number of combinations of 3 elements from the first value in eta, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta is a list containing all the values j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of values in eta, rho is the number of times the first value in eta appears in w, and eta_ln is more than 1
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is equal to the number of times w[j] appears in w, j is 1, res is the number of combinations of 3 elements from the first value in eta plus the number of combinations of 2 elements from the first value in eta times the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w, buffer is an empty list, eta is a list containing all the values j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w, stdin contains t-6 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is equal to the number of times w[j] appears in w, j is 2, res is the number of combinations of 3 elements from the first value in eta plus the number of combinations of 2 elements from the first value in eta times the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of combinations of 3 elements from the second value in eta plus the number of combinations of 2 elements from the second value in eta times the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w, buffer is an empty list, eta is a list containing all the values j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the second value in eta appears in w, stdin contains t-6 test cases

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is equal to the number of times w[j] appears in w, j is 3, res is the number of combinations of 3 elements from the first value in eta plus the number of combinations of 2 elements from the first value in eta times the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of combinations of 3 elements from the second value in eta plus the number of combinations of 2 elements from the second value in eta times the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of combinations of 3 elements from the third value in eta plus the number of combinations of 2 elements from the third value in eta times the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w, buffer is an empty list, eta is a list containing all the values j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the first value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the second value in eta appears in w plus the number of times the third value in eta appears in w, stdin contains t-7 test cases




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
