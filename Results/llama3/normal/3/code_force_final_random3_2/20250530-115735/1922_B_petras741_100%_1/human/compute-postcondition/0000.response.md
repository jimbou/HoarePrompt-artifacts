The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains t test cases, after this line, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The second line initializes an empty list called `buffer`.

Output State: **t is a non-negative integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n, then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. n and a_i are non-negative integers. 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, buffer is an empty list.**
