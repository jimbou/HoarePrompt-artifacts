Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads a list of integers from the standard input, splits them into individual integers using the `split()` method, converts each integer to an integer using the `int()` function, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `w`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The variable `i` also remains unchanged, as it is not used or modified by the code. The buffer remains empty, as no data is written to it. The standard input now contains `t-2` test cases, as two inputs have been read and processed.
