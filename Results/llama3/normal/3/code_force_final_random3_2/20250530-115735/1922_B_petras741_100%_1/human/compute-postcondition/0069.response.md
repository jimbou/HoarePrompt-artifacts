Output: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w and the rest are 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list, j is n, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of indices j where q[j] is greater than 0 and is equal to 1, rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w. The current value of eta_ln is 1, and the number of combinations of 3 elements from n elements which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 is being printed**
