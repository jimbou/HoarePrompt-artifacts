The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `buffer` is an empty list, `j` is 2, and if `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list that contains 1.**
