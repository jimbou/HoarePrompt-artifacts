The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a formula for calculating the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of `n` elements.

Since `n` is an integer, the expression will evaluate to an integer value. However, the exact value of `n` is not provided in the precondition, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the expression.

Output: **n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 (where n is an integer)**
