Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is equal to the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w`, `eta` is a list containing the value 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value 0, which is the current value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, and `q[j]` are still valid.
