The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the j is increased by 1 so j is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and `q[w[3]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is 3**
