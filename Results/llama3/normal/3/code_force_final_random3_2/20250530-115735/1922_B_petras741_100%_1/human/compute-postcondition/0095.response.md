Output State: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[j]]` is the number of occurrences of `w[j]` in `w` for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is `n`.

The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it increments the count of the corresponding element in the list `q` by 1. After all iterations, the list `q` will contain the frequency of each element in the list `w`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
