Output: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range n, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, j is n, eta is a list containing the only index j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is 1, and rho is the number of times the value at index eta[0] appears in w, which is the only index where q[j] is greater than 0, and the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is being printed, which is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6**
