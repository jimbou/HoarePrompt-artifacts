Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is n-1, `eta` is an empty list**

In this output state, a new variable `eta` is introduced and assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, and the buffer is still empty. The variable `j` is still n-1. The lists `w` and `q` maintain their original properties.
