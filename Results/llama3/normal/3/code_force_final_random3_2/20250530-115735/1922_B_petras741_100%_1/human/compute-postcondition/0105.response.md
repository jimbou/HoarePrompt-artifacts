The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is equal to the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w`, `j` is 4, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list. If the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the values 0 and 3. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
