Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is equal to the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w`, `j` is 4, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list. If the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the values 0, 3 and 4. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.***
