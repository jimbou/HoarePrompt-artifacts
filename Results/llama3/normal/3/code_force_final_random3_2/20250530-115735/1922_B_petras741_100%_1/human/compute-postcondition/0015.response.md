Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is 0, `eta` is a list containing the value 0, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated to include the value 0, which is the current value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, and the buffer is still empty. The value of `q[j]` is still greater than 0.
