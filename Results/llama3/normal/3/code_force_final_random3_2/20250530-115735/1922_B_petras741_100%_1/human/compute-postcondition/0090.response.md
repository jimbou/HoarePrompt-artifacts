Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where `q[w[0]]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[0]]` has been incremented by 1, while the other elements of `q` remain 0. The rest of the variables retain their initial values.
