Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2, the value at index `w[1]` is 1, the value at index `w[2]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is 2**

The value of `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is 2, `w[j]` is `w[2]`. The value at index `w[2]` in `q` is initially 0, so it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
