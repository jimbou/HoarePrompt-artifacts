Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` and the rest are 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is `n`, and `eta` is a list containing all the indices `j` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`, stdin, and buffer as in the initial state. The variable `j` will be equal to `n`, and the list `eta` will contain all the indices `j` where the value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.
