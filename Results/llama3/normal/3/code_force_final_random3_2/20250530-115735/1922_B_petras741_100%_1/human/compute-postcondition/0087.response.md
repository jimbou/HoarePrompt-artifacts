Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer from stdin, w is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is an empty list.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin contains t-6 test cases. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `w`. Since `w` was a list of integers, it is now updated with the new list of integers from stdin. No other variables are affected.
