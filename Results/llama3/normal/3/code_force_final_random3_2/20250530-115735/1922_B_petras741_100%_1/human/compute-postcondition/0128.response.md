Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is equal to the number of times w[j] appears in w, j is n+1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta is a list containing all the values j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of values in eta, rho is the number of times the first value in eta appears in w. If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed, which is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6. If eta_ln is not 1, a complex calculation involving combinations and the number of times the first value in eta appears in w is performed for each value in eta, and the results are summed up.***
