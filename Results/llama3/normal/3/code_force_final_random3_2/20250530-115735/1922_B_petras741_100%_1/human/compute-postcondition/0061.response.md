Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `buffer` is an empty list, `j` is 1, and if `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list that contains 1.***
