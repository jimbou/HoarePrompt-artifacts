Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the first input, w is a list of integers equal to the second input, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be equal to the first input from stdin, and the value of `w` has been updated to be a list of integers equal to the second input from stdin. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 2, from `t-3` to `t-4`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the buffer remains empty.
