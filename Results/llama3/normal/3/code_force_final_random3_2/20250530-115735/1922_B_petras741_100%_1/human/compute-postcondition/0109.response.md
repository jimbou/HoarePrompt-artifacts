Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer greater than 0, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where each q[w[j]] is equal to the number of times w[j] appears in w, j is n+1, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is an empty list, eta is a list containing all the values j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of values in eta, rho is the number of times the first value in eta appears in w.**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the number of values in eta to eta_ln. Since eta contains all the values j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is equal to the number of values in eta. The second line assigns the number of times the first value in eta appears in w to rho. Since eta contains all the values j from 0 to n where q[j] is greater than 0, the first value in eta is the first value j where q[j] is greater than 0. Therefore, rho is equal to the number of times this value appears in w.
