Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The program first counts the frequency of each stick length, then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length, and finally calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of different lengths.

The program correctly handles the case where all sticks have the same length, as well as the case where there are multiple sticks of different lengths. The program also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of different lengths by considering all possible combinations of stick lengths.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
