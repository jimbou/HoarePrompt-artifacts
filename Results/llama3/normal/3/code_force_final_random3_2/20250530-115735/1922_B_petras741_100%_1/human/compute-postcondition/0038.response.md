Output: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range n, res is the number of combinations of 3 elements from the value at index eta[0] in w plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln), stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, j is eta_ln, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is more than 1, and rho is the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range(eta_ln), and the value of res is printed**
