Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w and the rest are 0, `res` is the number of combinations of 3 w[eta[0]] in w, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is n, `eta` is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the number of indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, `rho` is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w, and `eta_ln` is more than 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w and the rest are 0, res is the number of combinations of 3 w[eta[0]] in w plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, j is 1, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]], stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w and the rest are 0, res is the number of combinations of 3 w[eta[0]] in w plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, j is 2, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]], stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w and the rest are 0, res is the number of combinations of 3 w[eta[0]] in w plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, j is 3, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 3, rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]] plus q[eta[j]], stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
