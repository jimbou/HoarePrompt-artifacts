Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `w` is a list of integers equal to the second input, `q` is a list of `n+1` zeros, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, buffer is an empty list**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, and the buffer remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `q`, which is a list of `n+1` zeros. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases, indicating that the input has not been consumed or modified by the code.
