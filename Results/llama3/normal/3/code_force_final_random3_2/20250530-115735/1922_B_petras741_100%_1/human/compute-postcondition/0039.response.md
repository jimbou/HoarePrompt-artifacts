Postcondition: **t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range n, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, j is n if eta_ln is 1, otherwise j is eta_ln, eta is a list containing all the indices j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of indices j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, and rho is the number of times the value at index eta[0] appears in w if eta_ln is 1, otherwise rho is the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range(eta_ln). If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is being printed, which is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6. Otherwise, the value of res is printed, which is the number of combinations of 3 elements from the value at index eta[0] in w plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln).**
