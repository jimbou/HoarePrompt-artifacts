Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[2]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `q[w[j]]` has been incremented by 1, where `j` is 2. Since `w` is a list of integers, `w[2]` is an integer index into the list `q`. The value at this index in `q` has been incremented from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
