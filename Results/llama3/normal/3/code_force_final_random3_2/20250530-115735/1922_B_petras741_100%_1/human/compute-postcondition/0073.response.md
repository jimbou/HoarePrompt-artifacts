Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w and the rest are 0, res is the number of combinations of 3 w[eta[0]] in w plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho, j is 1, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is at least 2, rho is the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w plus q[eta[j]], stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list.**

The code block modifies the values of `res` and `rho`. The first line adds the number of combinations of 3 `w[eta[0]]` in `w` to `res`, which is calculated as `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`. The second line adds the number of combinations of 2 `w[eta[0]]` in `w` multiplied by the number of times `w[eta[0]]` appears in `w` to `res`, which is calculated as `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. The third line increments `rho` by the value of `q[eta[j]]`, which is the number of times `w[eta[j]]` appears in `w`. No other variables are affected.
