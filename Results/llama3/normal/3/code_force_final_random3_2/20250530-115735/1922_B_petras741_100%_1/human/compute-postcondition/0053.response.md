Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` and the rest are 0, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `q` will have the count of each integer in the list `w` at the corresponding index, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
