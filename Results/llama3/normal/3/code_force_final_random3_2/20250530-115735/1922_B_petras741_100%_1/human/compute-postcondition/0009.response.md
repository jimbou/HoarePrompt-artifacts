To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `j` is now 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[0]` is 2 and the value at index `w[1]` is 1 and the rest are 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is 2**
