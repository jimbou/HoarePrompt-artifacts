Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, q is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w and the rest are 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list, j is either n or eta_ln, eta is a list containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, eta_ln is the number of indices j where q[j] is greater than 0, rho is either the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w or the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range(eta_ln). If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from n elements which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 is being printed. Otherwise, the number of combinations of 3 w[eta[0]] in w plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln) is being printed.***
