Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index `w[j]` is the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w` for all `j` in range `n`, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is 1, and if the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the values 0 and 1. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `eta` has been updated based on the condition `if the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` now contains the values 0 and 1. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
