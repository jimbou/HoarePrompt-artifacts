Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is equal to the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w`, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list. `eta` is a list containing all the values `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `i`, `w`, `q`, stdin, and buffer as in the initial state. The variable `j` will be equal to `n+1`, and the list `eta` will contain all the values `j` from 0 to `n` where the count of `w[j]` in `w` is greater than 0.
