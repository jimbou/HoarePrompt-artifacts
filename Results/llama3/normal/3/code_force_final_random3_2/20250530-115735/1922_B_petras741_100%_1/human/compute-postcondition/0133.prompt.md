Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a non-negative integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n, then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. n and a_i are non-negative integers. 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, buffer is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, i is 0, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-2 test cases, buffer is an empty list. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w for all j in range n. Then, a list eta is created containing all the indices j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0, and eta_ln is the number of indices j in range n+1 where q[j] is greater than 0. If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed, which is equal to n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6. Otherwise, the value of res is printed, which is the number of combinations of 3 elements from the value at index eta[0] in w plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln). If n is less than 3, the number 0 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer, w is a list of integers, stdin contains t-4 test cases, buffer is an empty list. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a list q of n+1 integers is created where the value at index w[j] is the number of times w[j] appears in w and the rest are 0. Then, a list eta containing all the indices j where q[j] is greater than 0 is created, and eta_ln is the number of indices j where q[j] is greater than 0. rho is either the number of times w[eta[0]] appears in w or the sum of q[eta[j]] for all j in range(eta_ln). If eta_ln is 1, the number of combinations of 3 elements from n elements which is n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 is being printed. Otherwise, the number of combinations of 3 w[eta[0]] in w plus the sum of q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 plus q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho for all j in range(1, eta_ln) is being printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer from stdin, w is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is an empty list. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a complex calculation involving combinations and the number of times the first value in eta appears in w is performed for each value in eta, and the results are summed up, and if there is only one value in eta, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
