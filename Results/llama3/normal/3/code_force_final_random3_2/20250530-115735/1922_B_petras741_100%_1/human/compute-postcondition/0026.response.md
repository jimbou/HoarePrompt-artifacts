The code prints the result of the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, which is a mathematical formula for calculating the number of combinations of 3 items from a set of `n` items.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, the expression will evaluate to a specific integer value.

Output: **n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
