Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers, `q` is a list of `n+1` integers where each `q[w[j]]` is equal to the number of times `w[j]` appears in `w`, `eta` is an empty list, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, buffer is an empty list, `j` is `n`.**

In this output state, a new variable `eta` has been introduced and is assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-6` test cases, and the buffer is still empty. The variable `j` is still equal to `n`.
