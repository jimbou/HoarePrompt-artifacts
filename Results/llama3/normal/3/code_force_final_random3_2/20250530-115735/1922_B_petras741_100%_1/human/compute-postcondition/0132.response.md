Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, i is 2, n is an integer from stdin, w is a list of integers from stdin, stdin contains t-6 test cases, buffer is an empty list. If n is greater than or equal to 3, a complex calculation involving combinations and the number of times the first value in eta appears in w is performed for each value in eta, and the results are summed up, and if there is only one value in eta, the number of combinations of 3 elements from a set of n elements is printed. If n is less than 3, 0 is printed.***
