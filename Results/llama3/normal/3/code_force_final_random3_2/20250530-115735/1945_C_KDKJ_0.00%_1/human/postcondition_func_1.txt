The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of 0s and 1s. It then executes the `func_1()` function for each test case, without modifying the input or producing any output. The function's purpose is to process the test cases by executing `func_1()` for each one, without altering the state of the program or the input variables.
