Output State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases.**

The code snippet is empty, so it does not have any impact on the program. The values of the variables and the state of the stdin remain the same. The function `func_1()` has already been executed, and the variable `_` still holds the value 2. The stdin still contains multiple test cases.
