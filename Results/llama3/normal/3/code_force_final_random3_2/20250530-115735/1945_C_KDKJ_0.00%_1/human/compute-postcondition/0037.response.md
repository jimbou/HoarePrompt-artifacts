Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length n, S is a list containing n+1 lists, where the first list is [0, 0], and each subsequent list is updated based on the corresponding character in a, left is S[i][0], lsum is S[i][0] + S[i][1], right is S[-1][1] - S[i][1], rsum is n - lsum, if left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n/2 and i is less than or equal to the absolute difference between n/2 and ans, then ans is 1, otherwise ans remains 0, satisfy is 0, i is 1, stdin is empty.***
