Output: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length n, S is a list containing n+1 lists, where the first list is [0, 0], and each subsequent list is updated based on the corresponding character in a, left is S[i][0], lsum is S[i][0] + S[i][1], right is S[-1][1] - S[i][1], rsum is n - lsum, ans is the index i for which the absolute difference between n/2 and i is minimized, satisfy is 0, i is n, stdin is empty, and the index i for which the absolute difference between n/2 and i is minimized, which is ans, is being printed**
