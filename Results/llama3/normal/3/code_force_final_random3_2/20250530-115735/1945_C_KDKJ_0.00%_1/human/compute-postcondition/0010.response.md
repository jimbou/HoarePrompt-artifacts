Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list is `[0, 0]`, and the second list is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether the first character of `a` is '0' or not, `stdin` is empty, and `x` is either 1 or 0 and `y` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `S[-1]`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `S`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. However, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to be equal to the values in the last list of `S`. Specifically, if the last list of `S` is `[1, 0]`, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, and if the last list of `S` is `[0, 1]`, then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1.
