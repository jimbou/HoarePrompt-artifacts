The only objects in the loop head are variables  `_` and the function `input()` and the function `func_1()` is not in the loop head, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`.  If the `input()` has at least 2 test cases the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, and the function `func_1()` has been executed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `input()` must have at least 2 test cases and the `_` is 1.
State: **`_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
