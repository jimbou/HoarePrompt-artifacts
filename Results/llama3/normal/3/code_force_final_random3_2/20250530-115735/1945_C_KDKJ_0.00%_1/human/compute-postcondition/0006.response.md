Output State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `_` is equal to the number of test cases, and stdin contains multiple test cases.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the function `func_1()` will have been executed a number of times equal to the number of test cases provided in the input. The variable `_` will hold the value of the number of test cases, and the input stream `stdin` will still contain multiple test cases.
