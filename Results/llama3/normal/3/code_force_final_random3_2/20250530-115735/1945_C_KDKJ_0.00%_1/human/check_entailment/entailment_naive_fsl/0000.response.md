Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input string `a` of length `n` and calculates the cumulative sum of zeros and ones in the string. It then iterates over the string, checking for each position `i` whether the number of zeros on the left side and the number of ones on the right side are both at least half of the total number of houses on their respective sides. If this condition is met, it updates the answer `ans` to be the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the input string has an odd length, the program correctly calculates the cumulative sum and checks the condition for each position.
* When the input string has an even length, the program correctly calculates the cumulative sum and checks the condition for each position.
* When the input string has only zeros or only ones, the program correctly calculates the cumulative sum and checks the condition for each position.
* When the input string has a mix of zeros and ones, the program correctly calculates the cumulative sum and checks the condition for each position.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input string has a length of 3, 6, or 3*10^5.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
