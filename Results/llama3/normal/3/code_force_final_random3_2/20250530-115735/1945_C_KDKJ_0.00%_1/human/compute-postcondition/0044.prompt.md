Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length n, S is a list containing n+1 lists, where the first list is [0, 0], and each subsequent list is updated based on the corresponding character in a, stdin is empty, ans is 0, satisfy is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n`, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, where the first list is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent list is updated based on the corresponding character in `a`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin is empty. If `left` times 2 is less than `lsum` or `right` times 2 is less than `rsum`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `left` is greater than or equal to half of `lsum` or `right` is greater than or equal to half of `rsum`, and the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n/2` and `ans`, then `ans` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length n, S is a list containing n+1 lists, where the first list is [0, 0], and each subsequent list is updated based on the corresponding character in a, left is S[i][0], lsum is S[i][0] + S[i][1], right is S[-1][1] - S[i][1], rsum is n - lsum, if left * 2 is less than lsum or right * 2 is less than rsum, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n/2 and i is less than or equal to the absolute difference between n/2 and ans, then ans is 1, otherwise ans remains 0, satisfy is 0, i is 1, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive integer greater than 0, a is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length n, S is a list containing n+1 lists, where the first list is [0, 0], and each subsequent list is updated based on the corresponding character in a, left is S[i][0], lsum is S[i][0] + S[i][1], right is S[-1][1] - S[i][1], rsum is n - lsum, i is 2, if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n/2 and i is less than or equal to the absolute difference between n/2 and ans, then ans is 2, otherwise ans remains 0, satisfy is 0, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
