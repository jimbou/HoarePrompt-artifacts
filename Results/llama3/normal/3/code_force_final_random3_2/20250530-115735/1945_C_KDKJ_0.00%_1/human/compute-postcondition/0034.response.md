Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n`, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, where the first list is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent list is updated based on the corresponding character in `a`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - lsum`, `ans` is 0, `satisfy` is 0, `i` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. No variables have changed values, and the stdin remains empty.
