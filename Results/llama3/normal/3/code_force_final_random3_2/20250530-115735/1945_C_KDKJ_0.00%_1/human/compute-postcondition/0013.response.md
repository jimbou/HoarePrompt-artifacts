Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list is `[0, 0]`, and the second list is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether the first character of `a` is '0' or not, `stdin` is empty. If `s` is '0', then `x` is either 2 or 1 and `y` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `S[-1]`. If `s` is not '0', then `x` is either 1 or 0 and `y` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `S[-1]`.***
