Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, a is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length n, S is a list containing a single list [0, 0], stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for s in a:
    x, y = S[-1]
    if s == '0':
        x += 1
    else:
        y += 1
    S.append([x, y])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n` that must have at least 1 character, `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list is `[0, 0]`, and the second list is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether the first character of `a` is '0' or not, `stdin` is empty, and if the first character `s` of `a` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, otherwise `x` is 0 and `y` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing three lists: the first list is `[0, 0]`, the second list is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether the first character of `a` is '0' or not, and the third list is either `[2, 0]`, `[1, 1]`, `[1, 2]`, or `[0, 1]` depending on the value of `S[-1]` and the first character of `a`, `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing four lists, where the first three lists have configurations updated based on the second character of `a` and the previous state of `S`, and the last list is a new list containing two elements `x` and `y`, `stdin` is empty. If the second character of `a` is '0', then the first element of the third list in `S` is increased by 1. If the second character of `a` is '1', then the second element of the third list in `S` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
