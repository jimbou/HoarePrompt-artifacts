Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing three lists: the first list is `[0, 0]`, the second list is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether the first character of `a` is '0' or not, and the third list is either `[2, 0]`, `[1, 1]`, `[1, 2]`, or `[0, 1]` depending on the value of `S[-1]` and the first character of `a`, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the list `S` has been updated by appending a new list containing the values of `x` and `y`, which depend on the value of `S[-1]` and the first character of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
