Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing four lists, where the first three lists have configurations updated based on the second character of `a` and the previous state of `S`, and the last list is a new list containing two elements `x` and `y`, `stdin` is empty. If the second character of `a` is '0', then the first element of the third list in `S` is increased by 1. If the second character of `a` is '1', then the second element of the third list in `S` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `a` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `S` now contains four lists, where the first three lists have the same configurations as in the initial state, and the last list is a new list containing two elements `x` and `y`. The configurations of the first three lists in `S` are still updated based on the second character of `a` and the previous state of `S`. The `stdin` remains empty.
