Output State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases.**

The code snippet simply calls the function `func_1()`, which has already been executed according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the function `func_1()` still having been executed, `_` still being 1, and stdin still containing multiple test cases.
