Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a string of '0' and '1' characters of length `n` that must have at least 2 characters, `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list is `[0, 0]`, and the second list is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` depending on whether the first character of `a` is '0' or not, `x` is either 1 or 0 and `y` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `S[-1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The string `a` still consists of '0' and '1' characters with a length of `n` and has at least 2 characters. The list `S` remains the same, containing two lists where the first list is `[0, 0]` and the second list depends on the first character of `a`. The value of `x` is either 1 or 0, and the value of `y` is either 1 or 2, depending on the value of the last element in list `S`.
