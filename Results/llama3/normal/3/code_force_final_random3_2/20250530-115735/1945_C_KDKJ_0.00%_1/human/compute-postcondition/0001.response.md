Output State: **`_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, as the code snippet does not consume or modify the input. The function `func_1()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are not specified, so we cannot determine any changes to the state beyond the execution of the function.
