Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of size t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of count is 2, which is also the number of '1's in a. Additionally, count is not equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2. The second '1' in a is immediately followed by another '1'.***
