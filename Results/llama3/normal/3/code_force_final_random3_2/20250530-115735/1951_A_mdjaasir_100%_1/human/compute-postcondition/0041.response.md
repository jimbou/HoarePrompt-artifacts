The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `a` is a binary string of size `t`, `count` is an integer equal to the number of '1' in `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
