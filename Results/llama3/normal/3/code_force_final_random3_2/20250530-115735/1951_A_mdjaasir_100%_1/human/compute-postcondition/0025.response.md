The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string of size `t`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
