Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of size `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which is obtained from the first input in the test case. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only has one input left, which is a binary string of size `t`.
