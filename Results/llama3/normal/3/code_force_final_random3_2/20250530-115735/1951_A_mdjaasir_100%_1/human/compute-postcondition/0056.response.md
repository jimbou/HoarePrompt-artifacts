Postcondition: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a binary string of size t, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count > 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the second '1' in a is not followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
