Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a binary string of size t, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count > 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the character after the first '1' in a is not '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
