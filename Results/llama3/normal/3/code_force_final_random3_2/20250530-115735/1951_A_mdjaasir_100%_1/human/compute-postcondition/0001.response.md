The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of size `t`.**
