Output State: **t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a binary string of size t, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 2. The value of `i` also remains unchanged at 2. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to the input value from stdin. The value of `a` is updated to be a binary string of size `t`. The value of `count` is updated to be equal to the number of '1' in the binary string `a`. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, as two inputs have been read.
