Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of size t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the count of '1's in a is 0, 'YES' is printed. If the count of '1's in a is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If the count of '1's in a is 2, then if the second '1' in a is not immediately followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
