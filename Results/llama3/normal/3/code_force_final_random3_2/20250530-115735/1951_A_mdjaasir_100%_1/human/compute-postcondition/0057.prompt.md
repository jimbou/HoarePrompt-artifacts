Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of size `t`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of size t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the count of '1's in a is 0, 'YES' is printed. If the count of '1's in a is greater than 2 and is an even number, 'YES' is printed. If the count of '1's in a is 2, then if the second '1' in a is not immediately followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 1, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a binary string of size t, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count > 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the character after the first '1' in a is not '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a binary string of size t, count is an integer equal to the number of '1' in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If count is 0, 'YES' is printed. If count > 2 and count is even, 'YES' is printed. If count is 2 and the second '1' in a is not followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
