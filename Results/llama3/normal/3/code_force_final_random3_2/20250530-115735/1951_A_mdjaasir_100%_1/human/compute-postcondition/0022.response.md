Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000, i is 0, n is an integer, a is a binary string of size t, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and count is not equal to 0. If count is 2, then if the second '1' in a is not immediately followed by another '1', 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the second '1' in a is immediately followed by another '1', then 'NO' is printed. If count is not 2, then 'NO' is printed.***
