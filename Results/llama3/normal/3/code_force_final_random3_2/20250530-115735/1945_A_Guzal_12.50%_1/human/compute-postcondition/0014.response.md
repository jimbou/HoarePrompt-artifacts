The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If b is not divisible by 3 and c is less than 3 and their sum is not divisible by 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, then k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c plus 1 and the value of k is printed. If the sum of b and c is divisible by 3, then k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c and the value of k is printed.**
