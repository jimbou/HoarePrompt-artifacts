Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the number of introverts and the sum of extroverts and universals, taking into account whether the sum of extroverts and universals is a multiple of 3. If the sum of extroverts and universals is not a multiple of 3 and there are less than 3 universals, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated value. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.**
