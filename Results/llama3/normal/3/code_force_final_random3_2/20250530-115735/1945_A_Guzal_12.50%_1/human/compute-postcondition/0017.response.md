Output: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, a is an integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, k is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If b is not divisible by 3 and c is less than 3 and their sum is not divisible by 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, then k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c plus 1 and the value of k is printed. If the sum of b and c is divisible by 3, then k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c and the value of k is printed, and -1 is printed**
