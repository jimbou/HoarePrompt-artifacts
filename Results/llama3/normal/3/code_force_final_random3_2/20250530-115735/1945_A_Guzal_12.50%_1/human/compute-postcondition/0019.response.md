The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus `a`. Therefore, the new value of `k` is one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus `a` plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus `a` plus 1.**
