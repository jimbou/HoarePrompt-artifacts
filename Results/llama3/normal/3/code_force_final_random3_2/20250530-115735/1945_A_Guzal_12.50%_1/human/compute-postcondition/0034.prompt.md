Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three non-negative integers a, b, and c, where a is the number of introverts, b is the number of extroverts, and c is the number of universals.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    k = 0
    if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        k += a + (b + c) // 3
        if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            k += 1
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, i is 0, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If b is not divisible by 3 and c is less than 3 and their sum is not divisible by 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, then k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c plus 1 and the value of k is printed. If the sum of b and c is divisible by 3, then k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c and the value of k is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, i is 1, a is an integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer. If b is not divisible by 3 and c is less than 3 and their sum is not divisible by 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, then k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c plus 1 and the value of k is printed. If the sum of b and c is divisible by 3, then k is a plus one-third of the sum of b and c and the value of k is printed. If the condition in the if statement is not met, then k is one-third of the sum of b and c plus a plus 1, and k is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, a, b, and c are integers, k is either 0 and -1 is printed if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0. Otherwise, k is equal to its initial value plus a plus one-third of the sum of b and c. If the sum of b and c is not a multiple of 3, k is increased by 1, and the value of k is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
