Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `a` plus one-third of the sum of `b` and `c`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Either (`b` % 3 == 0 or `c` is greater than or equal to 3) or (`b` + `c`) % 3 == 0. The current value of (`b` + `c`) % 3 is not equal to 0.**
