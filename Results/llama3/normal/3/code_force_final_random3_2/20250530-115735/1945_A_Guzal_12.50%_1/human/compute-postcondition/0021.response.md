To determine what will be printed when the `print(k)` statement is executed, let's analyze the given initial state and the formula for calculating `k`.

Given:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is a non-negative integer.
- `c` is a non-negative integer.

The formula for `k` is based on whether the sum of `b` and `c` is divisible by 3 or not. However, the initial state describes two scenarios for calculating `k`, but both scenarios lead to the same formula for `k`: one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus `a` plus 1.

Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute an exact numerical value for `k`. However, we can describe `k` based on the given formula.

Therefore, when the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `k`, which is one-third of the sum of `b` and `c` plus `a` plus 1.

Output: **one-third of the sum of b and c plus a plus 1**
