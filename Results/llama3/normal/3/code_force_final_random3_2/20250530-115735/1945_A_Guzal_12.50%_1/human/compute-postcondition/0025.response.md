Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, a, b, and c are integers, k is 0**.

The first line of the code assigns the values of three space-separated integers from the input to the variables a, b, and c, respectively. Since the initial state specifies that a is an integer, and b and c are non-negative integers, the new values of a, b, and c will be integers. The second line initializes a new variable k and assigns it the value 0. The value of n remains greater than 2, and the value of i remains 2, as they are not modified by the code.
