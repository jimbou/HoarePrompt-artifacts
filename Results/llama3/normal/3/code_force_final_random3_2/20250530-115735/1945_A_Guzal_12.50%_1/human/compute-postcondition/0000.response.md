Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three non-negative integers a, b, and c, where a is the number of introverts, b is the number of extroverts, and c is the number of universals.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the first non-negative integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers a, b, and c, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
