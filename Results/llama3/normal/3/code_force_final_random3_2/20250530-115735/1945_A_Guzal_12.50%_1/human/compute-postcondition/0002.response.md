Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, c is a non-negative integer, k is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The code reads a test case from stdin and assigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to the corresponding variables. Since each test case contains three non-negative integers, `a`, `b`, and `c` become non-negative integers. The variable `k` is initialized to 0. Stdin now contains one less test case because one test case has been read.
