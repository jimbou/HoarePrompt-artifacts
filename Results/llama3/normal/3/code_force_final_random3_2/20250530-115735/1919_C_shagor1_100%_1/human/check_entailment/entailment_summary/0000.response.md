Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences. The program uses two variables, `la` and `lb`, to keep track of the last elements in the two subsequences. It iterates over the input array, and for each element, it checks if it can be appended to the first subsequence (`la`) or the second subsequence (`lb`). If it cannot be appended to either, it increments the penalty count (`ans`) and updates `la` and `lb` accordingly. The program then prints the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. For example, when the input array has only one element, the program correctly outputs 0 as the minimum possible penalty. Similarly, when the input array is already sorted, the program correctly outputs 0 as the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
