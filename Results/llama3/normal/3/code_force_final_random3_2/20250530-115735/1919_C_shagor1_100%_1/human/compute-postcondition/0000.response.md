Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). No changes have been made to the input or variables.**

The code `pass` does not perform any operations, so the input and variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. No new variables have been introduced, and no existing variables have been modified.
