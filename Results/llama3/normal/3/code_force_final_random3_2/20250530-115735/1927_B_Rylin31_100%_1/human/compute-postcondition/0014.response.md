Output State: **i is 1, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 1, array is a list of l integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a string containing a single character which is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s, stdin is empty, j is the first element in the array**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The number of test cases `l` also remains the same, being at least 1. The list `s` now contains `l` integers, with the `jth` element being 1, as it was incremented by 1. The list `array` remains unchanged, containing `l` integers with at least one element. The string `ans` now contains a single character, which is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 plus the original value of the `jth` element in `s`. The standard input `stdin` remains empty. Finally, the value of `j` remains the same, being the first element in the `array`.
