To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in array:`. The objects involved are `j` and `array`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the second element in the `array`. For the loop to execute again, `array` must have at least three elements.

So, we need to adjust the state of `array` to have at least three elements, and `j` should be the third element in the `array`.

The other variables `i`, `l`, `s`, `ans`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a number of test cases `t` that is at least 1, `s` is a list of `l` integers where the jth element is 2, `array` is a list of `l` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is a string containing two characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s` and 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `j` is the third element in the `array`**
