The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and array, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array.  If the array has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is 0, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l zeros, ans is an empty string, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the array must have at least 1 element and the j is the first element in the array.
State: **`i` is 0, `l` is a number of test cases `t` that is at least 1, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` is empty, `j` is the first element in the array**
