Output State: **i is t-1, l is an integer, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is the number of times j appears in the array and the rest are 0, array is a list of integers, ans is a string of length equal to the length of the array containing the characters 'a' to 'z' repeated as necessary, j is the last integer in the array, and the string ans is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop counter `i` has reached the last test case `t-1`, the length of the current test case `l` is an integer, the list `s` contains the frequency of each index in the array, the array is the last test case, the answer string `ans` is a sequence of lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s`, 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s` plus 1, and so on, up to the last iteration, and the last integer in the array is being processed.
