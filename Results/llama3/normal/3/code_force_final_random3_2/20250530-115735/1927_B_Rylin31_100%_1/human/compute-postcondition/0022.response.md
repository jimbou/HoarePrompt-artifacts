To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`, which is evaluated to `l` (the number of test cases).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `l` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `l`. Since `i` is 1, we need to increment it to 2. The value of `l` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is still at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`i` is 2, `l` is at least 2, `s` is a list of `l` integers, `array` is an empty list, `ans` is a string containing a sequence of lowercase letters, `stdin` is empty, `j` is undefined**

Note that we didn't change the state of `s`, `array`, `ans`, `stdin`, or `j` because they are not part of the loop head.
