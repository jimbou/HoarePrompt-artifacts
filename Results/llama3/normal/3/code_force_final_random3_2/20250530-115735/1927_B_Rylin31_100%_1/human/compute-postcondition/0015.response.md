The only object in the loop head is variable  j and list array, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array.  If the array has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, array has at least 1 element, j is the first element in the array. So for the loop to be executed one more time the array must have at least 2 elements and the j is the second element in the array.
State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a number of test cases `t` that is at least 1, `s` is a list of `l` integers where the jth element is 1, `array` is a list of `l` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a string containing a single character which is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s`, `stdin` is empty, `j` is the second element in the `array`**
