Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= a_i < n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is the number of times the jth index was accessed in the array, array is an empty list, ans is a string consisting of characters with ASCII values starting from 98 and incrementing by 1 for each character, stdin is empty, j is undefined, and the string ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is equal to the number of times the loop iterates, array is an empty list, ans is a string containing a sequence of lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s, 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s plus 1, and so on, up to the last iteration, stdin is empty, j is undefined, and the string ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 2, l is an integer, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is the number of times j appears in the array and the rest are 0, array is a list of integers, ans is a string of length equal to the length of the array containing the characters 'a' to 'z' repeated as necessary, j is the last integer in the array, and the string ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
