Output State: **i is 0, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 2, array is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a string consisting of two characters with ASCII values 98 and 99, stdin is empty, j is the second element in the array**

Explanation: The first line appends the character with ASCII value `s[j] + 97` to the string `ans`. Since `s[j]` is 1, the character with ASCII value 98 (which is 'b') is appended to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 'bb'. The second line increments the `jth` element of `s` by 1, making it equal to 2. No other variables are affected.
