The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` which contains a sequence of lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s`, 97 plus the original value of the jth element in `s` plus 1, and so on, up to the last iteration.

Since `s` is a list of `l` integers where the jth element is equal to the number of times the loop iterates, and `ans` is a string containing a sequence of lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values calculated based on the elements of `s`, the exact output will depend on the values in `s`.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string of lowercase letters where each letter is determined by the corresponding element in `s`.

Output: **a string of lowercase letters where each letter is determined by the corresponding element in s**
