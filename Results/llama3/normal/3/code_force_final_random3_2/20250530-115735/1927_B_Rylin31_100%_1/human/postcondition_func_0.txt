The function reads a number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then generates a string of length n by mapping each integer to a character 'a' to 'z' (repeating as necessary) based on the number of times the integer appears in the array. The function prints the generated string for each test case.
