Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 1, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l zeros, array is a list of l integers, ans is an empty string, stdin is empty, j is undefined
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 1, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 1, array is a list of l integers that must have at least 1 element, ans is a string containing a single character which is the lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s, stdin is empty, j is the first element in the array

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 2, array is a list of l integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a string containing two characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s and 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s plus 1, stdin is empty, j is the second element in the array

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 1, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 3, array is a list of l integers that must have at least 3 elements, ans is a string containing three characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s, 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s plus 1, and 97 plus the new value of the jth element in s, stdin is empty, j is the third element in the array




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
