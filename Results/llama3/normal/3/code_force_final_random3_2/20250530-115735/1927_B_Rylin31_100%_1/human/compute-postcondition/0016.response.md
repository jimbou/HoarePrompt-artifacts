Output State: **i is 1, l is a number of test cases t that is at least 1, s is a list of l integers where the jth element is 2, array is a list of l integers that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a string containing two characters which are the lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s and 97 plus the original value of the jth element in s plus 1, stdin is empty, j is the second element in the array**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `l` also remains the same, representing the number of test cases `t`, which is at least 1. The list `s` still contains `l` integers, but the `jth` element has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `array` remains unchanged, with at least 2 elements. The string `ans` now contains two characters, both of which are lowercase letters corresponding to the ASCII values 97 plus the original value of the `jth` element in `s` and 97 plus the original value of the `jth` element in `s` plus 1. The stdin remains empty, and the value of `j` is still the second element in the `array`.
