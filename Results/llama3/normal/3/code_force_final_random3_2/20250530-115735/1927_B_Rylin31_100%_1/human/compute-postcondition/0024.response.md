The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and array, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array.  If the array has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, l is an integer, s is a list of l zeros, ans is an empty string, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the array must have at least 1 integer and the j is the first integer in the array.
State: **`i` is 2, `l` is an integer, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `array` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is an empty string, `stdin` is empty, `j` is the first integer in the array**
