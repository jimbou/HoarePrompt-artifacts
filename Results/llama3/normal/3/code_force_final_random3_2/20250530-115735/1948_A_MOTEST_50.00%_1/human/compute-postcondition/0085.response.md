Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is `t`, stdin is empty. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, `x` is `n//2`, `j` is `n//2 - 1`, and `ans` is a string consisting of two occurrences of each uppercase English letter from 'A' to the (`n//2`)th uppercase English letter. If `n` is odd, 'YES' is printed, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `ans` is 'AAA' followed by 2 * (`n // 2 - 1`) uppercase English letters, and `ans` is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the string `s` remains unchanged as the string of all uppercase English letters, and the integer `t` remains unchanged as an integer at least 1. The loop counter `i` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The standard input `stdin` is empty, as all the integers have been read and processed. The output depends on the value of `n`, which is the last integer read from `stdin`. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, and the string `ans` consists of two occurrences of each uppercase English letter from 'A' to the (`n//2`)th uppercase English letter. If `n` is odd, 'YES' is printed, and the string `ans` is 'AAA' followed by 2 * (`n // 2 - 1`) uppercase English letters.
