Postcondition: ***`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is the second integer in stdin, stdin contains `t-5` integers. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is at least 3, 'YES' is printed, and a string `ans` is printed. If `n` is even, `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 3, and `j` is `n // 2`. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAABCCDDDD...ZZ', `x` is `n // 2 - 1 + 1`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.***
