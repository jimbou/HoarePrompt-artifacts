The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. Since `stdin` contains `t` integers and `t` is at least 1, the first integer is assigned to `n`. The value of `n` is now an integer. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since one integer is accepted from the input, `stdin` now contains `t-1` integers. The value of `i` is still 0. The string `s` is still the string of all uppercase English letters.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` integers**
