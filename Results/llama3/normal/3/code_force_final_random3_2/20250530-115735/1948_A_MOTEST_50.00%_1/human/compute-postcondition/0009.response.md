To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. Since the loop condition is `range(n // 2)`, we need to ensure that `n // 2` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an even integer and is at least 4, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `x` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` integers, `j` is 0**
