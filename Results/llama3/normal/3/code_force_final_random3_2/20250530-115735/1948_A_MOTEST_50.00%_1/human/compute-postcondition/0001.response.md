According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`stdin` contains t integers, `n` is an integer, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 0**
