The first line appends the character at index `x` in string `s` twice to `ans`. Since `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `x` is 0, and the first character in `s` is 'A', `ans` becomes 'AA'. The second line increments `x` by 1, making `x` equal to 1.

Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer and is at least 7, i is 2, n is the second integer in stdin and is at least 2, stdin contains t-5 integers, ans is 'AA', x is 1, j is 0**
