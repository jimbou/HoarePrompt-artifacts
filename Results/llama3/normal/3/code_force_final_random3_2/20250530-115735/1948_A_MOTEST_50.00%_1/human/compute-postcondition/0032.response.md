Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer in stdin, stdin contains `t-3` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be equal to the first integer in the stdin, which was not specified in the initial state. The values of `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-3` integers, as one integer has been consumed by the `input()` function.
