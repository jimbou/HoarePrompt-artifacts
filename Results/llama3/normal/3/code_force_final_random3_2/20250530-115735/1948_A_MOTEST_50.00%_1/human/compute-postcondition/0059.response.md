The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `n` was previously equal to the first integer in stdin, and stdin contains `t-4` integers, the new value of `n` is the second integer in stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is the second integer in stdin, stdin contains `t-5` integers.**
