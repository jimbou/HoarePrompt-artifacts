Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer and is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer and is equal to the first integer in stdin, ans is a string consisting of two occurrences of each uppercase English letter from 'A' to the (n//2)th uppercase English letter, x is n//2, stdin contains t-3 integers, j is n//2 - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The string `s` remains unchanged, containing all uppercase English letters.
* The integer `t` remains unchanged, being at least 2.
* The integer `i` remains unchanged, being 1.
* The integer `n` remains unchanged, being equal to the first integer in `stdin`.
* The string `ans` now consists of two occurrences of each uppercase English letter from 'A' to the (n//2)th uppercase English letter. For example, if `n` is 10, `ans` would be "AA" followed by two occurrences of 'B', then two occurrences of 'C', and so on up to two occurrences of 'J'.
* The integer `x` is now `n//2`, which is the number of iterations the loop executed.
* The contents of `stdin` remain unchanged, containing `t-3` integers.
* The loop variable `j` is now `n//2 - 1`, which is the last index of the loop.
