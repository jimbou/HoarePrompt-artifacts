Based on the precondition, we can determine the value of `ans` as follows:

* If `n` is even, then `t` is at least 7, and `ans` is `'AABBCC'`.
* If `n` is odd, then `ans` is `'AAABCCDDDD...ZZ'`.

Since `n` is at least 3, and `t` is at least 3, we can conclude that `n` is either even or odd.

However, the precondition also states that `'YES'` is being printed, which implies that `n` is odd. This is because if `n` were even, the precondition would not mention `'YES'` being printed.

Therefore, we can conclude that `n` is odd, and `ans` is `'AAABCCDDDD...ZZ'`.

Output: **AAABCCDDDD...ZZ**
