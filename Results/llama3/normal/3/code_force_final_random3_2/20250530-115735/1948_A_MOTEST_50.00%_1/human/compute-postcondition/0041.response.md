The first line appends to `ans` two occurrences of the character at index `x` in string `s`. Since `x` is 2, this character is the third uppercase English letter, which is 'C'. So `ans` becomes "AA" followed by two occurrences of the second uppercase English letter, and then two occurrences of 'C'. The second line increments `x` by 1, making `x` equal to 3. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer and is at least 2, i is 1, n is an integer and is at least 4, ans is "AA" followed by two occurrences of the second uppercase English letter, and then two occurrences of 'C', x is 3, stdin contains t-3 integers, j is 2**
