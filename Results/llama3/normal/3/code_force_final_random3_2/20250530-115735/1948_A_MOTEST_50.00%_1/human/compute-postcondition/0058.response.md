The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer in stdin, stdin contains `t-4` integers.**
