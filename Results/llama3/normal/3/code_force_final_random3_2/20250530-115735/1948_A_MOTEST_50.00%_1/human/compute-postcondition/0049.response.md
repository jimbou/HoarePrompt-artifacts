The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and n. If j is less than n // 2 - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, n is an odd integer and is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 and n must be at least 7.
