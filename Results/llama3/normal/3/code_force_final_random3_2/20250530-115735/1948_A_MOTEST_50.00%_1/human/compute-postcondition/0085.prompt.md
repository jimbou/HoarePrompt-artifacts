Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t integers n, s is the string of all uppercase English letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` integers. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even and is at least 2, 'YES' is printed, ans is the string of all uppercase English letters with each letter repeated twice and x is n // 2. If `n` is odd and is at least 3, 'YES' is printed, ans is 'AAABBB...ZZZ' (where '...' represents the repetition of the pattern of uppercase English letters) and x is n // 2, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and is equal to the first integer in stdin, stdin contains `t-3` integers. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is printed, `x` is `n//2`, `j` is `n//2 - 1`, and `ans` is a string consisting of two occurrences of each uppercase English letter from 'A' to the (`n//2`)th uppercase English letter. If `n` is odd, 'YES' is printed, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `ans` is 'AAA' followed by 2 * (`n // 2 - 1`) uppercase English letters, and `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is the string of all uppercase English letters, `t` is an integer and is at least 3, `i` is 2, `n` is the second integer in stdin, stdin contains `t-5` integers. If `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is at least 3, 'YES' is printed, and a string `ans` is printed. If `n` is even, `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 3, and `j` is `n // 2`. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAABCCDDDD...ZZ', `x` is `n // 2 - 1 + 1`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
