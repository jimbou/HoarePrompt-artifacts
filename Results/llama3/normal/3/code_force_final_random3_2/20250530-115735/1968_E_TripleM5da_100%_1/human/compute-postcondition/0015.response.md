Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin contains one input: an integer between 1 and 50, and then t-1 lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, and then `n - 1` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one more than the value of `n`, which remains unchanged. The state of the input (stdin) also remains the same. The output will include the initial print statements "1, 2", followed by `n - 1` pairs of identical integers starting from 3 up to `n`.
