The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t), and each subsequent integer represents the number of pairs to be printed (n). For each test case, the function prints a specific pattern of pairs: (1, 1), (1, 2), and then n-1 pairs of identical integers from 3 to n. This pattern is repeated t times, and the function consumes all input from standard input.
