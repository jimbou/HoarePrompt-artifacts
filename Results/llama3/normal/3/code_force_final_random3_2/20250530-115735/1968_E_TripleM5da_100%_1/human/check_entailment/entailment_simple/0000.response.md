Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The coordinates are printed in the format "x y", where x and y are the row and column numbers of the cell, respectively.

The program uses a simple strategy to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. It first prints the coordinates of the cell at position (1, 1), and then it prints the coordinates of the cell at position (1, 2). After that, it prints the coordinates of the cells at positions (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n.

This strategy works because it ensures that the Manhattan distance between any pair of cells is unique. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. By printing the coordinates of the cells at positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n, the program ensures that the Manhattan distance between any pair of cells is either 0, 1, or a value greater than 1.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in the grid.

Correctness: **True**
