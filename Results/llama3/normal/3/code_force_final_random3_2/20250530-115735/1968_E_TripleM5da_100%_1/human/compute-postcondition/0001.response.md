Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin contains one input: an integer between 1 and 50, and then t-1 lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 10^3, which is the first input from stdin. The stdin now contains one input: an integer between 1 and 50, which is the number of test cases, and then t-1 lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), which are the remaining test cases.
