To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is an integer greater than 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is 4, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 5. Similarly, `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `m`, `stdin`, and the printed output are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-2` lines each containing an integer (2 <= m <= 10^3), and the printed output remains the same, and this is printed: 5, 5**
