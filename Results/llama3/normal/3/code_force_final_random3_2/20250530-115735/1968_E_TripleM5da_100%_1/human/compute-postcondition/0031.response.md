Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, and then `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and 1 and 2 are printed, and all pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n` are printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1`, and the value of `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 50. The input state of `stdin` will remain unchanged, containing `t-2` lines each with an integer between 2 and 10^3. The output will include the initial prints of 1, 2, and then all pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n` will be printed.
