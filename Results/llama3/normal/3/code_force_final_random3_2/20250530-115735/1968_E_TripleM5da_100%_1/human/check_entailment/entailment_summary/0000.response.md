Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes the number of test cases (t) and the size of the grid (n) as input and prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It first prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2), which are the base cases for the pattern. Then, it prints n-2 pairs of identical integers from 3 to n, which are the remaining cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The execution summary shows that the program correctly reads the input, prints the required output, and consumes all input from standard input. The output matches the expected output for the given problem.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program prints the same pattern for all test cases, regardless of the value of n. This means that the program does not correctly handle cases where n is greater than 2. For example, when n is 3, the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), which is not the correct solution.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
