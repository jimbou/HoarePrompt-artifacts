Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-2` lines each containing an integer (2 <= m <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, and then `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and 1 and 2 are printed, and all pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n` are printed, and 1 and 1 are printed, and 1 and 2 are printed, and all pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n` are printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` has reached `n + 1`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the input from stdin is still present. The output includes the initial numbers 1 and 2, followed by `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`, and then the final pair of identical integers.
