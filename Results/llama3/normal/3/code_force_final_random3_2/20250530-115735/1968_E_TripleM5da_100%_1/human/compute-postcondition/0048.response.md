Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, stdin is empty, and this is printed: 1, 2, and then `n - 1` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and 1 and 2 are printed, and all pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n` are printed, and this is repeated `t` times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the value `n + 1`, the input variable `n` has taken on all values between 2 and 10^3, the standard input `stdin` is empty, and the output consists of `t` repetitions of the pattern: 1, 2, and then `n - 1` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`.
