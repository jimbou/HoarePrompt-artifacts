To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `stdin` contains `t-2` lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3).

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `i` and the input from `stdin`. Since `i` is already `n + 1`, we can't adjust it further. However, we can adjust the input from `stdin`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to have at least one more line in `stdin` containing an integer. Let's assume the next integer in `stdin` is `m`, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 50.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-1` lines each containing an integer (2 <= m <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, and then `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and 1 and 2 are printed, and all pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n` are printed.**
