The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 5.
State: **`i` is 5, `n` is an integer that is at least 5, stdin contains one input: an integer between 1 and 50, and then t-1 lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 4, 4**
