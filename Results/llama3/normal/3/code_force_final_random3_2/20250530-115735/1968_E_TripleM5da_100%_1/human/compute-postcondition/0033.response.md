Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-2` lines each containing an integer (2 <= m <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, and then `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and 1 and 2 are printed, and all pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n` are printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be an integer between 2 and 50, since it was assigned the value of the input integer, which is between 2 and 10^3. The value of `i` is still `n + 1`, since it was not directly affected by the code. The value of `m` remains an integer between 1 and 50, as it was not changed by the code. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines each containing an integer, since one line was read and assigned to `n`. The printed output remains the same, with 1, 2, and then `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and 1 and 2 are printed, and all pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n` are printed.
