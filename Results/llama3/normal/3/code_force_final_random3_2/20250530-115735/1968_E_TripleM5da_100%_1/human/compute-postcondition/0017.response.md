Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, and then `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 1 and 50, which is the input from stdin. The value of `i` is still `n + 2`, but now `n` has a new value. The stdin now contains t-2 lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), and the printed output remains the same: 1, 2, and then `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`.
