To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer between 3 and 50.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `m` and the contents of `stdin` are not relevant to the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `m` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t-2` lines each containing an integer (2 <= m <= 10^3), and the printed output remains the same**
