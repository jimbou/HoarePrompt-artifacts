The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 4 and 50. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `n` must still be greater than `i`, so `n` is an integer greater than 4.
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer greater than 4, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing an integer (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, and then `n - 2` pairs of identical integers from 3 to `n`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and 1 and 2 are printed, and 3 and 3 are printed**
