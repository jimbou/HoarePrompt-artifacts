Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is n and the rest are 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is a list of integers that must have at least n integers, i is the last integer in the list, r is a string containing the character at index x in a repeated n times, t is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the first two inputs**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the string 'a' remains unchanged, the list 'b' has the integer 'n' at index 'x' and zeros elsewhere, the integer 'n' is within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, the list 's' has at least 'n' integers, the integer 'i' is the last integer in the list 's', the string 'r' contains the character at index 'x' in string 'a' repeated 'n' times, the integer 't' is 2, and the stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the first two inputs.
