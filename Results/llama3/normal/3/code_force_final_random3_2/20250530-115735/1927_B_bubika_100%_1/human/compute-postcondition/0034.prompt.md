Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times the integer x appears in the list s, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, r is a string containing the characters at the indices of the integers in the list s in the order they appear, t is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and the string r containing the characters at the indices of the integers in the list s in the order they appear is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is equal to the number of times the integer x appears in the list s and all other integers are 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is a list of integers that must have at least n integers, i is the last integer in the list, r is a string containing the character at index x in string a repeated the number of times the integer x appears in the list s, t is 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, and this is printed: a string containing the character at index x in string a repeated the number of times the integer x appears in the list s

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is n and the rest are 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is a list of integers that must have at least n integers, i is the last integer in the list, r is a string containing the character at index x in a repeated n times, t is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the first two inputs, and the string r is printed which is the character at index x in a repeated n times




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
