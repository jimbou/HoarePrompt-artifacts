Output State: **`a` is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer n and a space-separated list of n integers. The values of n and the list of integers in each test case remain unchanged.
