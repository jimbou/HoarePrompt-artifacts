Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is equal to the number of times the integer x appears in the list s, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, r is a string containing the characters at the indices of the integers in the list s in the order they appear, t is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The string 'a' remains unchanged. The list 'b' now contains the frequency of each integer in the list 's', where the value at index x represents the number of times the integer x appears in the list 's'. The list 's' is now empty because the loop has iterated over all its elements. The variable 'i' holds the last integer that was processed in the list 's'. The string 'r' contains the characters at the indices of the integers in the list 's', in the order they appeared. The variable 't' remains 0, and the stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.
