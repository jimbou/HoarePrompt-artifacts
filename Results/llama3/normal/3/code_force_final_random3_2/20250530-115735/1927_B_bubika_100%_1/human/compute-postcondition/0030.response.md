Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is 3 and the rest are 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is a list of integers that must have at least n+2 integers, i is the third integer in the list, r is a string containing the character at index x in a plus the character at index x in a plus the character at index x in a, t is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus the first two inputs**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The list `b` has been modified such that the integer at index `x` is now 3, while the rest of the integers remain 0. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The list `s` still has at least `n+2` integers, and `i` is still the third integer in the list. The string `r` now contains the character at index `x` in `a` plus the character at index `x` in `a` plus the character at index `x` in `a`, due to the concatenation operation. The value of `t` remains 2. Finally, stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus the first two inputs.
