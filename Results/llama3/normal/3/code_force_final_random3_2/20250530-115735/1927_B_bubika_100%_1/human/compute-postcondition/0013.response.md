Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is a list of integers, r is an empty string, t is 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the string r is not being printed**

Explanation:
The first line assigns a list of 26 zeros to `b`, replacing its previous value. The second line assigns an integer value from stdin to `n`, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The third line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `s`, which was previously empty. The fourth line assigns an empty string to `r`, replacing its previous value. The value of `a` remains unchanged. The value of `t` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 2. The string `r` is not being printed anymore.
