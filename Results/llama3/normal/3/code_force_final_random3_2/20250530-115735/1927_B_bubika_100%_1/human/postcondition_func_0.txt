This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then maps each integer in the list to a corresponding character in the alphabet (where 0 maps to 'a', 1 maps to 'b', and so on) and prints the resulting string for each test case. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results directly to standard output.
