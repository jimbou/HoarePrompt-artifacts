Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is 2 and all other values are 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1 that must have at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list, r is a string containing the character at index x in string a and the character at index x in string a, t is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this final state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The list `b` has been modified such that the value at index `x` is now 2, while all other values remain 0. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The list `s` still contains `n` integers between 0 and `n-1` and must have at least 2 integers. The value of `i` is still the second integer in the list `s`. The string `r` now contains two characters: the character at index `x` in string `a` (which was already present) and another character at index `x` in string `a` (which was added by the code). The value of `t` remains 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1.
