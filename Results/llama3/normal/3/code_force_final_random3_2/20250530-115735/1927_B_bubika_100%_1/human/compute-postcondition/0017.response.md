Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the integer at index x is 2 and all other integers are 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list, r is a string containing the character at index x in string a plus the character at index x in string a, t is 1, stdin contains 0 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The list `b` has been modified such that the integer at index `x` is now 2, while all other integers remain 0. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The list `s` continues to have at least 2 integers, with `i` being the second integer in the list. The string `r` now contains the character at index `x` in string `a` plus the character at index `x` in string `a`, effectively duplicating the character. The value of `t` remains 1. Lastly, `stdin` still contains 0 test cases.
