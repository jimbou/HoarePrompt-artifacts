Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 integers where the value at index x is 1 and all other values are 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, s is a list of n integers between 0 and n-1 that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, r is a string containing the character at index x in string a, t is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `b` at index `x` is incremented by 1, and the character at index `x` in string `a` is appended to string `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
