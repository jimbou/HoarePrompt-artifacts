The code snippet sorts the list `arr` in ascending order and initializes three new variables: `new_arr` (an empty list), `left` (set to 0), and `right` (set to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`). The sorting operation does not change the length of `arr`, but it rearranges its elements. The other three lines introduce new variables without modifying the existing ones.

Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, and right is n - 1.**
