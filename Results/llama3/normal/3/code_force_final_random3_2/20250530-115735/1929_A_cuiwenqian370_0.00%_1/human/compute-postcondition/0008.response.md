The variables in the loop head are left and right, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables left and right. If left is less than or equal to right, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, left is less than right, left is one more than its original value, and right is one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time left must be less than or equal to right. Since left is one more than its original value and right is one less than its original value, the original left must be less than or equal to the original right. Also, left must be less than or equal to right. Since left is one more than its original value and right is one less than its original value, the original left must be less than or equal to the original right. Also, left must be less than or equal to right. Since left is one more than its original value and right is one less than its original value, the original left must be less than or equal to the original right. Also, left must be less than or equal to right. Since left is one more than its original value and right is one less than its original value, the original left must be less than or equal to the original right. Also, left must be less than or equal to right. Since left is one more than its original value and right is one less than its original value, the original left must be less than or equal to the original right. Also, left must be less than or equal to right. Since left is one more than its original value and right is one less than its original value, the original left must be less than or equal to the original right. Also, left must be less than or equal to right. Since left is one more than its original value and right is one less than its original value, the original left must be less than or equal to the original right. Also, left must be less than or equal to right.
