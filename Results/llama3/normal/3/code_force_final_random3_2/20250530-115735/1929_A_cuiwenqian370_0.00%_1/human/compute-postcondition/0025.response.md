To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3**
