To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `left <= right`. Given the initial states:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i
- `new_arr` is an empty list
- `left` is 0
- `right` is `n - 1`

The variables in the loop head are `left` and `right`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `left` must be less than or equal to `right`. 

Given that `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, and knowing that `n` is at least 2, it is guaranteed that `left` (0) will always be less than or equal to `right` (`n - 1`) because `n - 1` will always be at least 1 when `n` is 2 or more. 

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `left` and `right` for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition `left <= right` is already satisfied given the initial conditions.

State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, and right is n - 1**
