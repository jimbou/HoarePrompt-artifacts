Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `left` is two more than its original value and less than `right`, `right` is two less than its original value, `new_arr` contains one element which is `arr[left]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, the list `arr` remains the same, the value of `left` is still two more than its original value and less than `right`, the value of `right` is still two less than its original value, and a new list `new_arr` is created with one element which is the value at index `left` in the list `arr`.
