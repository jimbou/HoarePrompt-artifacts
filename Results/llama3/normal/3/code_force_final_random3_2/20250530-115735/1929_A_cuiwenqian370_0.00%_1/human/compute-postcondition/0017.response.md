Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is two more than its original value and less than right, right is two less than its original value. If left equals right, new_arr contains one element which is arr[left]. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left].***
