Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is one more than its original value and less than right, right is one less than its original value. If left equals right, new_arr contains one element which is arr[left]. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left].**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The list `arr` also remains the same, as no operations are performed on it. The variables `left` and `right` are updated according to the code: `left` is incremented by 1, and `right` is decremented by 1. As a result, `left` is now one more than its original value and less than `right`, and `right` is one less than its original value. The list `new_arr` is not explicitly modified by the code, but its contents depend on the values of `left` and `right`. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` contains one element, which is `arr[left]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` contains two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`.
