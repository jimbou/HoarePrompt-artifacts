Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by first sorting the array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements from the sorted array. Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement does not require the array to be rearranged in a specific way, but rather to find the maximum beauty that can be obtained by rearranging the elements in any way.

The correct approach would be to simply sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the maximum beauty is achieved when the smallest element is followed by the largest element, the second smallest element is followed by the second largest element, and so on.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
