Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i. left is less than right, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left], left is one more than its original value, right is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `arr` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `left` and `right` are updated according to the code. The value of `new_arr` is also updated to contain two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`. The relationship between `left` and `right` is maintained as `left` is less than `right`.
