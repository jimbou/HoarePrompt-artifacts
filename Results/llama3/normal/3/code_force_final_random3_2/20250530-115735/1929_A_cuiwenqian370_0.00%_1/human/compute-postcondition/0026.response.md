Output State: **`new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1]) + abs(new_arr[3] - new_arr[2])`, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `max_beauty` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between the third and second elements of `new_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
