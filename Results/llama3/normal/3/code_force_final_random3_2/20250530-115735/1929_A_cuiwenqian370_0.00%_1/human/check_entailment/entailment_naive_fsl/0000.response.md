Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this, the program sorts the array and then rearranges it in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

The program uses a two-pointer technique to rearrange the array. It starts from the beginning and end of the sorted array and alternately adds elements to the new array. This ensures that the largest element is always paired with the smallest element, the second largest element is paired with the second smallest element, and so on. This maximizes the differences between consecutive elements and hence maximizes the beauty of the array.

The program also correctly handles the case when the length of the array is odd. In this case, the middle element is added to the new array only once, which is correct because it does not contribute to the beauty of the array.

The program also correctly calculates the maximum beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array and handles all possible cases correctly.
