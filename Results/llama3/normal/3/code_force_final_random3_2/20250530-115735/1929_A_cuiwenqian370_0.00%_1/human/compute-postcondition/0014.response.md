According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is two more than its original value and less than or equal to `right`, and `right` is two less than its original value. `left` being less than or equal to `right` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `left` is less than `right`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is two more than its original value and less than right, right is two less than its original value**
