The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2**
