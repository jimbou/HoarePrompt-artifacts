Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is two more than its original value and less than or equal to right, right is two less than its original value. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing three elements: arr[right], arr[left], and arr[left]. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left].**

In this final state, the values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `left` and `right` are updated based on the given operations. `left` is incremented by 1 and `right` is decremented by 1, resulting in `left` being two more than its original value and `right` being two less than its original value. The condition for `new_arr` remains the same, depending on whether `left` equals `right` or not.
