The code `max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])` updates the value of `max_beauty` by adding the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element in the `new_arr` array.

Since `i` is 2, `new_arr[i]` refers to the third element in the reversed array, and `new_arr[i - 1]` refers to the second element. The absolute difference between these two elements is added to the current value of `max_beauty`, which is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0]) + abs(new_arr[2] - new_arr[1])`, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2**
