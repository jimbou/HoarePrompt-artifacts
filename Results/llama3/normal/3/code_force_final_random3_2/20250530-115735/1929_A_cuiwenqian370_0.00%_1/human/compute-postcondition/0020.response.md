Output State: **`new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, `max_beauty` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `new_arr`, `left`, and `right` remain the same as in the initial state, as the code does not modify them. However, a new variable `max_beauty` is introduced and assigned the value 0.
