Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all `i`, `left` is one more than its original value and less than or equal to `right`, `right` is one less than its original value, `new_arr` is a list containing three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`.**

In this output state, the value of `new_arr` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `arr[left]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their original conditions still hold. The list `new_arr` now contains three elements, with the last two elements being the same, which is `arr[left]`.
