Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is one more than its original value and less than or equal to right, right is one less than its original value, new_arr is a list containing four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged from their initial state. The only modification is to the `new_arr` list, which initially contained two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`. After executing the code, `new_arr` is appended with `arr[right]` and `arr[left]` again, resulting in a list containing four elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]`.
