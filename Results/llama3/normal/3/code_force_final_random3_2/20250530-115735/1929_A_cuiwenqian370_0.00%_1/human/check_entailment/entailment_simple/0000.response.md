Reasoning: The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program sorts the array in ascending order, then creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. It then calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

However, the program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum beauty. The current implementation calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array, which is not the correct formula for calculating the maximum beauty.

The correct formula for calculating the maximum beauty is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the new array, not the absolute differences. This is because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n, which can be negative.

Therefore, the program should calculate the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the new array, not the absolute differences.

Correctness: **False**
