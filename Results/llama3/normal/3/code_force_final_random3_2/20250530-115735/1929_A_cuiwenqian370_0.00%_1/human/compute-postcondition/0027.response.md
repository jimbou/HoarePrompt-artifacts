Output State: **`new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`, `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the array `new_arr` still contains the elements of `arr` in reverse order, and the variables `left` and `right` maintain their relationship. The variable `max_beauty` now holds the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`. The loop has iterated `n-1` times, where `n` is the length of the original array `arr`, and the loop counter `i` has reached `n-1`.
