Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left], left is less than right**

The code appends the elements at the right and left indices of the sorted list arr to the new_arr list. Since arr is sorted, the element at the right index is greater than or equal to the element at the left index. The values of n, arr, and the relationship between left and right remain unchanged. The only modification is the addition of two elements to the new_arr list.
