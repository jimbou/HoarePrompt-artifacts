Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, and right is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
while left <= right:
    if left == right:
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    else:
        new_arr.append(arr[right])
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    left += 1
    right -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i. left is less than right, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left], left is one more than its original value, right is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is two more than its original value and less than or equal to right, right is two less than its original value. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing three elements: arr[right], arr[left], and arr[left]. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing four elements: arr[right], arr[left], arr[right], and arr[left].
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is one more than its original value and less than right, right is one less than its original value. If left equals right, new_arr contains one element which is arr[left]. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left].


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
