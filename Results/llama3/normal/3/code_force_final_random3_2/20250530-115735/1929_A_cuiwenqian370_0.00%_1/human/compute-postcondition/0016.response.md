Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, left is two more than its original value and less than right, right is two less than its original value, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged from the initial state, as they are not modified by the code. The code only appends two elements to the `new_arr` list, which is initially empty. The first element appended is `arr[right]`, and the second element is `arr[left]`. The resulting `new_arr` list contains these two elements in the specified order.
