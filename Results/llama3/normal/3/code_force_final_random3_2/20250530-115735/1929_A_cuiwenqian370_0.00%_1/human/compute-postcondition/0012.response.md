Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all `i`, `left` is one more than its original value and less than or equal to `right`, `right` is one less than its original value. If `left` equals `right`, `new_arr` is a list containing three elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, and `arr[left]`. Otherwise, `new_arr` is a list containing four elements: `arr[right]`, `arr[left]`, `arr[right]`, and `arr[left]`.***
