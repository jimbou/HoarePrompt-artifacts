Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i. If left equals right, new_arr is a list containing one integer element, which is the element at index left of arr. Otherwise, new_arr is a list containing two elements: arr[right] and arr[left], and left is less than right.***
