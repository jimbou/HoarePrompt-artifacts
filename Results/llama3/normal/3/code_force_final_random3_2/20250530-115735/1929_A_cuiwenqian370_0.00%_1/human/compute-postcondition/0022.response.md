Output State: **`new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, `max_beauty` is `abs(new_arr[1] - new_arr[0])`, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `max_beauty` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the first two elements of `new_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
