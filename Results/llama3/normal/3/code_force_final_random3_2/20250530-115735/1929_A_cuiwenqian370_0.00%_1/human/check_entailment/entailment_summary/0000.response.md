Reasoning:
The program is attempting to solve the problem by rearranging the array elements to maximize the beauty of the array. The function `func_1` sorts the input array in ascending order, then creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements from the sorted array. This is done to maximize the differences between consecutive elements, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

However, the program does not actually reverse the input array as stated in the execution summary. Instead, it creates a new array with the elements rearranged in a specific way. The program then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in this new array, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.

Despite the incorrect statement in the execution summary, the program is actually correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
