To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1). Before the loop starts, `new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, and `max_beauty` is 0. However, these states do not guarantee the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 2 and `i` to be 1.

State: **`new_arr` contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order, `left` equals `right` plus one, `right` equals its original value minus `left`, `max_beauty` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
