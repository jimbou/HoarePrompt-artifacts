The code `new_arr.append(arr[left])` appends the element at index `left` of the sorted list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers and `left` is an index, the appended element is an integer such that 1 <= arr[left] <= 10^9. The value of `left` is not changed by this code. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `right` are not affected by this code. Since `new_arr` was initially empty, it now contains one element, which is the element at index `left` of `arr`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `new_arr` is a list containing one integer element, which is the element at index `left` of `arr`, and the current values of `left` and `right` are equal.**
