Reasoning:

The problem asks for the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

The given program first sorts the array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This is done to maximize the beauty of the array, as the largest differences between consecutive elements will be achieved by placing the largest element next to the smallest element, the second largest element next to the second smallest element, and so on.

Finally, the program calculates the beauty of the new array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The program's approach is correct because it maximizes the beauty of the array by placing the largest and smallest elements next to each other, which results in the largest possible differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **True**
