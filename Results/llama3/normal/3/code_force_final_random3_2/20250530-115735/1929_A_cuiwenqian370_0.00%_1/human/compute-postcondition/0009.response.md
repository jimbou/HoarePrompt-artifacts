According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is one more than its original value and `right` is one less than its original value. Since `left` is less than `right` originally, we need to adjust the state so that `left` is still less than or equal to `right` after the increment and decrement.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all `i`, `left` is one more than its original value and less than or equal to `right`, `right` is one less than its original value, `new_arr` is a list containing two elements: `arr[right]` and `arr[left]`**
