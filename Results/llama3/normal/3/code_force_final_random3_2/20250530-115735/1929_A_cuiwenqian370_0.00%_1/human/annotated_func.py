#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and arr is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i.

    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the reversed array `arr`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reverses the input array and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the reversed array.
