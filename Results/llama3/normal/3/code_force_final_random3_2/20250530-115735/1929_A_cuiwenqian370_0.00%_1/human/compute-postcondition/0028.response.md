Output State: **The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the reversed array `arr`.**

In this output state, `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`, which contains all elements of `arr` in reverse order. This means that `max_beauty` represents the total absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements in the reversed array `arr`.
