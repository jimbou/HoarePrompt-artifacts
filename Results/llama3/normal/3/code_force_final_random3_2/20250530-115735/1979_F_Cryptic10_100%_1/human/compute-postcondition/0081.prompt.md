Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `ops` is an empty list, and the integer input is greater than 2. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 1 tuples (`v1`, `v2`). If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input. The following is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the elements of `p1` and `p2` in reverse order, separated by spaces.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed, ops is a list containing one tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise a list containing two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and the integer input is at least 4.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed, ops is a list containing one tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise a list containing two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and the integer input is at least 5, v1 and v2 are the first two elements of the list returned by q(len(vx) - 2).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed and its size must be greater than 2, ops is a list containing one tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise a list containing two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and the integer input is at least 5, v1 and v2 are the first two elements of the list returned by q(len(vx) - 2), vx has one less element than before. If v2 > 0, ops contains two tuples (v1, v2) and (v1, v2). Otherwise, ops contains three tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v3, 0).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
