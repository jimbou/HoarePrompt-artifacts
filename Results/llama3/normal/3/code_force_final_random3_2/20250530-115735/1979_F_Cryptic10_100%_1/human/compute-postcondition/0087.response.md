To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the `ops` list in reverse order.

The current state is:

* `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output
* `_` is 2
* `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive)
* `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list
* `v1` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`
* `v2` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`
* `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed
* `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 2 tuples
* The integer input is greater than 2
* If `p1[-1] == v2` then `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended, otherwise `p1` is a list of integers with `v1` appended

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* Since we are iterating over `ops` in reverse order, the next tuple to be processed will be the one before the current `v1` and `v2`.
* The value of `v1` and `v2` will change to the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.
* The value of `p1` and `p2` will depend on the new values of `v1` and `v2`.

State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2`, otherwise `p1` remains the same, `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the third last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the third last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 2 tuples, and the integer input is greater than 2**
