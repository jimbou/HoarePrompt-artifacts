Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `vx` contains at least 2 distinct integers from the input, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple `(v1, v2)`, and the integer input is greater than 1. The current value of `v2` is greater than 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The function `q` remains unchanged, the variable `_` is still 1, the lists `p1` and `p2` are unchanged, the values of `v1` and `v2` are now the second and first elements of the last tuple in the list `ops`, respectively, the list `vx` still contains at least 2 distinct integers from the input, and the list `ops` now contains at least one tuple `(v1, v2)`. The integer input is still greater than 1, and the value of `v2` is still greater than 0.
