Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is equal to the number of test cases minus one, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2`, otherwise `p1` remains the same, `p2` is a list of integers with all `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, and the following is printed: "! [p1 elements in reverse order followed by p2 elements]"**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the function `q` remains unchanged, the loop counter `_` reaches the number of test cases minus one, the set `vx` is empty, the list `ops` is empty, and the lists `p1` and `p2` contain the integers from the input, with `p1` containing all integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) and `p2` containing the remaining integers. The output is printed in the format "! [p1 elements in reverse order followed by p2 elements]".
