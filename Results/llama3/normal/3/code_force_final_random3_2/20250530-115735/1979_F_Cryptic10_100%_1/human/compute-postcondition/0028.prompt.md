Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input that must have at least 2 tuples, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the second last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`, and either `p1` or `p2` has an additional element `v1` appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, and either `p1` or `p2` has an additional element `v1` appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
