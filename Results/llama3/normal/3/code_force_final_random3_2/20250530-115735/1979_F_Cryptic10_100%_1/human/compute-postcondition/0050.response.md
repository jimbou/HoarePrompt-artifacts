Output State: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 1, p1 is a list containing two integers from the input, p2 is a list containing either the same two integers as p1 and the second element of the last tuple in ops or just the second element of the last tuple in ops, v1 is the second element of the last tuple in ops, v2 is the first element of the last tuple in ops, vx is an empty set, ops is a list containing at least one tuple (v1, v2), and the integer input is greater than 1. If v2 > 0, ops contains at least len(vx) - 2 tuples (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), where v3 is an integer from the input.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the function q remains unchanged, the variable _ remains 1, the lists p1 and p2 remain unchanged, the variables v1 and v2 are updated to the last tuple in ops, the set vx is empty, and the list ops contains at least one tuple (v1, v2). If v2 is greater than 0, ops contains at least len(vx) - 2 tuples (v1, v2). If v2 is less than or equal to 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), where v3 is an integer from the input.
