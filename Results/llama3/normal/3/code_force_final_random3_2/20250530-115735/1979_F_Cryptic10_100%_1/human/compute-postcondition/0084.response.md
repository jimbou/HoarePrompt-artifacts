Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 1 tuple, and the integer input is greater than 2, `(v1, v2)` is the last tuple in ops**

In natural language, the output state is: The function `q` remains unchanged. The value of `_` is still 2. The list `p1` remains the same, containing integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive). The list `p2` is updated to include the value `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, otherwise it remains an empty list. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `vx`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The integer input is still greater than 2, and `(v1, v2)` is still the last tuple in `ops`.
