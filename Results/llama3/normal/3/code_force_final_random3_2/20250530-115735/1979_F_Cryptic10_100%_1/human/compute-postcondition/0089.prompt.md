Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and the integer input is greater than 2.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 1 tuple, and the integer input is greater than 2, `(v1, v2)` is the last tuple in ops

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 2 tuples, and the integer input is greater than 2, and if `p1[-1] == v2` then `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended, otherwise `p1` is a list of integers with `v1` appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2`, otherwise `p1` remains the same, `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the third last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the third last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 2 tuples, and the integer input is greater than 2, and either `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
