Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed, ops is a list containing two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and the integer input is at least 5, v1 and v2 are the first two elements of the list returned by q(len(vx) - 2).**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The function q remains unchanged, taking an integer d and returning a list of integers from the input after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. The value of _ is still 2. The lists p1 and p2 are either empty or contain the value v1. The values of v1 and v2 are the first two elements of the first tuple in ops. The set vx contains integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), with v1 removed if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise with both v1 and v3 removed. The list ops now contains two tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). The integer input is still at least 5. The values of v1 and v2 are the first two elements of the list returned by q(len(vx) - 2).
