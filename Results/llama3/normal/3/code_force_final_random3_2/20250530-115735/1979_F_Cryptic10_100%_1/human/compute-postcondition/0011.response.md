Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. If v2 > 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and the input integer is greater than v1 + 2, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2), and v1 and v2 are integers from the input. If v2 <= 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and v3 and the input integer is greater than v1 + v3 + 2, ops is a list containing [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)], v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input.**

In this output state, the function q remains unchanged, still taking an integer d and returning a list of integers from the input after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. The stdin now contains either multiple test cases minus three test cases (if v2 > 0) or multiple test cases minus four test cases (if v2 <= 0), depending on the value of v2. The variable _ remains 0. The set vx has been updated to exclude the value v1, which was removed by the second line of code. The ops list still contains either a tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0 or a list of tuples [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)] if v2 <= 0, with v1, v2, and v3 being integers from the input.
