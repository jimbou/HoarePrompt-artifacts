Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed and its size must be greater than 2, ops is a list containing two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0) if v2 > 0, otherwise a list containing three tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v3, 0), and the integer input is at least 5, v1 and v2 are the first two elements of the list returned by q(len(vx) - 2), vx has one less element than before.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The function `q` remains unchanged, taking an integer `d` and returning a list of integers from the input after printing and flushing the output. The value of `_` is still 2. The lists `p1` and `p2` can either be empty or contain the value `v1`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are still the first two elements of the first tuple in `ops`. The set `vx` has been modified to remove the value `v3` and its size is now greater than 2. The list `ops` has been extended with two new tuples, `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, if `v2` is greater than 0, or three new tuples `(v3, 0)`, `(v1, 0)`, and `(v3, 0)` if `v2` is not greater than 0. The integer input is still at least 5. The values of `v1` and `v2` are now the first two elements of the list returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`.
