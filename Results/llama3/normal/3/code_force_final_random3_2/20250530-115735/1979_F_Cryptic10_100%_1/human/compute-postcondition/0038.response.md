Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 1, p1 is a list containing two integers from the input, p2 is a list containing either the same two integers as p1 and the second element of the last tuple in ops or just the second element of the last tuple in ops, v1 is the second element of the last tuple in ops, v2 is the first element of the last tuple in ops, vx contains at least 1 distinct integer from the input, ops is a list containing the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), v3 is an integer from the input, and v2 is less than or equal to 0**

In this final state, the function q remains unchanged. The variable _ still holds the value 1. The lists p1 and p2 retain their original values, as they are not modified by the code. The variables v1 and v2 also keep their original values, as they are not reassigned. The list vx has one less distinct integer from the input, as v3 is removed from it. The list ops is extended with two new tuples: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). The variable v3 is assigned an integer value from the input. The value of v2 remains less than or equal to 0, as it is not modified by the code.
