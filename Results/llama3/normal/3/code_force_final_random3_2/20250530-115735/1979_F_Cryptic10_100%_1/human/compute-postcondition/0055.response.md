To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the `ops` list in reverse order.

From the given state, we know that `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple `(v1, v2)`. To execute the loop again, there must be another tuple in the `ops` list that we haven't processed yet.

Since we are iterating in reverse order, the next tuple to be processed would be the one before the current `v1` and `v2`. Let's call this new tuple `(v1_new, v2_new)`.

For the loop to execute again, the following conditions must be met:

1. `ops` must contain at least one more tuple, i.e., `len(ops) > 1`.
2. The new tuple `(v1_new, v2_new)` must be the one before the current `v1` and `v2` in the reversed `ops` list.

Now, let's adjust the states accordingly:

* `v1` and `v2` will take the values of `v1_new` and `v2_new`, respectively.
* `ops` will still be a list containing at least one tuple, but we know that it has at least one more tuple than before.
* The other variables (`q`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `vx`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new`, `v1` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples (`v1_new`, `v2_new`) and (`v1`, `v2`), and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2_new` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1_new`, `v2_new`). If `v2_new` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1_new`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.**
