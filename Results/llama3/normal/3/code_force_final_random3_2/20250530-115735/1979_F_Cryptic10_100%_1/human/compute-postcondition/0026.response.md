To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the `ops` list in reverse order.

The current state is:

* `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output
* `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input
* `_` is 0
* `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input that must have at least 2 tuples
* `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input
* `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the second last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`
* `v1` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`
* `v2` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`
* Either `p1` or `p2` has an additional element `v1` appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* Since we are iterating over `ops` in reverse order, the next tuple to be processed will be the one before the current `v1` and `v2`.
* The `ops` list must have at least one more tuple for the loop to execute again.
* The values of `v1` and `v2` will be updated to the next tuple in the reversed `ops` list.
* The values of `p1` and `p2` may change depending on the new values of `v1` and `v2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, and either `p1` or `p2` has an additional element `v1` appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`**
