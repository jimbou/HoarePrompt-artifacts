The only variable in the loop head is variable vx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable vx.  If vx is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed. For the loop to be executed one more time, vx must be greater than 2. So vx must be a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed and its size must be greater than 2.
State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed and its size must be greater than 2, ops is a list containing one tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise a list containing two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and the integer input is at least 5, v1 and v2 are the first two elements of the list returned by q(len(vx) - 2)**
