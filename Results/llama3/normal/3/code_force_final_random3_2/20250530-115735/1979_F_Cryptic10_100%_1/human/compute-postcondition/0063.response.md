Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `ops` is an empty list, and the integer input is greater than 2. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 1 tuples (`v1`, `v2`). If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input. The following is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the elements of `p1` and `p2` in reverse order, separated by spaces.**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, `v2`, and the integer input remain unchanged. The value of `vx` is updated to a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), and the value of `ops` is reset to an empty list. The conditions related to `v2` and `ops` are still valid, and the printed message remains the same.
