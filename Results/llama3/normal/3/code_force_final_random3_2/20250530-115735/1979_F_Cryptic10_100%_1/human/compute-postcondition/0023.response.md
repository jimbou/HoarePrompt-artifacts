Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input that must have at least 1 tuple, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`.**

In this output state, the value of `p2` is determined by the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If this condition is true, `p2` will be the same as `p1` with the second element of the last tuple in `ops` appended to it. If the condition is false, `p2` will be a list containing only the second element of the last tuple in `ops`. The other variables remain unchanged.
