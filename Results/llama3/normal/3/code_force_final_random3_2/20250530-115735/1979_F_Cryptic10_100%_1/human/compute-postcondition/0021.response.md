Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `vx`, `_`, and `ops` remain unchanged from the initial state. The new variables `p1` and `p2` are introduced, where `p1` is a list containing the same two integers as the set `vx`, and `p2` is an empty list.
