Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with `v1` removed if `v2` > 0, otherwise with `v1` and `v3` removed and its size must be greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(v1, v2)` and `(v1, v2)`, and the integer input is at least 5, `v1` and `v2` are the first two elements of the list returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `vx` has one less element than before.**

In this output state, the list `ops` has been updated to include a new tuple `(v1, v2)`, which is a copy of the first tuple in `ops`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `vx` still has one less element than before, as its size was reduced by 1 in the previous step.
