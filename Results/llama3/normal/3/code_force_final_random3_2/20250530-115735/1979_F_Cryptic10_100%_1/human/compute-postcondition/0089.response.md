Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2`, otherwise `p1` remains the same, `p2` is a list of integers with all `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is an empty list, and the integer input is greater than 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the function `q` remains unchanged, the variable `_` remains 2, the list `p1` will have all `v1` values appended to it if the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, otherwise it remains the same, the list `p2` will have all `v1` values appended to it if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, otherwise it remains an empty list, the variables `v1` and `v2` are reset to the first tuple in `ops`, the set `vx` remains empty, the list `ops` is empty, and the integer input remains greater than 2.
