Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` and `v1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, or `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` and `v1` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is the first element of the tuple before the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the tuple before the second last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2_new` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1_new`, `v2_new`). If `v2_new` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1_new`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.**

In this output state, the value of `p1` and `p2` has been updated based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p1`, otherwise `v1` is appended to `p2`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
