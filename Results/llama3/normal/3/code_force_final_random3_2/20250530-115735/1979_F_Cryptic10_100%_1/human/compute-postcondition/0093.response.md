Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive. It then performs a series of operations on the input integer, including removing elements from a set, appending elements to lists, and printing output in a specific format. The function ultimately prints the final state of the program, which includes the remaining elements in the set and the appended lists, in a specific order.**
