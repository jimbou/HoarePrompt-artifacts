Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple (`v1`, `v2`), and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1`, `v2`). If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.**

In this output state, either `p1` or `p2` has been appended with `v1`, depending on whether the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
