Postcondition: ***q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 1, p1 is a list containing two integers from the input, p2 is a list containing either the same two integers as p1 and the second element of the last tuple in ops or just the second element of the last tuple in ops, v1 is the second element of the last tuple in ops, v2 is the first element of the last tuple in ops, vx contains at least 2 distinct integers from the input if v2 > 0, otherwise vx contains at least 1 distinct integer from the input, ops is a list containing at least one tuple (v1, v2), and the integer input is greater than 1. If v2 > 0, ops contains at least one tuple (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), where v3 is an integer from the input.***
