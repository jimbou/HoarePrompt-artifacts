Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 and v3 removed, ops is a list containing two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), the integer input is at least 4, and v2 is less than or equal to 0, v3 is an integer from the input.**

The code executes as follows: The first line calls the function q with argument 0, prints '? 0' and flushes the output, and assigns the returned list of integers to v3 and _. Since _ was 2, it is now reassigned to the second element of the returned list. The second line removes v3 from the set vx. The third line appends two tuples to the list ops: (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). The value of v1 is now the first element of the first tuple in ops, and the value of v2 is now the second element of the first tuple in ops. The set vx now contains all integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with both v1 and v3 removed.
