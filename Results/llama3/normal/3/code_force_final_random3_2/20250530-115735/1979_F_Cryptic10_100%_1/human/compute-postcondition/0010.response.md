According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable vx.  If vx is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1, or a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and v3. For the loop to be executed one more time, the input integer must be greater than v1 + 2, or greater than v1 + v3 + 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. If v2 > 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and the input integer is greater than v1 + 2, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2), and v1 and v2 are integers from the input. If v2 <= 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and v3 and the input integer is greater than v1 + v3 + 2, ops is a list containing [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)], v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input.**
