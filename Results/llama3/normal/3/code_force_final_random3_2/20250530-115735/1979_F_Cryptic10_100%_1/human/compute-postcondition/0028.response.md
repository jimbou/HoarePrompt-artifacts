Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, and either `p1` or `p2` has additional elements appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` for each tuple in `ops`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the function `q` remains unchanged, the set `vx` remains unchanged, the variable `_` remains 0, the list `ops` becomes empty, the list `p1` remains unchanged, and the list `p2` contains either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`. The variables `v1` and `v2` are the second and first elements of the last tuple in `ops`, respectively. Either `p1` or `p2` has additional elements appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` for each tuple in `ops`.
