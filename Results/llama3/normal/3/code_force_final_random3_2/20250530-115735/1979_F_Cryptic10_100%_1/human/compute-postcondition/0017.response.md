Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `v1` is an integer from the input, `v2` is an integer from the input, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus `v1` and the input integer minus one, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing a tuple (`v1`, `v2`) and another tuple (`v1`, `v2`) if `v2` > 0, or a list containing [(`v3`, 0), (`v1`, 0)] and another tuple (`v1`, `v2`) if `v2` <= 0, and `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are integers from the input, and `ops` has an additional tuple (`v1`, `v2`) appended to it.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the `ops` list has an additional tuple (`v1`, `v2`) appended to it. The values of the other variables remain the same.
