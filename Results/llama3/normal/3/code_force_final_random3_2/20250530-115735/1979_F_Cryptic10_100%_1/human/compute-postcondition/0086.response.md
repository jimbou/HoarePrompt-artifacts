Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 2 tuples, and the integer input is greater than 2, and if `p1[-1] == v2` then `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended, otherwise `p1` is a list of integers with `v1` appended.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`, otherwise `v1` is appended to `p1`.
