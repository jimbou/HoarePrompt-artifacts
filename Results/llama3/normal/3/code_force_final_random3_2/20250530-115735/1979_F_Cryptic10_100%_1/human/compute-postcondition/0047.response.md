Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 1, p1 is a list containing two integers from the input, p2 is a list containing either the same two integers as p1 and the second element of the last tuple in ops or just the second element of the last tuple in ops, v1 is the second element of the last tuple in ops, v2 is the first element of the last tuple in ops, vx contains more than 1 distinct integers from the input, ops is a list containing at least two tuples (v1, v2), and the integer input is greater than 1. If v2 > 0, ops contains at least three tuples (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, 0), where v3 is an integer from the input.**

In this output state, the values of q, _, p1, p2, v1, v2, vx, and the integer input remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the ops list, which now contains an additional tuple (v1, v2). If v2 > 0, ops contains at least three tuples (v1, v2), and if v2 <= 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v1, 0).
