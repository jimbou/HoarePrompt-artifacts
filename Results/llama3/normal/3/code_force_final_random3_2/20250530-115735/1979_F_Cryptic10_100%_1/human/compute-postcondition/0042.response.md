Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `vx` contains more than 1 distinct integers from the input, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, the first of which is `(v1, v2)` and the last of which is `(v1, v2)`, and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least two tuples `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, where `v3` is an integer from the input.**

In this output state, the code has appended a new tuple `(v1, v2)` to the end of the `ops` list, while keeping all other variables unchanged. The `ops` list now contains at least two tuples, with the first and last tuples being `(v1, v2)`. The conditions on `v2` and the contents of `ops` are also updated accordingly.
