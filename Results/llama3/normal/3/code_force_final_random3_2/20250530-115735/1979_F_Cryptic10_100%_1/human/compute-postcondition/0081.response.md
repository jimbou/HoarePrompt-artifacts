Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, ops is a list containing tuples (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise a list containing tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and the integer input is greater than 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The function q remains unchanged, taking an integer d and returning a list of integers from the input after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. The variable _ remains 2. The lists p1 and p2 can be either empty or contain the value v1. The variable v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, and v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops. The set vx is empty, as all elements have been removed. The list ops contains tuples (v1, v2) if v2 is greater than 0, otherwise it contains tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0). The integer input is greater than 2.
