Output: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, and either `p1` or `p2` has additional elements appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2` for each tuple in `ops`, and this is printed: "! [p1[-1], p1[-2], ..., p1[0], p2[0], p2[1], ..., p2[-1]]" where p1 and p2 are lists of integers from the input**
