Postcondition: ***q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. If v2 > 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2), and v1 and v2 are integers from the input. If v2 <= 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and v3, ops is a list containing [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)], v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input.***
