Output State: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 1, p1 is a list containing two integers from the input, p2 is a list containing either the same two integers as p1 and the second element of the last tuple in ops or just the second element of the last tuple in ops, v1 is the second element of the last tuple in ops, v2 is the first element of the last tuple in ops, vx is an empty set, ops is a list containing at least one tuple (v1, v2), and the integer input is greater than 1. If v2 > 0, ops contains at least len(vx) - 2 tuples (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), where v3 is an integer from the input.

This output state indicates that the loop has executed until the length of vx is less than or equal to 2. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
