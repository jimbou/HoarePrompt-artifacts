Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set containing integers from the input, `ops` is a list, and the integer input is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the values of `q`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. The value of `vx` is updated to a set containing integers from the input, and the value of `ops` is updated to an empty list. The integer input is still greater than 1.
