Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, the function `q` is defined to take an integer `d` as input, print '? %d' % d with flush=True, and then return a list of integers from the input using map(int, input().split()). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the input() function inside the `q` function.
