Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and the integer input is greater than 2.**

In this output state, the values of `p1` and `p2` have been updated. `p1` is now a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), and `p2` is an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.
