Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is an empty list, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple (`v1`, `v2`), and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1`, `v2`). If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.**

In this output state, the values of `p1` and `p2` have been updated to empty lists, as they are now assigned the values of `list(vx)` and `[]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
