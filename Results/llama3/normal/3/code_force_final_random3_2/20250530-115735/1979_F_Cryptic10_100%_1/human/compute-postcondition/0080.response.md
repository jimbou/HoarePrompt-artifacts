Postcondition: ***q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 2, p1 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, p2 is either an empty list or a list containing v1, v1 is the first element of the first tuple in ops, v2 is the second element of the first tuple in ops, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with v1 removed if v2 > 0, otherwise with v1 and v3 removed and its size must be greater than 2, ops is a list containing one tuple (v1, v2) if v2 > 0, otherwise a list containing two tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), and the integer input is at least 5, v1 and v2 are the first two elements of the list returned by q(len(vx) - 2), vx has one less element than before. If v2 > 0, ops contains two tuples (v1, v2) and (v1, v2). Otherwise, ops contains three tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and (v3, 0).***
