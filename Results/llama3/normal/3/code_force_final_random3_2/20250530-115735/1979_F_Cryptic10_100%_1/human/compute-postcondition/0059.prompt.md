Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is an empty list, `p2` is an empty list, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple (`v1`, `v2`), and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1`, `v2`). If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least one tuple (`v1`, `v2`), and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1`, `v2`). If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` and `v1` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` and `v1` is appended to `p1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples (`v1_new`, `v2_new`) and (`v1`, `v2`), and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2_new` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1_new`, `v2_new`). If `v2_new` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1_new`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` and `v1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, or `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` and `v1` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is the first element of the tuple before the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the tuple before the second last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples, and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2_new` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1_new`, `v2_new`). If `v2_new` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1_new`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
