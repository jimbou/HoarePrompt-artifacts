Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. If v2 > 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and the input integer is greater than v1 + 2, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2) and a tuple (v3, 0) and a tuple (v1, 0), and v1 and v2 are integers from the input. If v2 <= 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and v3 and the input integer is greater than v1 + v3 + 2, ops is a list containing a tuple (v3, 0), a tuple (v1, 0), a tuple (v3, 0), and a tuple (v1, 0), v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input.**
