According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `vx`. If `vx` has more than 2 elements, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer. The input integer must be at least 3 for `vx` to have more than 2 elements.

State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, input is at least 3, _ is 0, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer, `ops` is an empty list**
