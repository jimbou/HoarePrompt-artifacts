Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, input is at least 1, _ is 0, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer, `ops` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. If v2 > 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2), and v1 and v2 are integers from the input. If v2 <= 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and v3, ops is a list containing [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)], v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output. If v2 > 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and the input integer is greater than v1 + 2, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2) and another tuple (v1, v2), and v1 and v2 are integers from the input. If v2 <= 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1 and v3 and the input integer is greater than v1 + v3 + 2, ops is a list containing [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)] and another tuple (v1, v2), v1, v2, and v3 are integers from the input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `v1` is an integer from the input, `v2` is an integer from the input, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus `v1` and the input integer minus one, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing a tuple (`v1`, `v2`) and another tuple (`v1`, `v2`) if `v2` > 0, or a list containing [(`v3`, 0), (`v1`, 0)] and another tuple (`v1`, `v2`) if `v2` <= 0, and `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are integers from the input. If `v2` > 0, `ops` has an additional tuple (`v1`, `v2`) appended to it. If `v2` <= 0, `vx` has `v3` removed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
