Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, input is at least 1, _ is 0, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer, `ops` is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer, which is at least 1. The value of `ops` is an empty list. The function `q` and the variable `_` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, since one test case was consumed by the `int(input())` expression.
