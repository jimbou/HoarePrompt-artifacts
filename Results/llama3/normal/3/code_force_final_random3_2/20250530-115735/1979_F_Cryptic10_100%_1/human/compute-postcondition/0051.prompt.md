Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set containing integers from the input, `ops` is a list, and the integer input is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 1, p1 is a list containing two integers from the input, p2 is a list containing either the same two integers as p1 and the second element of the last tuple in ops or just the second element of the last tuple in ops, v1 is the second element of the last tuple in ops, v2 is the first element of the last tuple in ops, vx contains at least 2 distinct integers from the input if v2 > 0, otherwise vx contains at least 1 distinct integer from the input, ops is a list containing at least one tuple (v1, v2), and the integer input is greater than 1. If v2 > 0, ops contains at least one tuple (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), where v3 is an integer from the input.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 1, p1 is a list containing two integers from the input, p2 is a list containing either the same two integers as p1 and the second element of the last tuple in ops or just the second element of the last tuple in ops, v1 is the second element of the last tuple in ops, v2 is the first element of the last tuple in ops, vx contains more than 1 distinct integers from the input, ops is a list containing at least one tuple (v1, v2), and the integer input is greater than 1. If v2 > 0, ops contains at least two tuples (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), where v3 is an integer from the input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, _ is 1, p1 is a list containing two integers from the input, p2 is a list containing either the same two integers as p1 and the second element of the last tuple in ops or just the second element of the last tuple in ops, v1 is the second element of the last tuple in ops, v2 is the first element of the last tuple in ops, vx contains more than 1 distinct integers from the input, ops is a list containing at least one tuple (v1, v2), and the integer input is greater than 1. If v2 > 0, ops contains at least two tuples (v1, v2). If v2 <= 0, ops contains the tuples (v3, 0) and (v1, 0), where v3 is an integer from the input. If v2 > 0, ops contains at least three tuples (v1, v2).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
