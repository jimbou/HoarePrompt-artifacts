Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` and `v1` if `p1[-1]` is not equal to `v2`, or `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1_new` and `v1` is appended to `p1` if `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list containing at least two tuples (`v1_new`, `v2_new`) and (`v1`, `v2`), and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2_new` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1_new`, `v2_new`). If `v2_new` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1_new`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is that the function `q` and variables `_`, `v1`, `v2`, `vx`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The lists `p1` and `p2` are updated based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. If the condition is true, `v1` is appended to `p1`; otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p2`. The integer input and the tuples in `ops` also remain unchanged.
