According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the _ is 0.
State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, input is at least 1, _ is 0**
