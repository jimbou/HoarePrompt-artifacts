Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `vx` is a set containing two integers from the input, `_` is 0, `ops` is a list containing tuples of integers from the input that must have at least 2 tuples, `p1` is a list containing two integers from the input, `p2` is a list containing either the same two integers as `p1` and the second element of the second last tuple in `ops` or just the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v1` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`, and either `p1` or `p2` has an additional element `v1` appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the function `q`, set `vx`, variable `_`, list `ops`, and variables `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged. The list `p1` or `p2` has an additional element `v1` appended to it, depending on whether the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.
