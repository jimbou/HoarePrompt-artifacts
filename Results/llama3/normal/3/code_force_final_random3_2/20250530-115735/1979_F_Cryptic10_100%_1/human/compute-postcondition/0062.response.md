State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is an empty list, and the integer input is greater than 2. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 1 tuples (`v1`, `v2`). If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input. The following is printed: "! " followed by the concatenation of the elements of `p1` and `p2` in reverse order, separated by spaces.**
