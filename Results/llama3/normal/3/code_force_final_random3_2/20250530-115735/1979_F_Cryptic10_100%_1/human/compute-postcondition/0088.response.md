Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2`, otherwise `p1` remains the same, `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the third last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the third last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 2 tuples, and the integer input is greater than 2, and either `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it.**

In this output state, either `p1` or `p2` has `v1` appended to it, depending on whether `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
