Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 1, `p1` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `p2` is either an empty list or a list containing `v1`, `v1` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`, `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is an empty list, and the integer input is greater than 1. If `v2` > 0, `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples (`v1`, `v2`). If `v2` <= 0, `ops` contains the tuples (`v3`, 0) and (`v1`, 0), where `v3` is an integer from the input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the function `q` remains unchanged, the variable `_` remains 1, the lists `p1` and `p2` are either empty or contain the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, the variables `v1` and `v2` are the first and second elements of the first tuple in `ops`, the set `vx` is empty, and the list `ops` is empty. The integer input is still greater than 1. If the second element of the first tuple in `ops` is greater than 0, then `ops` contains at least `len(vx)` - 2 tuples with the same elements as the first tuple. If the second element of the first tuple in `ops` is less than or equal to 0, then `ops` contains two tuples: one with an integer from the input and 0, and the other with the first element of the first tuple and 0.
