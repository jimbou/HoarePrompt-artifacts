Output State: **q is a function that takes an integer d and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, _ is 0, vx is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer minus v1, ops is a list containing a tuple (v1, v2), and v1 is an integer from the input, and the current value of v2 is an integer from the input and is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The function q remains unchanged, the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, the variable _ remains 0, the set vx remains unchanged, the list ops now contains a tuple (v1, v2) which is a combination of the input integer v1 and the current value of v2, and the values of v1 and v2 remain unchanged.
