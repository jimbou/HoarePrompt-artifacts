To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for (v1, v2) in ops[::-1]:`.

1. `ops` is a list of tuples, and we are iterating over it in reverse order using `[::-1]`.
2. `(v1, v2)` is the last tuple in `ops` at the end of the previous iteration.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `ops` and `(v1, v2)`.

* `ops` must have at least one more tuple for the loop to execute again.
* Since we are iterating in reverse order, the next tuple to be processed should be the second last tuple in `ops`.

State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` and returns a list of integers from the input, after printing '? %d' % d and flushing the output, `_` is 2, `p1` is a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive), `p2` is a list of integers with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `p2` remains an empty list, `v1` is the first element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the second last tuple in `ops`, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input integer (exclusive) with all elements removed, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise a list containing tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` with at least 2 tuples, and the integer input is greater than 2**
