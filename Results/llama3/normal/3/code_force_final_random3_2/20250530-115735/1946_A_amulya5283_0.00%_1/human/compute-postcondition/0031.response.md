Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed for each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed for the last test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the test cases, and the results list contains the number of operations performed for each test case. The loop variables `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` have their values updated to reflect the last test case processed. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and the `results` list contains the accumulated results of all the test cases.
