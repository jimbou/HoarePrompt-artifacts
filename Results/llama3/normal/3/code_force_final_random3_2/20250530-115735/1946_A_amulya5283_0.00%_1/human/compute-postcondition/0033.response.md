Functionality: **This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It sorts each list of integers in ascending order, finds the median, and then increments the smallest element in the second half of the list until it is greater than the median. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of increments performed for each test case.**
