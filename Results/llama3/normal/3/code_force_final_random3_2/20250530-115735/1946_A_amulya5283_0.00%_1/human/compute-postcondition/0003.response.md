To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. The loop will execute if this condition is true.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `t` is at least 1
- `i` is 0
- `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is a positive integer
- `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order
- `median_index` is an integer
- `current_median` is a positive integer
- `heap` is a list of positive integers
- `operations` is 0

The variables in the loop head are `heap` and `current_median`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the relationship between `heap[0]` and `current_median`.

Since `heap` is a list of positive integers and `current_median` is a positive integer, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `heap[0]` is indeed less than or equal to `current_median`. However, given that both are positive integers and there's no specific constraint on their values relative to each other, we can't adjust their states further without additional context.

Therefore, the state remains as it is, with no additional constraints needed for the loop to execute at least once, given the information provided.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is a positive integer, `heap` is a list of positive integers, `operations` is 0**
