The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed**
