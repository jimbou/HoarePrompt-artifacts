According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `heap` and `current_median`. If `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, and `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one. For the loop to execute one more time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`, and `current_median` must be greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to current_median, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus two**
