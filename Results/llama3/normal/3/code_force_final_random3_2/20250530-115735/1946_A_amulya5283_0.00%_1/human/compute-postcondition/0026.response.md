Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to current_median, operations is 2, heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows: The first line removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The second line adds the value of `smallest + 1` back to the heap. The third line increments the value of `operations` by 1. The value of `t`, `i`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` remain unchanged. The heap now contains a new smallest element that is less than or equal to `current_median`, and the value of `operations` is incremented to 2.
