Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, operations is 2**

In this output state, the code has modified the heap and operations variables. The smallest element was removed from the heap, incremented by one, and then pushed back into the heap. The operations variable was incremented by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
