The variables in the loop head are heap and current_median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables heap and current_median. If heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median, and current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one. For the loop to execute one more time, heap[0] must be less than or equal to current_median, and current_median must be greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to current_median, operations is 1, heap[0] must be less than or equal to current_median**
