Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is greater than the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to current_median plus one, operations is 3, heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median plus one**

The code executes three lines. The first line removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The second line adds the value of `smallest + 1` back into the heap. The third line increments the value of `operations` by 1. 

The initial state of the heap has a smallest element that is less than or equal to `current_median`. After the first line, this smallest element is removed. The second line adds a new element that is one more than the previous smallest element, making the new smallest element less than or equal to `current_median + 1`. The third line increments `operations` from 2 to 3. 

All other variables remain unchanged.
