You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers.
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed for each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed for the last test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of times the loop executed for each test case in the list `test_cases`. Each test case in `test_cases` is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order. The list `results` contains the number of times the loop executed for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of times the loop executed for each test case in the list `test_cases`. Each test case in `test_cases` is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order. The list `results` contains the number of times the loop executed for each test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
