Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of times the loop executed for each test case in the list `test_cases`. Each test case in `test_cases` is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order. The list `results` contains the number of times the loop executed for each test case.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed for each test case. Each test case consists of a list of positive integers in ascending order, and the number of operations performed for each test case is stored in the `results` list.
