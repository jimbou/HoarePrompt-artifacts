Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus one**.

The code executes two operations on the heap: it removes the smallest element and then pushes the smallest element plus one back into the heap. This results in the smallest element being replaced by the smallest element plus one. The operations counter is incremented by one, reflecting the additional operation performed on the heap. All other variables remain unchanged.
