Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap is a list of positive integers, operations is 0**.

The code block assigns the first sublist of `test_cases` to `n` and `arr`, sorts `arr` in ascending order, calculates the median index and the current median, creates a heap from the second half of `arr`, and initializes `operations` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `test_cases`, and `results` remain unchanged.
