Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than current_median, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has terminated, and the heap now contains a new smallest element that is greater than the current median. The number of operations performed is equal to the number of times the loop executed. All other variables remain unchanged.
