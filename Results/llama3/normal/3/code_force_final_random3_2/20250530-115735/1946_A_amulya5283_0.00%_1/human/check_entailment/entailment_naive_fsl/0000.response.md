Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It sorts the input array and finds the median. Then, it uses a heap to keep track of the elements that need to be increased to make the median larger. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the input array has an odd or even number of elements, and when the median is already the largest element in the array.

The use of a heap is an efficient way to keep track of the elements that need to be increased, as it allows the program to easily find and remove the smallest element that needs to be increased.

The program also correctly handles the case when the input array has duplicate elements, as it uses the heap to keep track of the elements that need to be increased, regardless of their original value.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement.
