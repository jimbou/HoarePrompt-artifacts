Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap is a list of positive integers, operations is 0
Code of the loop:
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one, operations is 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, operations is 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, operations is 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
