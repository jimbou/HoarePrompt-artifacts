    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is `t-1`, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed for each test case, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed for the last test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of times the loop executed for each test case in the list `test_cases`. Each test case in `test_cases` is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order. The list `results` contains the number of times the loop executed for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It sorts each list of integers in ascending order, finds the median, and then increments the smallest element in the second half of the list until it is greater than the median. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of increments performed for each test case.
