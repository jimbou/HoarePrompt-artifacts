Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is a positive integer, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one, operations is 1**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The smallest element is removed from the heap and replaced by the smallest element plus one. This means that the heap now contains all the original elements except the smallest one, and the smallest element plus one is added to the heap.
*   The operations counter is incremented by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, and the values of the variables that are modified by the code are updated accordingly.
