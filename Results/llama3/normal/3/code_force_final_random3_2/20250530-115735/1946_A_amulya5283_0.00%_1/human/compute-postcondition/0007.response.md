According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `heap` and `current_median`. If `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is the smallest element plus one and `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one. Since `heap[0]` is the smallest element plus one, it is already greater than the smallest element, so `current_median` must be greater than the smallest element plus one for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, operations is 2**
