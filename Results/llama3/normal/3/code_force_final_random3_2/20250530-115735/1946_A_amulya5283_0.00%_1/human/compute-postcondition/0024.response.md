Output State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to current_median, operations is 1**

The code executes the following operations:

1.  `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)`: This line removes the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The heap now has one less element.
2.  `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`: This line adds a new element to the heap, which is the smallest element plus one. The heap now has the same number of elements as before, but with a new smallest element.
3.  `operations += 1`: This line increments the `operations` variable by one.

After executing these operations, the state of the variables is as follows:

*   `t` remains at least 3, as it is not modified by the code.
*   `i` remains 2, as it is not modified by the code.
*   `test_cases` remains a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, as it is not modified by the code.
*   `results` remains a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, as it is not modified by the code.
*   `n` remains a positive integer, as it is not modified by the code.
*   `arr` remains a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, as it is not modified by the code.
*   `median_index` remains an integer equal to `n // 2`, as it is not modified by the code.
*   `current_median` remains greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, as it is not modified by the code.
*   `heap` is now a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to `current_median`, as the smallest element was removed and replaced with a new element that is one more than the previous smallest element.
*   `operations` is now 1, as it was incremented by one.
