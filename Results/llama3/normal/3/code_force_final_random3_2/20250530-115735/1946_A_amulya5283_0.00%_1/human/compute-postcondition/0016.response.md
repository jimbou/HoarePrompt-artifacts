Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to current_median, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus two**

The code snippet modifies the `heap` and `operations` variables. The `heapq.heappop(heap)` function removes and returns the smallest element from the `heap` list, which is then stored in the `smallest` variable. The `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` function adds the `smallest + 1` value back into the `heap` list, effectively incrementing the smallest element by 1. The `operations += 1` statement increments the `operations` variable by 1. 

All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values. The `t`, `i`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median` variables are not affected by the code snippet.
