Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the value of `operations`, which is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
