Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is greater than the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the number of times the loop executed, which is stored in the variable `operations`. All other variables remain unchanged.
