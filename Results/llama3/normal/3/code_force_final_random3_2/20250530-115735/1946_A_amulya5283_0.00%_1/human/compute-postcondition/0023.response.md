To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to examine the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. This condition depends on the states of `heap` and `current_median`.

From the given state, we know:
- `heap` is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than `current_median`.
- `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one.

Given that `heap[0]` is the smallest element in `heap` and it is greater than `current_median`, and considering the condition for the loop to execute is `heap[0] <= current_median`, we need to adjust the state of `heap` or `current_median` so that this condition can be met.

However, the description already implies that `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median`, which contradicts the condition needed for the loop to execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state so that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Since we cannot change the fact that `heap[0]` is greater than `current_median` based on the given state, we need to reconsider the relationship between `heap[0]` and `current_median` to make the loop executable. The adjustment should ensure that the loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` can be true.
