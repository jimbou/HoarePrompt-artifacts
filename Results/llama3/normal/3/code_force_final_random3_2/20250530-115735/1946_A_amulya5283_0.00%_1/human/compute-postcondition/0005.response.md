The variables in the loop head are heap and current_median, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables heap and current_median. If heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, heap[0] is the smallest element plus one, and current_median is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, heap[0] must be less than or equal to current_median, so current_median must be greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one.
