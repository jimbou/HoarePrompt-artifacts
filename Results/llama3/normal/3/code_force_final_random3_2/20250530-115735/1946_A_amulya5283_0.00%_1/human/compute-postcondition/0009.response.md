Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being the value of the operations variable, which is now equal to the number of times the loop executed. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as the smallest element in the heap is less than or equal to the current median, and each iteration increments the operations variable by 1.
