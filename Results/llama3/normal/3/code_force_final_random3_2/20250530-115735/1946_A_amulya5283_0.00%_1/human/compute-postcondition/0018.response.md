Output State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to current_median plus one, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus three**

The code modifies the heap by removing its smallest element and adding a new element that is one more than the removed smallest element. This increases the smallest element in the heap by one. The operations counter is incremented by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
