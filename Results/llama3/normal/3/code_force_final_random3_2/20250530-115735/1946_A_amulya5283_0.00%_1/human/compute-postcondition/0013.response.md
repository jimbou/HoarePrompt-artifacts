To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the states of `heap[0]` and `current_median` so that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`.

According to the given state, `heap` is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap. This means the smallest element in the heap is currently the smallest element plus one. However, for the loop to execute, we need `heap[0]` (the smallest element) to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given that `current_median` is greater than the smallest element plus one, we need to adjust `current_median` to be greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, but not necessarily greater than the smallest element plus one.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is at least 2, i is 1, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed**
