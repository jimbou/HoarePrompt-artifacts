According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `heap[0]` and `current_median`. If `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, so no adjustment is needed for `heap[0]`. However, `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, which does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `current_median` is greater than the smallest element plus one.

State: **t is at least 3, i is 2, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer equal to n // 2, current_median is greater than the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is less than or equal to current_median, operations is 2, heap[0] is less than or equal to current_median**
