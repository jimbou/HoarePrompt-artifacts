Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, arr = test_cases[i]
    arr.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    current_median = arr[median_index]
    heap = arr[median_index:]
    heapq.heapify(heap)
    operations = 0
    while heap[0] <= current_median:
        smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
        heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is greater than the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer, `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list containing the number of times the loop executed plus the number of times the loop executed plus the current value of `operations`, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers in ascending order, `median_index` is an integer equal to `n // 2`, `current_median` is greater than or equal to the smallest element plus one, `heap` is a list of positive integers with a new smallest element that is greater than `current_median`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
