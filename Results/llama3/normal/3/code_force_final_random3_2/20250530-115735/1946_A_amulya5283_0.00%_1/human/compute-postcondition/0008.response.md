Output State: **t is at least 1, i is 0, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of n positive integers in ascending order, median_index is an integer, current_median is greater than the smallest element plus one, heap is a list of positive integers with the smallest element replaced by the smallest element plus one and then the smallest element plus one is pushed back into the heap, operations is 3**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

*   The smallest element is removed from the heap using `heapq.heappop(heap)`.
*   The removed smallest element is incremented by 1 and pushed back into the heap using `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`.
*   The number of operations is incremented by 1 using `operations += 1`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The final state includes the updated values of the affected variables, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
