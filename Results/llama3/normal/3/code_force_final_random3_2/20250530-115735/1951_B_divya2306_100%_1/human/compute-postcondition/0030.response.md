Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 4 and `n+2` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**

In this output state, the value of `win_with_swap` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `i` has also been updated to `win_with_swap + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program continues to check if `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, and if so, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, it continues execution.
