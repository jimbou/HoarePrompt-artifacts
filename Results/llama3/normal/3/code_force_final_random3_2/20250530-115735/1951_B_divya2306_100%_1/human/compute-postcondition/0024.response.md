Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `k - 1` is greater than `win_with_swap`, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 1 and `n+1` inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is equal to `win_with_swap`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The list `a` still contains unique integers, and the relationship between `k`, `win_with_swap`, and `n` remains the same. The value of `i` is still equal to `win_with_swap`, and the current value of `a[i]` is still greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`.
