To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `win_with_swap`, `k - 1` is greater than `win_with_swap`, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `win_with_swap + 1`. Since `i` is now greater than `win_with_swap`, `win_with_swap` must be incremented by 1 as well, so `win_with_swap` becomes `win_with_swap + 1`. The value of `k` remains the same.

The other variables, `n`, `a`, `wins`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 3 and `n+1` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1**
