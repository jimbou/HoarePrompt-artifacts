Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 1 and `n+1` inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `n`. The number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` is less than `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    win_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `k - 1` is greater than `win_with_swap`, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 2 and `n+1` inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 4 and `n+2` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is `win_with_swap + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 5 and `n+3` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
