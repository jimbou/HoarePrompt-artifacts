Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 1 and `n+1` inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `n`. The number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` is less than `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `win_with_swap` is increased by 1 compared to `wins`, and all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1. The list `a` still contains `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` is still less than `k`.
