Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 4 and `n+2` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `win_with_swap`, `a`, `wins`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
