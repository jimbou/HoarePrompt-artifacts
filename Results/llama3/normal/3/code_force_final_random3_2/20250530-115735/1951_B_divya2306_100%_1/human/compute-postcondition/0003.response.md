Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `a[i]` is still greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
