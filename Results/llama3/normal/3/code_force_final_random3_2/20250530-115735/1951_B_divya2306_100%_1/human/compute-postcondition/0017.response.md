The code prints the value of `wins` minus 1.
Since `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive and its current value is greater than or equal to `k`, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `wins` without knowing the value of `n` and `k`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `wins` minus 1.
Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is between 0 and n inclusive and is greater than or equal to k)**
