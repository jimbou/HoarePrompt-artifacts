The code is a simple break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables do not change. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
