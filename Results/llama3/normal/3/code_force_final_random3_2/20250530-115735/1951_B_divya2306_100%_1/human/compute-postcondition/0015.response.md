Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is `n`.

The loop will execute until it has iterated over all elements in the list `a` or until it finds an element that is greater than `a[k - 1]`. At this point, the loop will break, and the value of `wins` will be the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. The value of `i` will be `n` because the loop iterates `n` times.
