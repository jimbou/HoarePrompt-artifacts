The code prints the maximum value between two expressions: `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

`wins` is a variable that represents the number of wins, which is between 0 and `n` inclusive. `win_with_swap` is a variable that represents the number of wins with a swap, which is between `k` and `n+1` inclusive.

The expression `wins - 1` simply subtracts 1 from the number of wins.

The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is a bit more complex. It subtracts the number of wins from the number of wins with a swap, then subtracts 1, and finally adds 1 if the number of wins is not 0.

Since `wins` and `win_with_swap` are both integers, the result of the subtraction and addition operations will also be integers.

Therefore, the code will print the maximum value between two integers: `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.

Output: **the maximum value between wins - 1 and win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)**
