The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
