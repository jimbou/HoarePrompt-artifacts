Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `k - 1` is greater than `win_with_swap`, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 1 and `n+1` inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is equal to `win_with_swap`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`.**
