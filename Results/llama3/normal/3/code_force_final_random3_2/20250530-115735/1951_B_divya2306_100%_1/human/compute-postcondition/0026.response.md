Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive and `k - 1` is greater than `win_with_swap`, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 2 and `n+1` inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `win_with_swap` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and constraints on the variables are still valid, with the updated value of `win_with_swap` being between 2 and `n+1` inclusive.
