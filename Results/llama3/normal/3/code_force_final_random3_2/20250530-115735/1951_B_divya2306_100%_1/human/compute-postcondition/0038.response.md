Functionality: **This function determines the maximum number of wins that can be achieved in a game where a player can either win or lose. The game consists of multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of elements in the game and k is the target number of wins. The second line contains n unique integers representing the elements in the game. The function calculates the number of wins that can be achieved without swapping any elements and the number of wins that can be achieved with a single swap. It then prints the maximum of these two values. If the number of wins without swapping is greater than or equal to k, the function prints wins - 1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of wins that can be achieved with a swap and prints the maximum of wins - 1 and the number of wins with a swap minus the number of wins without a swap plus 1, if wins is not zero.**
