Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `win_with_swap` is between 4 and `n+2` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
