Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` unique integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `wins` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the value of `wins` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]` still holds, and if it is true, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no change occurs.
