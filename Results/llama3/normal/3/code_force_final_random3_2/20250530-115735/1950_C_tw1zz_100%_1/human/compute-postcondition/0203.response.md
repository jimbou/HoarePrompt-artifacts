Output State: **h is a string representing the hours from the input time, m1 is the minutes from the input time, m is the minutes from the input time, stdin is empty, _ is t. If h is '01', then h1 is '01' and time is 'AM'. If h is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', then h1 is the same as h and time is 'AM' if h is '12' then time is 'PM'. If h is '00', then h1 is '12' and time is 'AM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively and time is 'PM'. The time in 12-hour format is printed, where the hour is represented by h1, the minutes are represented by m, and the time of day is represented by time.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has processed all the input times and printed them in 12-hour format. The variables h, m1, and m retain their values from the last iteration, and stdin is empty because all input lines have been processed. The variable _ is equal to t, indicating that the loop has executed t times. The values of h1 and time are determined based on the value of h, following the same rules as in the previous output states.
