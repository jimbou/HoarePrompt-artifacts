Postcondition: **h is a string representing the hours from the input time, m1 is the minutes from the input time, m is the minutes from the input time, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format, _ is t-1. If h is '05', then h1 is '05' and time is 'AM'. If h is '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', then h1 is '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11' respectively and time is 'AM'. If h is '12', then h1 is '12' and time is 'PM'. If h is '00', then h1 is '12' and time is 'AM'. If h is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', then h1 is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' respectively and time is 'PM'. For all other values of h, the values of h1 and time are not updated.**
