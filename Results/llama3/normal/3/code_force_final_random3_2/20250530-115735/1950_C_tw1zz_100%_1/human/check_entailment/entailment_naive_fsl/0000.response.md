Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts 24-hour time to 12-hour time. It handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the hour is 00, 12, or greater than 12. The program uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the correct hour and AM/PM designation for the 12-hour time.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible inputs. For example, it correctly converts 09:41 to 09:41 AM, 18:06 to 06:06 PM, and 00:59 to 12:59 AM.

The program's use of if-elif statements may seem verbose, but it is a straightforward and easy-to-understand approach. The program does not use any unnecessary variables or complex logic, making it easy to follow and verify.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
