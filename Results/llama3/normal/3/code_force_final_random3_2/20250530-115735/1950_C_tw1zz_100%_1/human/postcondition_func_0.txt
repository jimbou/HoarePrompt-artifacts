Converts 24-hour time to 12-hour time and prints the result. The function takes no parameters and returns no value. It reads a number of test cases from standard input, then for each test case, it reads a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm), converts it to 12-hour format, and prints the result. The conversion is done by adjusting the hour and adding 'AM' or 'PM' based on the original hour. The function consumes all input and leaves the standard input empty.
