Output State: **h is '15', m1 is the minutes from the input time, m is the minutes from the input time, time is 'PM', h1 is '03'**

The code snippet assigns the value '03' to the variable h1 and the value 'PM' to the variable time. The initial values of h, m1, and m remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of h is still '15', which is not equal to the specified values. The input time and its minutes (m1 and m) are also unaffected. The variable time now holds the value 'PM', and a new variable h1 is introduced with the value '03'.
