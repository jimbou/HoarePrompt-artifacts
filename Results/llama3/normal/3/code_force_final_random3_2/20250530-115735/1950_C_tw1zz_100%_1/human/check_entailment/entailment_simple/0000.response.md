Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly converts the input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The program handles all possible cases for the hours, including the special cases for 12 PM and 12 AM. It also correctly determines whether the time is AM or PM based on the hour.

The program uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and whether the time is AM or PM. This approach is straightforward and easy to understand.

The program also correctly prints the time in 12-hour format, including the hour, minutes, and AM/PM indicator.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
