Output State: **h is '16', m1 is the minutes from the input time, m is the minutes from the input time, time is 'PM', h1 is '04'.**

The code assigns the value '04' to h1 and 'PM' to time. The values of h, m1, and m remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of h is still '16', and the values of m1 and m remain the minutes from the input time. The value of time is now 'PM', and the value of h1 is '04'.
