The code prints the time in 12-hour format, where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format, m is the minutes, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM'. The values of h1 and time are determined based on the value of h, which is the hour in 24-hour format.

Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where h1 is the hour in 12-hour format, m is the minutes, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM', based on the value of h)**
