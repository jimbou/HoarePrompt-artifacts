The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains a valid input: the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1440), and each of the next t lines contains a string s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. So for the loop to be executed, the input must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains a valid input: the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 1440), and each of the next t lines contains a string s of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format, `_` is 0**
