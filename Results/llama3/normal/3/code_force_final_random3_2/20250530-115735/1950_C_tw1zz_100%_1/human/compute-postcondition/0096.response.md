Postcondition: ***h is a string, m1 is the minutes from the input time, m is the minutes from the input time, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format. If h is '01', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '01'. If h is '02', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '02'. If h is '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', then time is 'AM' and h1 is the same as h. If h is '12', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '12'. If h is '13' to '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format (01 to 11). If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'.***
