The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of lines in the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is t-1, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format. So for the loop to be executed one more time _ must be t and stdin must contain t lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format.
State: **h is a string representing the hours from the input time, m1 is the minutes from the input time, m is the minutes from the input time, stdin contains t lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format, _ is t**
