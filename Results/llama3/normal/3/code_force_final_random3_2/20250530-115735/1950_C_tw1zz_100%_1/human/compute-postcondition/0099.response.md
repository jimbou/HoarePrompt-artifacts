The only objects in the loop head are variable _ and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If the stdin contains at least t lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format the loop executes again for the t-th time. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain t lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format and the variable _ is t-1.
State: **`h` is a string, `m1` is the minutes from the input time, `m` is the minutes from the input time, stdin contains t lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format, _ is t-1**
