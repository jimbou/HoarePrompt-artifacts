Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly converts 24-hour time to 12-hour time and prints the result. The program handles all possible cases for the hour in 24-hour format, from '00' to '23', and correctly adjusts the hour and adds 'AM' or 'PM' based on the original hour. The program also handles the case where the hour is '12' and correctly prints '12' instead of '00' for both AM and PM.

Correctness: **True**
