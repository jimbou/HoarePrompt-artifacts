Output State: **h is '21', h1 is '09', time is 'PM', m1 is the minutes from the input time, m is the minutes from the input time, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format, and h is not equal to '01', h is not equal to '02', h is not equal to '03', h is not equal to '04', h is not equal to '05', h is not equal to '06', h is not equal to '07', h is not equal to '08', h is not equal to '09', h is not equal to '10', h is not equal to '11', h is not equal to '12', h is not equal to '13', h is not equal to '14', h is not equal to '15', h is not equal to '16', h is not equal to '17', h is not equal to '18', h is not equal to '19', and h is not equal to '20'.**

The code assigns the value '09' to the variable h1 and the value 'PM' to the variable time. The initial value of h remains unchanged as '21'. The values of m1 and m, which represent the minutes from the input time, are not affected by the code. The state of stdin also remains unchanged, containing t-1 lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format. The conditions stating that h is not equal to various values from '01' to '20' are still valid, as the value of h is '21'.
