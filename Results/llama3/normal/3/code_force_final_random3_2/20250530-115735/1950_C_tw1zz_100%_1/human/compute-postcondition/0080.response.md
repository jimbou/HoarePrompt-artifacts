Postcondition: **h is a string, m1 is the minutes from the input time, m is the minutes from the input time, time is a string, stdin contains t-1 lines of strings representing valid times in the 24-hour format. If h is '17', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '05'. If h is '18', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '06'. If h is '19', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '07'. If h is '20', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '08'. If h is '21', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '09'. If h is '22', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '10'. If h is '23', then time is 'PM' and h1 is '11'. If h is '00', then time is 'AM' and h1 is '12'. Otherwise, the values of h, m1, m, time, and stdin remain unchanged.**
