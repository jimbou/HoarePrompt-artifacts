Based on the precondition, the `print(result)` statement will print the first result in the `results` list.

Since `results` is a list containing at least 1 result of `func_1(n, a)`, the first result in the `results` list is the output of the function `func_1(n, a)`.

The function `func_1(n, a)` takes two arguments: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[idx]`, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= `n` for all `i`, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`.

Since the exact values of `data`, `idx`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n` and the output of `func_1(n, a)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first result of `func_1(n, a)`.

Output: **the first result of func_1(n, a) (where n is the value at data[idx] and a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n)**
