Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the sum of all n values, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n, data is a list of strings, t is 0, results is a list containing all results of func_1(n, a), stdin is empty, and the last result of func_1(n, a) which is result is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `idx`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `stdin` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `results` list now contains all the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration of the loop. The last result of `func_1(n, a)` is being printed, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
