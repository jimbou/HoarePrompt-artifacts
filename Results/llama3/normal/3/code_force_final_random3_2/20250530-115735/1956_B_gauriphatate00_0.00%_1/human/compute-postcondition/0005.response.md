To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at data[idx], `idx` is equal to its original value plus 2n + 1, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) and the result of func_1(n, a) where n is the new value and a is the new list of integers, `stdin` is empty**
