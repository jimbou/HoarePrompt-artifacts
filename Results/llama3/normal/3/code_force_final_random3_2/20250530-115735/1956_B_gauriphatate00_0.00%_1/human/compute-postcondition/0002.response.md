Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus n + 1, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n, data is a list of strings, t is at least 1, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a), stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value at `data[idx]`. The value of `idx` has been incremented by `n + 1` due to the two increment operations. The list `a` now contains `n` integers, each between 1 and `n` (inclusive), as it has been reassigned to the list of integers parsed from `data[idx:idx + n]`. The list `results` now contains the result of the function call `func_1(n, a)`. The other variables, `data`, `t`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
