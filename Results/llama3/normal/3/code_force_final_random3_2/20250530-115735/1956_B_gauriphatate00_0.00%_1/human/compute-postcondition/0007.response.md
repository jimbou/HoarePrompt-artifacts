Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus the sum of all n values, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n, data is a list of strings, t is 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) for each iteration, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` will be the last value read from the `data` list, `idx` will be incremented by the sum of all `n` values read during the iterations, `a` will be the last list of integers read from the `data` list, `data` remains unchanged, `t` will be 0 since the loop has finished, `results` will contain the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, and `stdin` remains empty.
