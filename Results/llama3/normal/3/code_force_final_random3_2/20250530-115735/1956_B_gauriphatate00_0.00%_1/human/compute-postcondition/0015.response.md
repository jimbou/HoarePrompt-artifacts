The code prints the third result of the function `func_1(n, a)`, where `n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[idx]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `n` values, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= `n` for all `i`, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`. Since the exact values of `n`, `idx`, `data`, and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the third result of `func_1(n, a)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third result of the function `func_1(n, a)`.

Output: **the third result of func_1(n, a) (where n is the value at data[idx] and a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n)**
