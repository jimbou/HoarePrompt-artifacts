To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `result` and the list `results`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 result, the loop executes. Since `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, we need to ensure that `results` has at least 1 element.

Additionally, since `result` is the loop variable, we need to set its initial value to the first element of the `results` list.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[idx]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `n` values, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= `n` for all `i`, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 1 result of `func_1(n, a)`, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the first result in the `results` list**
