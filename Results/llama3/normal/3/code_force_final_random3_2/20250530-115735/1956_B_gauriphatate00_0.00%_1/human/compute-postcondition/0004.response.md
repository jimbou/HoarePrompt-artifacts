Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus 2n + 1, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n, data is a list of strings, t is at least 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) and the result of func_1(n, a) where n is the new value and a is the new list of integers, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value at the index `idx` in the `data` list. The index `idx` is incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the `data` list. The list `a` is updated to contain `n` integers, each between 1 and `n` (inclusive), which are extracted from the `data` list starting from the current index `idx`. The index `idx` is further incremented by `n` to point to the next element after the extracted integers. The `results` list is appended with the result of calling the function `func_1` with the new values of `n` and `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the `stdin` remains empty.
