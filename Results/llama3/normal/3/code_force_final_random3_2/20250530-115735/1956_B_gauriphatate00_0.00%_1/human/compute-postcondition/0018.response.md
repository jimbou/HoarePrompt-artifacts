Functionality: **Reads input from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results of a function (func_1) applied to each batch. The input is expected to be a series of integers, where the first integer in each batch specifies the size of the batch, and the remaining integers in the batch are processed by func_1. The function reads all input, processes it, and prints all results before terminating.**
