Output State: **n is an integer equal to the value at data[idx], idx is equal to its original value plus 2n + 1 + n, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n, data is a list of strings, t is greater than 0, results is a list containing the result of func_1(n, a) and the result of func_1(n, a) where n is the new value and a is the new list of integers, stdin is empty**

The code block updates the values of `n`, `idx`, `a`, and `results`. The first line assigns the integer value at `data[idx]` to `n`. The second line increments `idx` by 1. The third line assigns a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]` to `a`, where the length of `a` is equal to `n`. The fourth line increments `idx` by `n`. The fifth line appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to `results`. The values of `t` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
