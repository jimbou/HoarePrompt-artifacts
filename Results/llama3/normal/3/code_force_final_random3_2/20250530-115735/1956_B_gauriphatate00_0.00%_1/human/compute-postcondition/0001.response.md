To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` because it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (not used in the loop body), we don't need to adjust its state.

State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n for all i, and the length of a is equal to n, data is a list of strings, idx is 1, t is at least 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**
