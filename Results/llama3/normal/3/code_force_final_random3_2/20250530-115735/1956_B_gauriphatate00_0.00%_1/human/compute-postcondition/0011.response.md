To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for result in results:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `result` and `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` is the first result in the `results` list, and it is being printed. For the loop to execute again, `result` needs to be the next result in the `results` list.

Since `results` is a list containing at least 1 result, we can assume that it has at least 2 results. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `result` to be the second result in the `results` list.

The state of `results` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop iteration.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[idx]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `n` values, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= `n` for all `i`, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results of `func_1(n, a)`, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the second result in the `results` list**
