Output: **`n` is an integer equal to the value at `data[idx]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus the sum of all `n` values, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= `n` for all `i`, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results of `func_1(n, a)`, `stdin` is empty, `result` is the second result in the `results` list, and the second result of `func_1(n, a)` which is `result` is being printed**
