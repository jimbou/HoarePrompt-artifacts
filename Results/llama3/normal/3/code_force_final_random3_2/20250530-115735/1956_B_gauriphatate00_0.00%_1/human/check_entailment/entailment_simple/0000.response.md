Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem asks to find the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally in a card game. The game is played with a deck of 2n cards, where each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each integer appears exactly twice. The cards are distributed between you and Nene, and you take turns placing cards on the table. You receive a point if there is already a card with the same integer on the table.

The program uses a Counter to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand. It then calculates the number of pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand. The maximum number of points you can get is the minimum of the number of pairs and half of the total number of cards you have (n // 2). This is because you can only place one card from each pair on the table to get a point, and you can only place at most half of your cards on the table.

The program correctly implements this logic and returns the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
