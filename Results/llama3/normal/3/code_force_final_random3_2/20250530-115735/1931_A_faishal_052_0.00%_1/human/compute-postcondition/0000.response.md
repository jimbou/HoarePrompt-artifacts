The code `cases = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 100) and then t integers (3 <= n <= 78). The first input is assigned to `cases`, so `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains one input: t integers (3 <= n <= 78).

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains one input: t integers (3 <= n <= 78)**
