Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 2, arr has one more element than before, lex is one less than its original value**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables as follows:

* The first line appends the value 1 to the end of the list `arr`, increasing its length by 1.
* The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1, making it one less than its original value.

The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The final state includes all the information from the initial state, with the updated values of `arr` and `lex` after the code execution.
