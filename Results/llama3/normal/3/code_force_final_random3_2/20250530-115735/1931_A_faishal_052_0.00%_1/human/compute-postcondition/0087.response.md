Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 1, arr is [1, 26] or [26, 26], k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, range is 2, and lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26.**

The code first appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. If `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, then `arr` becomes [1, 26]. Otherwise, if `lex` is an integer larger than 26, then `arr` becomes [26, 26]. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, resulting in a new value for `lex` that is 26 less than its original value. No other variables are affected by the code.
