The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since `k` is at least 0 and less than 3, it can be 0, 1, or 2.

If `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, then `arr` is either `[1, lex], [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, 1, lex], or [26, 1, 1, lex] or [26, 26, 1, lex]`. In this case, `arr[k]` can be 1, lex, or 26.

If `lex` is an integer larger than 26 but less than 52, then `arr` is `[1, 26, lex] or [26, 1, lex]`. In this case, `arr[k]` can be 1, 26, or lex.

If `lex` is an integer larger than or equal to 52, then `arr` is `[1, 26, 26, lex] or [26, 1, 26, lex] or [26, 26, 26, lex] or [26, 26, 1, 26, lex] or [26, 1, 26, 26, lex] or [1, 26, 26, 26, lex]`. In this case, `arr[k]` can be 1, 26, or lex.

Since `k` is at least 0 and less than 3, `arr[k]` can be the first, second, or third element of `arr`. 

The ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` will be between 97 and 122 (inclusive), which corresponds to the lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'. 

Therefore, the code will print a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive), depending on the value of `arr[k]`.

Output: **a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (inclusive)**
