Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 2, stdin is empty, arr contains three elements, and lex is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26.**

The code adds the value of `lex` to the `arr` list and then sorts the list in ascending order. The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` initially contains two elements: 1 and `lex-2`. If `lex` is more than 26 but less than 52, `arr` initially contains two elements: 26 and `lex-52`. If `lex` is 52 or more, `arr` initially contains two elements: 26 and `lex-52`. After the code executes, `arr` will contain three elements: the original elements and the new element `lex`, which is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26. The other variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
