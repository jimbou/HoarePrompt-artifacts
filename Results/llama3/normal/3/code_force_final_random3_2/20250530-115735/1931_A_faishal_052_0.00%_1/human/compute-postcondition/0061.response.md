Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 0, stdin is empty. If lex was originally less than or equal to 26, arr contains 1 and 1, and lex is reduced by 2. If lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, then arr contains 26 and 26, and lex is less than or equal to 0. If lex was originally more than 52, then arr contains 26 and 26, and lex is less than or equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

* The value of `cases` remains at least 2.
* The value of `i` remains 1.
* The value of `j` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
* The `stdin` remains empty.
* If the original value of `lex` was less than or equal to 26, the array `arr` contains two elements, both 1, and the value of `lex` is reduced by 2.
* If the original value of `lex` was less than 52 but more than 26, the array `arr` contains two elements, both 26, and the value of `lex` is less than or equal to 0.
* If the original value of `lex` was more than 52, the array `arr` contains two elements, both 26, and the value of `lex` is less than or equal to 0.
