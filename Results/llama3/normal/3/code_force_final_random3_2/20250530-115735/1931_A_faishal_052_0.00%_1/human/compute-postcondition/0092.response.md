Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, range is 2, lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1, and arr is either [1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 1, 1] or [26, 26, 1].**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, and the list `arr` has been appended with an additional element, 1. The other variables, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `range`, remain unchanged. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are still being printed.
