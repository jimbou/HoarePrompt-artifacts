To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is at least 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `stdin` is empty.
   - `arr` contains three elements.
   - `lex` is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26.
   - `k` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The code prints a character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`.
   - Since `k` is 0, we are interested in the first element of `arr`.
   - The `chr()` function in Python returns the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer.
   - Adding 96 to the value of `arr[k]` and then converting it to a character using `chr()` implies that we are dealing with a value that, when increased by 96, falls within the range of lowercase letters in the ASCII table (97-122).

4. **Output:**
   - Given that `arr` contains three elements and `k` is 0, we are looking at the first element of `arr`.
   - However, the exact value of the first element of `arr` is not provided in the initial state.
   - Therefore, we cannot compute the exact character that will be printed without knowing the value of the first element of `arr`.
   - Nonetheless, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **a lowercase letter (where the specific letter depends on the value of the first element of the list arr plus 96)**
