Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 1, stdin is empty, arr contains either 1 or 26, and lex is less than or equal to 26.**

The code snippet modifies the state of `arr` and `lex`. The first line appends 26 to the list `arr`, and the second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. Since `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, the subtraction operation will result in a value less than or equal to 26. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
