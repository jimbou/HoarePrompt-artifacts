Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, j is 2. If lex is less than or equal to 26, arr contains two elements which are 1 and lex is two less than its original value. If lex is more than 26 but less than 52, arr contains two elements which are 26 and lex is reduced by 52. If lex is 52 or more, arr has two additional elements 26 and lex is reduced by 52.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute twice, and after each iteration, the value of j will increment by 1. If the initial value of lex is less than or equal to 26, the loop will append 1 to the array arr twice, and lex will be reduced by 2. If the initial value of lex is more than 26 but less than 52, the loop will append 26 to the array arr twice, and lex will be reduced by 52. If the initial value of lex is 52 or more, the loop will append 26 to the array arr twice, and lex will be reduced by 52. The values of cases, i, and stdin remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
