Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, range is 2, lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 26, and arr is [1, 26] or [26, 1] or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 1, 26] or [26, 26, 26].**

In this output state, the values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `range` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are still being printed. The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, and the list `arr` has an additional element of 26 appended to it. The possible values of `arr` depend on the original value of `lex` and can be one of the four combinations: [1, 26], [26, 1], [1, 26, 26], [26, 1, 26], or [26, 26, 26].
