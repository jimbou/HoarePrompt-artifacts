Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 2, arr is a list, stdin is empty, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and range is 2. If lex is an integer less than or equal to 26, then lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and arr is either [1], [1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 1, 1] or [26, 26, 1]. If lex is an integer larger than 26 but less than 52, then lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and arr is [1, 26] or [26, 1]. If lex is an integer larger than or equal to 52, then lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and arr is [1, 26] or [26, 1] or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 1, 26] or [26, 26, 26] with an additional element 26 appended to it.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop has iterated over the range of 2, and the value of `j` has reached 2. The list `arr` has been populated with elements based on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains a combination of 1s and 26s. If `lex` is between 26 and 52, `arr` contains either [1, 26] or [26, 1]. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` contains a combination of 1s and 26s, with an additional 26 appended to the end.
