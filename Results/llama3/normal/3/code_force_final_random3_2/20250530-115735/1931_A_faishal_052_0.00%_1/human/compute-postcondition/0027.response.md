To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `k` and the range `3`.

Since the loop will execute as long as the range has at least one element, we can adjust the state of `k` to be the first element in the range, which is `0`. The range `3` is already defined, so we don't need to adjust it.

The other states, such as `cases`, `i`, `j`, `stdin`, `arr`, and `lex`, are not relevant to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `arr` contains three elements, `lex` is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26, `k` is 0**
