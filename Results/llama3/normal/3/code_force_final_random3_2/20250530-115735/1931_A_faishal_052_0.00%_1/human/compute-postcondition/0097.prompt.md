Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 0, arr is an empty list, stdin is empty, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, lex is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 0, arr is a list, stdin is empty, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and range is 2. If lex is an integer less than or equal to 26, then lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and arr is [1]. Otherwise, lex is an integer larger than 26 and arr is [26].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and `range` is 2. If `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, then `lex` is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and `arr` is [1]. If `lex` is an integer larger than 26 but less than 52, then `lex` is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 1]. If `lex` is an integer larger than or equal to 52, then `lex` is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 26].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and range is 2. If lex is an integer less than or equal to 26, then lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and arr is either [1], [1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 1, 1] or [26, 26, 1]. If lex is an integer larger than 26 but less than 52, then lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and arr is [1, 26] or [26, 1]. If lex is an integer larger than or equal to 52, then lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and arr is [1, 26] or [26, 1] or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 1, 26] or [26, 26, 26] with an additional element 26 appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
