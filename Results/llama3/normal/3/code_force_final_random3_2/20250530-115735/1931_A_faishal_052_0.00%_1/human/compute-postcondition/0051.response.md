Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 1, arr contains either 1 and 26 or 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27 or is less than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not modify it. The values of `i` and `j` also remain the same, as they are not affected by the code. The value of `lex` is reduced by 26 due to the second line of the code, and its final value depends on its original value. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, it becomes less than or equal to 0. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, it is reduced by 26. The value of `arr` is modified by the first line of the code, which appends 26 to the list. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains 1 and 26. If `lex` was originally greater than 26, `arr` contains 26 and 26.
