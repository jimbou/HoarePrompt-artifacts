Postcondition: ***cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2. If lex was originally less than or equal to 26, then arr contains 1 and 1, and lex is reduced by 1 from its original value. If lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, then arr contains either 1 and 26 or 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27 or is less than or equal to 0. If lex was originally more than 52, then arr contains either 1 or 26, and lex is less than or equal to 26. After the if else block, cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2, arr contains either 1, 1, and 26, 1, 26, and 26, or 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27, less than or equal to 0, or less than or equal to 26.***
