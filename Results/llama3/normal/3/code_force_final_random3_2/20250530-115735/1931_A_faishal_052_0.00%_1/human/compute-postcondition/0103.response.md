The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`, where `k` is 1. Since `arr` is a sorted list that includes the original elements of `arr` and `lex`, and `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, then `lex` is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and `arr` is either [1, lex], [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, 1, lex], or [26, 1, 1, lex] or [26, 26, 1, lex]. 

Since `k` is 1, `arr[k]` will be the second element of the list `arr`. If `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, then `arr[k]` will be `lex`. Since `lex` is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1, `arr[k]` will be an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1.

The character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` will be the character represented by the ASCII value of `lex + 96 - 1 + 96` or `lex + 191`. Since `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, `lex + 191` will be an ASCII value between 192 and 217.

Output: **the character represented by the ASCII value of lex + 191 (where lex is an integer less than or equal to 26)**
