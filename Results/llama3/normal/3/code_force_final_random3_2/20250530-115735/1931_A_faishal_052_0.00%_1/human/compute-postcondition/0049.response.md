According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.
State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `stdin` is empty. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains 1 and `lex` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` is less than or equal to 26**
