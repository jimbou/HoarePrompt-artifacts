Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 0, stdin is empty, arr is [26], lex is 26**

The code first appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making it `[26]`. Then, it subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. Since `lex` was 52 or more, it was reduced by 52 in the initial state, making it 52 - 52 = 0, but then it was increased by 26, making it 26. After subtracting 26, `lex` becomes 0. No other variables are affected.
