According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range `2`. If the range is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 0, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we only need to adjust the state of `j` to be 0 and the range to be 2.

State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 0, arr is an empty list, stdin is empty, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, lex is an integer, range is 2**
