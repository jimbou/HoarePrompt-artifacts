State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 2, k is 1, range is 2, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, stdin is empty, and arr is a sorted list that includes the original elements of arr and lex. If lex is an integer less than or equal to 26, then lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and arr is either [1, lex], [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, 1, lex], or [26, 1, 1, lex] or [26, 26, 1, lex]. If lex is an integer larger than 26 but less than 52, then lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and arr is [1, 26, lex] or [26, 1, lex]. If lex is an integer larger than or equal to 52, then lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and arr is [1, 26, 26, lex] or [26, 1, 26, lex] or [26, 26, 26, lex] or [26, 26, 1, 26, lex] or [26, 1, 26, 26, lex] or [1, 26, 26, 26, lex], and the character represented by the ASCII value of arr[k] + 96 is being printed**
