Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 0, arr is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(3):
    print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, `stdin` is empty, `k` is 0, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is being printed, where `arr[k]` is the first element of the sorted list `arr` and `k` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, `stdin` is empty, `k` is 2, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is being printed, where `arr[k]` is the second element of the sorted list `arr` and `k` is 2, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[2] + 96` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, `stdin` is empty, `k` is 3, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k]` (which is the third element of the list `arr`) plus 96 is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
