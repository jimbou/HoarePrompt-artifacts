The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, making it a list containing a single element, 1. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1.

Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, arr is [1], lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is less than or equal to 25, j is 0**
