The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. If `i` is less than `cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `cases` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `cases` must be greater than 1.
State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `arr` contains three elements, `lex` is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26, and the ASCII characters represented by the values of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` plus 96 have been printed.**
