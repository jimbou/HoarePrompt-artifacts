Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 0, arr is [26], stdin is empty, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, lex is an integer larger than 26 and larger than or equal to 26, range is 2**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, which was initially empty. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, which was initially an integer larger than 26 and larger than or equal to 52. After the subtraction, `lex` becomes an integer larger than 26 and larger than or equal to 26. The other variables, `cases`, `i`, `j`, `stdin`, `k`, and `range`, are not affected by the code block and retain their initial values.
