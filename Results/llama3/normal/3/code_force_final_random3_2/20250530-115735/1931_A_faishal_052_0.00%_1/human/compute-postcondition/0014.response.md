Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 1, arr contains at least one element which is 1, lex is one less than its original value.**

The code first appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, so `arr` now contains at least one element which is 1. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1, so `lex` is now one less than its original value. The variables `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code and retain their original values.
