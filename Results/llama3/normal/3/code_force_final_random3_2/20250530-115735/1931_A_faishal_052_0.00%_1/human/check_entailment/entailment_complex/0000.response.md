Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases from the input and iterates over each case.
2. For each case, it reads the encoded word (an integer) and initializes an empty list `arr`.
3. The program then enters a loop that runs twice. In each iteration, it checks the value of `lex` (the encoded word) and appends a value to `arr` based on its magnitude. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 52 (exclusive), it appends 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, it appends 26 again. This is a correct way to decompose the encoded word into its constituent parts.
4. After the loop, the program appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
5. The program then sorts `arr` in ascending order.
6. Finally, the program prints the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the elements in `arr`, shifted by 96 (since the ASCII value of 'a' is 97). This is a correct way to convert the decomposed parts back into a string.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
