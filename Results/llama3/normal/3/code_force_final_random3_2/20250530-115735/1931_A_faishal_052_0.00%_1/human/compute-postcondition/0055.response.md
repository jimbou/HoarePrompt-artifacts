The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j. If j is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 1. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1, so j is 2. However, since j must be less than 2 for the loop to execute again, the loop will not execute again if j is 2. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2, stdin is empty. If lex was originally less than or equal to 26, then arr contains 1 and 1, and lex is reduced by 1 from its original value. If lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, then arr contains either 1 and 26 or 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27 or is less than or equal to 0. If lex was originally more than 52, then arr contains either 1 or 26, and lex is less than or equal to 26.**
