Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 0, stdin is empty, arr is [26], lex is less than 26**

The code first appends the value 26 to the array `arr`, making it `[26]`. Then, it subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`. Since the initial value of `lex` was more than 26 but less than 52, subtracting 26 will result in a value less than 26. The other variables, `cases`, `i`, and `j`, are not affected by the code.
