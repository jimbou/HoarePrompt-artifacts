Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2, arr contains 1 and 1 and 1, or 1 and 26 and 1, or 26 and 26 and 1, or 1 and 1, or 26 and 1, and lex is reduced by 1 from its original value.**

In this output state, the value of cases remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of i and j also remain the same as they are not modified by the code. The arr list is appended with a new value of 1, so its contents depend on the original value of lex. If lex was originally less than or equal to 26, arr contains 1 and 1 and 1. If lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, arr contains either 1 and 26 and 1, or 26 and 26 and 1. If lex was originally more than 52, arr contains either 1 and 1, or 26 and 1. The value of lex is reduced by 1 from its original value.
