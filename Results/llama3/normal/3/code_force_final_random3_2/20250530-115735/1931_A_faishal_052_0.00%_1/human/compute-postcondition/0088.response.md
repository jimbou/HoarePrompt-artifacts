Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 1, arr is [1, 26] or [26, 26], k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, range is 2, and lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26.**

The code block modifies the `arr` list and the `lex` variable. The first line appends the value 26 to the `arr` list. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the `arr` list will be either [1, 26] or [26, 26]. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, resulting in a new value for `lex` that is 26 less than its original value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
