The only variable in the loop head is `j` and the range `2`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range `2`. If the range is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is 2, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0. The range `2` is already at least 1, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 0, stdin is empty, arr is empty, lex is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26**
