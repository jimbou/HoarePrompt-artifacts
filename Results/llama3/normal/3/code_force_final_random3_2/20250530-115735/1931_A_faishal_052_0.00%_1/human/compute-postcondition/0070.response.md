The code prints a character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Here, `k` is 3, and `arr` is a sorted list containing either [1, 1, lex-2], [26, 26, lex], or [26, 26, lex] based on the original value of `lex`.

Since `k` is 3, we are interested in the third element of the `arr` list. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, the third element is `lex-2`. If `lex` was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or more than 52, the third element is `lex`.

The expression `arr[k] + 96` adds 96 to the third element of the `arr` list. The `chr` function then converts this sum to the corresponding ASCII character.

Output: **the ASCII character corresponding to the value of the third element of the arr list plus 96**
