Postcondition: ***cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 0, arr is a list, stdin is empty, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and range is 2. If lex is an integer less than or equal to 26, then lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and arr is [1]. Otherwise, lex is an integer larger than 26 and arr is [26].***
