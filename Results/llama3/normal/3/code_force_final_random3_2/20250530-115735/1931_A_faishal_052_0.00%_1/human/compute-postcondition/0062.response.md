Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 0, arr is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, stdin is empty.**

The code appends the value of `lex` to the `arr` list and then sorts the list in ascending order. The initial state of `arr` depends on the original value of `lex`. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains 1 and 1, and `lex` is reduced by 2. If `lex` was originally less than 52 but more than 26, `arr` contains 26 and 26, and `lex` is less than or equal to 0. If `lex` was originally more than 52, `arr` contains 26 and 26, and `lex` is less than or equal to 0. After appending `lex` to `arr`, the list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `stdin` remains empty.
