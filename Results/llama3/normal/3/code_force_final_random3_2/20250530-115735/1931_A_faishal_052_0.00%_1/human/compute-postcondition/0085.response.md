To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for j in range(2):`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `cases` is at least 3
* `i` is 2
* `j` is 0
* `arr` is a list
* `stdin` is empty
* `k` is 3
* The characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed
* `range` is 2
* If `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, then `lex` is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and `arr` is [1]. Otherwise, `lex` is an integer larger than 26 and `arr` is [26]

Since the loop head only involves the variable `j` and the constant `2`, we can only adjust the state of `j`.

To execute the loop again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.

The other variables and states remain unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list, `stdin` is empty, `k` is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and `range` is 2. If `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, then `lex` is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and `arr` is [1]. Otherwise, `lex` is an integer larger than 26 and `arr` is [26]**
