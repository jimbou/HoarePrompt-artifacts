Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 1, arr contains 26, lex is reduced by 26**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 0. The value of `j` is also unchanged, which is 1. The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, so `arr` now contains the value 26. The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, but its original value is not specified, so we can only describe the change in its value. The state of `stdin` is not affected by the code, and since it was empty initially, it remains empty.
