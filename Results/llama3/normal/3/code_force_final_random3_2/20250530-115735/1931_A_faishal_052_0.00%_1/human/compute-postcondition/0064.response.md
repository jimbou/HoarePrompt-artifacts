The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of the first element of the list `arr` plus 96.
Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, the first element of the list `arr` is either 1 or 26.
Output: **a (if lex was originally less than or equal to 26) or a (if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26) or a (if lex was originally more than 52)**
