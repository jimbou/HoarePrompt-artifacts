Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 0, arr is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, stdin is empty, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of arr[0] + 96, arr[1] + 96, and arr[2] + 96 are being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the program remains the same as the initial state, except for the loop counter `k` which is now 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of the elements in the `arr` list are being printed. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and the `stdin` remains empty.
