Output: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, `stdin` is empty, `k` is 3, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k]` (which is the third element of the list `arr`) plus 96 is being printed.**
