Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 1, arr has an additional element 26, lex is reduced by 26**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the end of the list `arr`. This means that the length of `arr` increases by 1, and the new element 26 is added to the end of the list. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`. Since the initial value of `lex` is not specified, we can only say that `lex` is reduced by 26. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
