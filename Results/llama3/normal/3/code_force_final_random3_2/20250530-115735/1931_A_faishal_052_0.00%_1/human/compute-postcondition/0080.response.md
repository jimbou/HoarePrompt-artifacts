Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 0, arr is [26], stdin is empty, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, lex is an integer larger than 0 but less than 26, and the range is 2.**

In this final state, the value of `arr` has been modified to include the element `26`, and the value of `lex` has been reduced by `26`, resulting in a value between `0` and `26`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
