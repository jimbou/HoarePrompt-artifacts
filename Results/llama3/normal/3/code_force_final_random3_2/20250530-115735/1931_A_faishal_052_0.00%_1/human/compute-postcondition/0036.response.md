Output State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `arr` contains three elements, `lex` is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26, and the ASCII characters represented by the values of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` plus 96 have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, `stdin`, `arr`, and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial state. However, the loop has printed the ASCII characters represented by the values of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` plus 96.
