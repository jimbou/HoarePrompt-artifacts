Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2, arr contains either 1, 1, and 26, 1, 26, and 26, or 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27, less than or equal to 0, or less than or equal to 26.**

The code appends 26 to the end of the list arr and subtracts 26 from the value of lex. The initial state of arr and lex depends on the original value of lex. If lex was originally less than or equal to 26, then arr contains 1 and 1, and lex is reduced by 1 from its original value. After the code executes, arr will contain 1, 1, and 26, and lex will be reduced by 27 from its original value. If lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, then arr contains either 1 and 26 or 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27 or is less than or equal to 0. After the code executes, arr will contain 1, 26, and 26, or 26, 26, and 26, and lex will be less than or equal to 0. If lex was originally more than 52, then arr contains either 1 or 26, and lex is less than or equal to 26. After the code executes, arr will contain 1 and 26, or 26 and 26, and lex will be less than or equal to 0. The values of cases, i, and j are not affected by the code.
