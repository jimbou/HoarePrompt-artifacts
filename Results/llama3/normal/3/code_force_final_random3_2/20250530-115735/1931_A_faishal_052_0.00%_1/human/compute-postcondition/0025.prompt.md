Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer equal to the input value
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, j is 0. If lex is less than or equal to 26, arr is [1] and lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is less than or equal to 25. If lex is between 27 and 26, arr is [26] and lex is an integer between 0 and 26. If lex is larger than 26, arr is [26] and lex is an integer larger than 25.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 1. If lex is less than or equal to 26, arr contains at least one element which is 1 and lex is one less than its original value. If lex is more than 26 but less than 52, arr contains 26 and lex is reduced by 26. If lex is 52 or more, arr has an additional element 26 and lex is reduced by 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 2. If lex is less than or equal to 26, arr has one more element than before and lex is one less than its original value. Otherwise, arr has an additional element 26 and lex is 26 less than its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
