Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 1, arr contains 1 and 1, and lex is reduced by 1 from its original value.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` originally contained either 1 or 26, it now contains 1 and 1. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1. The original value of `lex` is not specified, but it is reduced by 1. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
