Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer equal to the input value**

Here's a description of the final state:

The initial state is modified by the code snippet. The variable `arr` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `lex` is assigned the integer value of the input from stdin. Since stdin contains only one input, which is an integer, after the execution of the code, stdin becomes empty. The values of `cases` and `i` remain unchanged.
