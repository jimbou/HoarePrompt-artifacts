Based on the precondition, we know that `arr` is a sorted list that includes the original elements of `arr` and `lex`. We also know that `k` is 2.

Since `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, we can deduce that `arr` is either [1, lex], [1, 1, lex], [1, 26, 1, lex], or [26, 1, 1, lex] or [26, 26, 1, lex].

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`

We know that `k` is 2, so `arr[k]` will be the third element of the `arr` list.

Since `arr` is a sorted list, the third element will be the smallest element in the list. Based on the possible values of `arr`, we can see that the third element will always be `lex`.

Therefore, `arr[k]` will be equal to `lex`.

Now, let's calculate the value of `chr(arr[k] + 96)`:

`chr(arr[k] + 96)` = `chr(lex + 96)`

Since `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, we can deduce that `lex + 96` will be a value between 97 and 122 (inclusive).

The `chr` function will convert this value to a character. Since the ASCII values between 97 and 122 correspond to the lowercase letters 'a' to 'z', we can conclude that `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will print a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z'.

Therefore, the output will be a single lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z', which corresponds to the value of `lex`.

Output: **a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'z' (which corresponds to the value of lex)**
