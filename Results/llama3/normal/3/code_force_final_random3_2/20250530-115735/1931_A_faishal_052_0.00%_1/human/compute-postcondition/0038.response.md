Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2, stdin is empty, arr is empty, lex is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `arr = []`, assigns an empty list to the variable `arr`, effectively clearing its previous contents. The second line, `lex = int(input())`, assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `lex`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not consume any input.

The initial state mentions that `lex` is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26. This reduction is not affected by the code snippet, so the final state of `lex` is still reduced by the same amount.

The ASCII characters represented by the values of `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` plus 96 have been printed, but since `arr` is now empty, there are no values to print.

The variables `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not modified by the code snippet, so their values remain the same. The `stdin` is still empty, as no input is consumed by the code.

In summary, the final state is that `arr` is empty, `lex` is reduced by the same amount as before, and the other variables remain unchanged.
