Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2, stdin is empty, arr is empty, lex is reduced by 52 if it was 52 or more, or by 26 if it was less than 52 but more than 26, or by 2 if it was less than or equal to 26.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 0, stdin is empty. If lex was originally less than or equal to 26, arr contains 1 and lex is reduced by 1. Otherwise, arr contains 26 and lex is less than or equal to 26

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 1, stdin is empty. If lex was originally less than or equal to 26, then arr contains 1 and 1, and lex is reduced by 1 from its original value. If lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, then arr contains either 1 and 26 or 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27 or is less than or equal to 0. If lex was originally more than 52, then arr contains either 1 or 26, and lex is less than or equal to 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2. If lex was originally less than or equal to 26, then arr contains 1 and 1 and 1, or 1 and 26 and 1, or 26 and 26 and 1, or 1 and 1, or 26 and 1, and lex is reduced by 1 from its original value. If lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, then arr contains either 1 and 26 and 26, 1 and 1 and 26, or 26 and 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27 or is less than or equal to 0. If lex was originally more than 52, then arr contains either 1, 1, and 26, 1, 26, and 26, or 26 and 26, and lex is either reduced by 27, less than or equal to 0, or less than or equal to 26.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
