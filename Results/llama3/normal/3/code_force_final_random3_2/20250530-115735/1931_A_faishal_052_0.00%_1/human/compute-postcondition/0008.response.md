Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, arr is [26], lex is an integer between 0 and 26, j is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` remains empty as it was initially empty and no input operations were performed. The value of `arr` is now a list containing a single element, 26, as it was appended by the first line of the code. The value of `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 26, as it was initially larger than 26 but less than 52, and was decremented by 26 in the second line of the code. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
