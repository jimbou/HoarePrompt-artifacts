Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, arr is [26], lex is an integer larger than 25, j is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, making it non-empty with a single element. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, reducing its value by 26. Since `lex` was initially an integer larger than 51, subtracting 26 will result in a value larger than 25. The other variables `cases`, `i`, `stdin`, and `j` are not affected by the code and remain in their initial state.
