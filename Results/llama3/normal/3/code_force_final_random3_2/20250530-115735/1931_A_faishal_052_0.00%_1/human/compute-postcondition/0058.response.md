Output State: **cases is at least 2, i is 1, j is 2, arr contains either 1, 1, and 26, or 1, 26, and 26, or 26, 26, and 26, or 1 and 26, or 26, and lex is less than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The first line appends 26 to the list `arr`, modifying its contents. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, reducing it. The initial state of `arr` and `lex` depends on the original value of `lex`. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, `arr` contained 1 and 1, and `lex` is reduced by 1 from its original value. If `lex` was originally less than 52 but more than 26, `arr` contained either 1 and 26 or 26 and 26, and `lex` is either reduced by 27 or is less than or equal to 0. If `lex` was originally more than 52, `arr` contained either 1 or 26, and `lex` is less than or equal to 26. After executing the code, `arr` will contain the additional value 26, and `lex` will be reduced by 26. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
