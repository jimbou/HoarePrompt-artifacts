Postcondition: ***cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and range is 2. If lex is an integer less than or equal to 26, then lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and arr is either [1], [1, 1], [1, 26, 1], or [26, 1, 1] or [26, 26, 1]. If lex is an integer larger than 26 but less than 52, then lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and arr is [1, 26] or [26, 1]. If lex is an integer larger than or equal to 52, then lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and arr is [1, 26] or [26, 1] or [1, 26, 26] or [26, 1, 26] or [26, 26, 26] with an additional element 26 appended to it.***
