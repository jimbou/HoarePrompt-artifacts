According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, so it needs to be adjusted to `cases` is at least 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains one input: t integers (3 <= n <= 78)**
