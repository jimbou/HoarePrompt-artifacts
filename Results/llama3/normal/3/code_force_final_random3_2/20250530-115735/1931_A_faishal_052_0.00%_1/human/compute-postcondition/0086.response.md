Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 1, arr is [26, 1] if lex is an integer larger than 26, otherwise arr is [1, 1], k is 3, range is 2, and lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 1.**

In this output state, the value of `lex` has been decremented by 1, and the list `arr` has been appended with the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `arr` depends on the original value of `lex`: if it was larger than 26, `arr` becomes [26, 1]; otherwise, `arr` becomes [1, 1].
