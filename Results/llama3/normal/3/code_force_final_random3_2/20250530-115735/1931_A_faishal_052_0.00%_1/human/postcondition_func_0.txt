This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of an integer value. For each case, it generates a sequence of characters based on the integer value and prints them. The sequence is generated by subtracting 1 or 26 from the integer value, depending on its magnitude, and appending the corresponding ASCII characters to the sequence. The sequence is then sorted and printed. The function repeats this process for each test case, emptying the standard input in the process.
