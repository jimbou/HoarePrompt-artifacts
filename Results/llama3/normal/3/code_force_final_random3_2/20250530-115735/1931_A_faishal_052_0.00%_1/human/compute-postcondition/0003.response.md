To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and the range `2`.

Since the loop will execute as long as the range `2` is greater than 0, we don't need to adjust the range. However, we do need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure it's within the range.

State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, arr is an empty list, lex is an integer equal to the input value, j is 0**
