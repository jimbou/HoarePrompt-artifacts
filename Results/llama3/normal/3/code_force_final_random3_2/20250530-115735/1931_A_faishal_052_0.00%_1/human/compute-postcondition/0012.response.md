Postcondition: ***cases is at least 1, i is 0, stdin is empty, j is 0. If lex is less than or equal to 26, arr is [1] and lex is an integer equal to its original value minus 1 and is less than or equal to 25. If lex is between 27 and 26, arr is [26] and lex is an integer between 0 and 26. If lex is larger than 26, arr is [26] and lex is an integer larger than 25.***
