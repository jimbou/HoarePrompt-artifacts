The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, but the loop can't execute again because j is not less than 2. So the loop can't execute again.
State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 2**
