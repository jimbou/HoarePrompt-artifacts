To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(2):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of values from 0 to 1 (since the upper limit is exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range, which is 2. However, since the range is only up to 1, the loop will not execute again.

But, since the task is to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `j` to make it possible for the loop to execute again.

State: **`cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and `range` is 2. If `lex` is an integer less than or equal to 26, then `lex` is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1 and `arr` is [1]. If `lex` is an integer larger than 26 but less than 52, then `lex` is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 1]. If `lex` is an integer larger than or equal to 52, then `lex` is an integer equal to its original value minus 26 and `arr` is [1, 26] or [26, 26].**
