To determine what will be printed when the `print` statement executes, let's break down the information given in the initial state and apply it step by step to the code snippet.

1. **Initial State Summary**:
   - `cases` is at least 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `stdin` is empty.
   - `arr` contains three elements.
   - `lex` has a reduction rule based on its value, but its current value isn't specified.
   - `k` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - The code snippet is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

3. **Variable Analysis**:
   - `k` is 1. This means we are interested in the second element of `arr` because list indices in Python start at 0.
   - `arr[k]` refers to the second element of `arr`. Since we don't know the exact elements of `arr`, we'll keep this as "the second element of `arr`".
   - `chr(arr[k] + 96)` converts the value of `arr[k] + 96` to a character. In ASCII, adding 96 to a number and converting it to a character will give us a lowercase letter (since 'a' starts at 97). However, without the exact value of `arr[k]`, we can't determine the exact character.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - Given that `arr[k]` is the second element of `arr` and without knowing its exact value, we can say that `chr(arr[k] + 96)` will print a lowercase letter corresponding to the value of `arr[k] + 96` in the ASCII table.
   - The `end=''` argument means that the print statement will not append a newline character at the end, so the next print statement will continue on the same line.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code will print a lowercase letter that corresponds to the value of the second element of `arr` plus 96 in the ASCII table.

Output: **a lowercase letter corresponding to the value of the second element of `arr` plus 96 in the ASCII table**
