Output State: **cases is at least 1, i is 0, j is 2, arr has an additional element 26, lex is 26 less than its original value**

The code block modifies the state of the program by appending the value 26 to the list `arr` and subtracting 26 from the value of `lex`. The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The original value of `lex` is not specified, so we can only describe the change in its value relative to its original value.
