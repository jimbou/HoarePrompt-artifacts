To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `k` and the range `3`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range `3` is greater than 0. Since `3` is a constant and always greater than 0, we don't need to adjust it.

However, we need to adjust the state of `k` to ensure it is within the range. Since the loop will iterate over the range `3`, we can set `k` to be within this range, for example, `k` is 0.

The other variables `cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states.

State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, `stdin` is empty, `k` is 0**
