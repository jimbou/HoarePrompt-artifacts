Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 0, arr is [1], stdin is empty, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, and lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 1, and the range is 2.**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the value 1 to the list `arr`, making `arr` equal to [1]. The second line decrements the value of `lex` by 1, making `lex` equal to its original value minus 1. No other variables are affected.
