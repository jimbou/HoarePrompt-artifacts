The code prints the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`, where `arr[k]` is the second element of the sorted list `arr` and `k` is 2.

Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the second element `arr[k]` is the second smallest element in the list. Based on the precondition, `arr` contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52.

In all cases, the second element `arr[k]` is 1 or 26. Adding 96 to this value gives an ASCII value that represents a character.

If `arr[k]` is 1, the ASCII value is 97, which represents the character 'a'.

If `arr[k]` is 26, the ASCII value is 122, which represents the character 'z'.

Therefore, the code prints either 'a' or 'z', depending on the value of `arr[k]`.

Output: **'a' or 'z' (where 'a' is printed if arr[k] is 1, and 'z' is printed if arr[k] is 26)**
