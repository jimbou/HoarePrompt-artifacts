The only variable in the loop head is variable `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 2.

State: **`cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order and contains either [1, 1, lex-2] if lex was originally less than or equal to 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally less than 52 but more than 26, or [26, 26, lex] if lex was originally more than 52, `stdin` is empty, `k` is 2, and the character represented by the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96` is being printed, where `arr[k]` is the second element of the sorted list `arr` and `k` is 2**
