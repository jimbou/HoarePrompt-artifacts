Postcondition: ***cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 0, arr is [26], stdin is empty, k is 3, and the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, range is 2. If lex is an integer larger than 0 but less than 26, then lex is an integer larger than 0 but less than 26. Otherwise, lex is an integer larger than 26 and larger than or equal to 26.***
