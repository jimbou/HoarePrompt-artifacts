Output State: **cases is at least 3, i is 2, j is 2, k is 3, the characters represented by the ASCII values of 96, 96, and 96 are being printed, range is 2, lex is an integer with a value equal to its original value minus 26, and arr is [1, 26] or [26, 1] or [26, 26] with an additional element 26 appended to it.**

The code modifies the value of `lex` and the list `arr`. The first line appends the value 26 to the list `arr`, resulting in `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, or `[26, 26, 26]`. The second line subtracts 26 from the value of `lex`, updating its value. The other variables remain unchanged.
