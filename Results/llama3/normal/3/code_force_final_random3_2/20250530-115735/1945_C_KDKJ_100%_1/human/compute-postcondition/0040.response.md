Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the string a and y is the number of '1's in the string a, stdin is empty, left is the number of '0's in the string a at index i+1, lsum is i+1, right is the number of '1's in the string a at index n minus the number of '1's in the string a at index i+1, rsum is n minus i+1.**

The code snippet assigns the value of `S[i][0]` to `left`, which is the number of '0's in the string `a` at index `i+1`. It also assigns the value of `i` to `lsum`. The value of `right` is assigned the difference between the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `n` and the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `i+1`, which is stored in `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. Finally, the value of `rsum` is assigned the difference between `n` and `i+1`. 

Note that the values of `n`, `a`, `S`, `stdin`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.
