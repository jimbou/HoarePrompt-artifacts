To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already an integer greater than or equal to 0, we can focus on `i`.

For the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 0, we can conclude that `n + 1` is at least 1. Therefore, we can set `i` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the string `a` and y is the number of '1's in the string `a`, `ans` is -1, stdin is empty, `i` is 0**
