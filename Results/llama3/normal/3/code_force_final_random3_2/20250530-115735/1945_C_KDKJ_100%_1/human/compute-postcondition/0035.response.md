Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, `left` is the number of '0's in the string `a` at index `i`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `n` minus the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `i`, `rsum` is `n` minus `i`, `i` is the value of `i` that is closest to `n/2 + 1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes to the variables, their values remain the same. The only effect is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
