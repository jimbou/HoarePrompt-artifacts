Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, `ans` is `i`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `i`, `left` is 0, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1]`, `rsum` is `n`, and either `left` is greater than or equal to `lsum/2` or `right` is greater than or equal to `rsum/2`. The current value of `i` is closer to `n/2` than the current value of `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is closer to `n/2` than the previous value of `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
