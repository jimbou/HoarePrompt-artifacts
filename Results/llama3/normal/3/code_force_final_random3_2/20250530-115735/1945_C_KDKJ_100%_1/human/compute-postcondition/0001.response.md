Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

Note: Since the code snippet only contains a function call without any information about the function's implementation, we can't determine the exact changes made to the variables. Therefore, the output state only indicates that the function `func_1()` has been executed, but the values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
