Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, `stdin` is empty, `left` is the number of '0's in the string `a` at index `i`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `n` minus the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `i`, `rsum` is `n` minus `i`, `i` is the value of `i` that is closest to `n/2 + 1`, `ans` is the value of `i` that is closest to `n/2 + 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ans` which is assigned the value of `i`, which is the value closest to `n/2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
