Output State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the remaining lists contain two elements: `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in `a`, stdin is empty.

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the string `a` will be empty, and the list `S` will contain `n+1` lists, where the first list is the initial state [0, 0], and the remaining lists will contain the count of '0's and '1's in the string `a`. The values of `x` and `y` in the last list of `S` will represent the total count of '0's and '1's in the original string `a`.
