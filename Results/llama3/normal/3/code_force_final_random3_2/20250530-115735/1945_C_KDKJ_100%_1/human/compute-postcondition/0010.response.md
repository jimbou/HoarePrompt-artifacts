Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n-1` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y`, where if `a[0]` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, if `a[0]` is '1', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, `s` is the first character of the string `a`, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either 0 or 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `S`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to be the last two elements of the list `S`, which are either 0 and 1 or 1 and 0, depending on the value of `a[0]`. The stdin remains empty.
