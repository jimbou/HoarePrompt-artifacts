Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed for each test case.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the input stream (`stdin`) still contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two inputs: a valid integer greater than 0 and a string of 0s and 1s that is the same length as the integer. Additionally, the function `func_1()` has been executed for each of these test cases.
