Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, `left` is the number of '0's in the string `a` at index `i+1`, `lsum` is `i+1`, `right` is the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `n` minus the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `i+1`, `rsum` is `n` minus `i+1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop continues to the next iteration.
