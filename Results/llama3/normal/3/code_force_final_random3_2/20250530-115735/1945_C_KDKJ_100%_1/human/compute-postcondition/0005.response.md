Output State: **`stdin` contains at least one more test case, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed, and the function `func_1()` has been executed again.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the function `func_1()` has been executed again. The values of the variables and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only executes the function `func_1()` without modifying any variables or reading from `stdin`.
