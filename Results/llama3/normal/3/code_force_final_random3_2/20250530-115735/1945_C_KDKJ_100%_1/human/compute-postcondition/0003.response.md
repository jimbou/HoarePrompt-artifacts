Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

Since the code snippet only contains the execution of the function `func_1()`, without any information about what this function does, the output state remains the same as the initial state. The function `func_1()` has been executed, but its effects on the program state are unknown.
