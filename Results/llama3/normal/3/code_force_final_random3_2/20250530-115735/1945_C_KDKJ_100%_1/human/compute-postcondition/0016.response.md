Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing three lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y`, the third list contains two elements: `x` and `y`, where if `a[1]` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0 if `s` is '0', otherwise `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if `a[1]` is '1', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1 if `s` is '0', otherwise `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, `s` is the second character of the string `a`, `x` and `y` are the last two elements of `S` which is the third list of `S` which is the same as the second list of `S` which is either [2,0] or [1,1] or [1,1] or [0,2], stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the values of `x` and `y` are now the last two elements of the list `S`, which are the same as the second list of `S`. The values of `x` and `y` are either [2,0], [1,1], or [0,2] depending on the value of `a[1]` and `s`.
