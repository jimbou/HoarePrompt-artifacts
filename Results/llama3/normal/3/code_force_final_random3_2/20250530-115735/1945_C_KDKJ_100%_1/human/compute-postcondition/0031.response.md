Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the string a and y is the number of '1's in the string a, stdin is empty, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is S[-1][1], rsum is n, and either left is greater than or equal to lsum/2 or right is greater than or equal to rsum/2. The value of ans is the value of i that is closest to n/2.***
