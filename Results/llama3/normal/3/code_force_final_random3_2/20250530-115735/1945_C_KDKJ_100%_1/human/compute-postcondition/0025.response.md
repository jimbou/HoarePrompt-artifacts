Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the string a and y is the number of '1's in the string a, ans is -1, stdin is empty, i is 0, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is S[-1][1], rsum is n**

The code assigns the value of `S[i][0]` to `left`, which is 0 since `i` is 0 and the first list in `S` contains two 0s. It then assigns the value of `i` to `lsum`, which is 0. The third line assigns the value of `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` to `right`, which is `S[-1][1]` since `S[i][1]` is 0. The fourth line assigns the value of `n - i` to `rsum`, which is `n` since `i` is 0. No other variables are affected.
