Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n-1` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y+1`, where if `a[0]` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 1, if `a[0]` is '1', then `x` is 0 and `y+1` is 2, `s` is the first character of the string `a`, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either 1 or 2, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, the string `a` remains the same, the list `S` remains the same except that the value of `y` in the second sublist is incremented by 1. The value of `s` remains the same. The value of `x` remains either 0 or 1, and the value of `y` is now either 1 or 2, depending on the value of `a[0]`. The stdin remains empty.
