Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, stdin is empty. If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` is equal to `i`.**
