Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing three lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y+1`, the third list contains two elements: `x` and `y+1`, where if `a[1]` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y+1` is 1 if `s` is '0', otherwise `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 2, if `a[1]` is '1', then `x` is 1 and `y+1` is 2 if `s` is '0', otherwise `x` is 0 and `y+1` is 3, `s` is the second character of the string `a`, `x` and `y+1` are the last two elements of `S` which is the third list of `S` which is the same as the second list of `S` which is either [2,1] or [1,2] or [1,2] or [0,3], stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain the same. The list `S` still contains three lists, but the second and third lists now have `y+1` as their second element. The possible values of `x` and `y+1` depend on the value of `a[1]` and `s`. The stdin remains empty.
