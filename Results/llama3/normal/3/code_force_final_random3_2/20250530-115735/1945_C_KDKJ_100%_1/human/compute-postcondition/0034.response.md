Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the string a and y is the number of '1's in the string a, stdin is empty, left is the number of '0's in the string a at index i, lsum is i, right is the number of '1's in the string a at index n minus the number of '1's in the string a at index i, rsum is n minus i, i is the value of i that is closest to n/2 + 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `S`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` are updated based on the values of `S` and `i`. Specifically, `left` is set to the number of '0's in the string `a` at index `i`, `lsum` is set to `i`, `right` is set to the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `n` minus the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `i`, and `rsum` is set to `n` minus `i`. The value of `i` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
