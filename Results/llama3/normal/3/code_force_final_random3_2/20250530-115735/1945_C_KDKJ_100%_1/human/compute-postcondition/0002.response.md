The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input.  If the input has at least one more test case the loop executes again for the next test case. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least one more test case and the input is the next test case.
State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed**
