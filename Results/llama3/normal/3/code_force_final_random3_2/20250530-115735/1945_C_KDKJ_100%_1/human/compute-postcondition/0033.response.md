The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the value of `i` that is closest to `n/2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the string a and y is the number of '1's in the string a, stdin is empty, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is S[-1][1], rsum is n, i is the value of i that is closest to n/2 + 1**
