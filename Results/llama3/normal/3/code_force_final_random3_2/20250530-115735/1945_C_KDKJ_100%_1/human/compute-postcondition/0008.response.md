Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y`, where if `a[0]` is '0', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0, if `a[0]` is '1', then `x` is 0 and `y` is 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `S` has been updated by appending a new list containing `x` and `y`, which are determined by the first character of the string `a`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty.
