Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an empty string, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: `x` and `y`, where `x` is the number of '0's in the string `a` and `y` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, `ans` is equal to `i`, `left` is the number of '0's in the string `a` at index `i+1`, `lsum` is `i+1`, `right` is the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `n` minus the number of '1's in the string `a` at index `i+1`, `rsum` is `n` minus `i+1`, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is now equal to `i`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The string `a` is still empty, and the list `S` still contains `n+1` lists with the same structure. The values of `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` are still dependent on the string `a` and the index `i`. The input stream is still empty.
