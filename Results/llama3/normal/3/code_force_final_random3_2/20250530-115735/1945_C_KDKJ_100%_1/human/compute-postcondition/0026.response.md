Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is an empty string, S is a list containing n+1 lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the rest of the lists contain two elements: x and y, where x is the number of '0's in the string a and y is the number of '1's in the string a, ans is -1, stdin is empty, i is 0, left is 0, lsum is 0, right is S[-1][1], rsum is n. The current value of left is either less than half of lsum or the current value of right is less than half of rsum.**
