The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the value of `i` that is closest to `n/2`. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `n/2` will be a float if `n` is odd, or an integer if `n` is even.

Output: **the value of i that is closest to n/2 (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 0)**
