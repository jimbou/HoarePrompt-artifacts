To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the `input()` function.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()` function returning a value that can be converted to an integer. If the input is not a valid integer, the loop will not execute.

Since the state before the loop starts mentions that `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case containing two inputs, we can infer that the first input is the integer that will be used in the `range()` function.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the first input is a valid integer greater than 0.

State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer**
