Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing four lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y`, the third list contains two elements: `x` and `y`, the fourth list contains two elements: `x` and `y`, where if `a[1]` is '0', then if `s` is '0', `x` is 3 and `y` is 0, otherwise `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, if `a[1]` is '1', then if `s` is '0', `x` is 2 and `y` is 1, otherwise `x` is 1 and `y` is 2, `s` is the second character of the string `a`, `x` and `y` are the last two elements of `S` which is the fourth list of `S` which is the same as the second list of `S` which is either [3,0] or [2,1] or [2,1] or [1,2], stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `S` now has an additional sublist containing the same values as the second and third sublists, which are either [3,0], [2,1], or [1,2] depending on the values of `a[1]` and `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
