The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least one more test case the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `stdin` must contain at least one more test case and the variable `_` is not used in the loop body so we can ignore it.
State: **`stdin` contains at least one more test case, each test case contains two inputs: the first input is a valid integer greater than 0, and the second input is a string of 0s and 1s of the same length as the integer, and the function `func_1()` has been executed**
