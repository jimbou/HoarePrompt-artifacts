This function reads a positive integer n and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1' from the standard input, then calculates and prints the index i that is closest to n/2, where i is the position in the string a that divides the string into two parts with the most balanced number of '0's and '1's. The function returns no value, only printing the result to the standard output.
