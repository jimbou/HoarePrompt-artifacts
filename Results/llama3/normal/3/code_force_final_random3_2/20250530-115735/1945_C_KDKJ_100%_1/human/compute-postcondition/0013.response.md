Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty string of length `n-1` consisting only of '0' and '1', `S` is a list containing two lists: the first list contains two elements: 0 and 0, the second list contains two elements: `x` and `y`, where if `a[0]` is '0', then `x` is 2 and `y` is 0 if `s` is '0', otherwise `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, if `a[0]` is '1', then `x` is 1 and `y` is 1 if `s` is '0', otherwise `x` is 0 and `y` is 2, `s` is the first character of the string `a`, `x` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `y` is either 0 or 1 or 2, stdin is empty.***
