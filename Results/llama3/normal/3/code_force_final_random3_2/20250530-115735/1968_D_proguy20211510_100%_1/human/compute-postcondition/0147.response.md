The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_` and the range object `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range object. If the range object has at least one more value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `_` has taken on the last value of the range object, and the range object has at least one value. So for the loop to be executed one more time the range object must have at least one more value.

State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least len(pathb) values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), pres is the sum of its original value and all values in paths, ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), i is len(paths) - 1, and paths is a list that must have at least len(paths) + 1 values, the range object must have at least one more value**
