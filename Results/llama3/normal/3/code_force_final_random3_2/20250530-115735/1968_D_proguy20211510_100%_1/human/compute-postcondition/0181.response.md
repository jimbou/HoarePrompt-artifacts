Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer equal to the value at index `ps` - 1 in list `p`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing the value at index `ps` - 1 in list `a` repeated for each iteration of the loop, `vis` is a list of `n` values with the value at index `ps` - 1 changed to 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
