Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the pb-1th index set to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input, _ is 0**
