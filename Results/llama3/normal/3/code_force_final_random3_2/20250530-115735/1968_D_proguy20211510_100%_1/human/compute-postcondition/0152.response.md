Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index pb - 1 changed to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of vis at index pb - 1 remains 1, and all other variables retain their initial values.
