Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the maximum score that can be achieved by traversing the circular path. The program correctly handles the case where the game lasts for k turns and the players can either stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation.

The program uses a visited array (vis) to keep track of the positions that have been visited by each player, and it correctly breaks the loop when a position is revisited, indicating that the player has completed a cycle.

The program also correctly calculates the maximum score for each player by iterating through their respective paths and considering the score that can be achieved by staying at each position or moving to the next position.

The program handles the case where the game lasts for k turns by only considering the scores that can be achieved within the first k turns.

The program correctly prints the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on their maximum scores.

Correctness: **True**
