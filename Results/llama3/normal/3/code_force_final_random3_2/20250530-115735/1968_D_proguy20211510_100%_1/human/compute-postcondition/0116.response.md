To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(pathb)):`. This means that the only object in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `pathb`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `pathb` contains at least 2 values. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `pathb` must still have at least 2 values.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 2
* `pathb` still contains at least 2 values

The other variables (`vis`, `pb`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, `paths`, `ps`, and `a`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least 2 values, `pb` is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `preb` is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 2, and `paths` contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1**
