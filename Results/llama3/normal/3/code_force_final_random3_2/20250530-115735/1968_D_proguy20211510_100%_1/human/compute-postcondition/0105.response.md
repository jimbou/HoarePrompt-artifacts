Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list 'vis' has the value at index 'ps - 1' changed to 1, 'pathb' contains the values of 'a[pb - 1]' until 'vis[pb - 1]' is 1, 'pb' is the last value of 'p[pb - 1]' before 'vis[pb - 1]' is 1, and 'resb', 'preb', 'ress', 'pres', and 'i' remain unchanged. The list 'paths' contains the values of 'a[ps - 1]' and the new value of 'ps' is 'p[ps - 1]', and the new value of 'paths' is the previous value of 'paths' with 'a[ps - 1]' appended, and 'a[ps - 1]' is appended to 'paths' and 'ps' is updated to 'p[ps - 1]' until 'vis[ps - 1]' is 1.
