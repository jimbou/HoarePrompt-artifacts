Output State: **vis is a list of n zeros with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1].**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of a[ps - 1] to the list paths. This means that the list paths now contains the value of a[ps - 1] in addition to its previous values. The second line assigns the value of p[ps - 1] to ps. This means that the value of ps is now the value of p[ps - 1]. 

The initial state of vis, pathb, pb, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remains unchanged as none of these variables are modified by the code snippet. The only changes are to the list paths and the variable ps.
