Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is the sum of its original value and paths[i], and i is equal to the length of paths plus one, stdin contains 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The program's state is updated based on the value of `vis[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of the variables is updated accordingly, including the values of `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is not 1, the program does not break out of the loop or if statement, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The program's state is updated based on the value of `vis[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of the variables is updated accordingly, including the values of `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i`. Additionally, `pathb` now includes the value of `a[pb - 1]`, and `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is not 1, the program does not break out of the loop or if statement, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *The value of `pathb` now includes the value of `a[pb - 1]`, and the value of `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise it continues with the unchanged state of the variables `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
