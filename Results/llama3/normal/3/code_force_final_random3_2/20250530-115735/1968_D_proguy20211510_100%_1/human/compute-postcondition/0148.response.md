Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index pb - 1 changed to 1, stdin contains no input**.

The code snippet reads four space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. It then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `p`, and another list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The `vis` list is initialized with `n` zeros, and the value at index `pb - 1` is changed to 1. The `pathb` and `paths` lists are initialized as empty lists. The `stdin` object is left empty after reading all the inputs.
