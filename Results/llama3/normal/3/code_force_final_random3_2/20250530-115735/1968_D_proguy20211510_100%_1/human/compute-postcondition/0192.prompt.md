Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer equal to the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, paths is a list containing the value at index ps - 1 in list a repeated for each iteration of the loop, vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, resb is 0, ress is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, k, pb, ps, p, a, paths, vis, ress, pres, and i are integers. If k is less than i + 1, then i is greater than or equal to k - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i]. resb is the maximum of its original value and the sum of preb and pathb[i] * (k - i).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, k, pb, ps, p, a, paths, vis, ress, pres are integers. curr is an integer equal to preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), resb is the maximum of its original value and curr, preb is incremented by pathb[i]. If k is less than i + 1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, k, pb, ps, p, a, paths, vis, ress, pres, i, and preb are integers, curr is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of pathb[i] and (k - i), resb is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and curr.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
