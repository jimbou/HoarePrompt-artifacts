Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the cycle length is greater than k. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by staying in the cycle.

For example, consider the input:

n = 5, k = 3, pb = 1, ps = 2
p = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1]
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

In this case, the cycle length is 5, which is greater than k = 3. The program will not correctly calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by staying in the cycle, and will incorrectly output "Draw" instead of "Bodya".

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when the cycle length is greater than k. One possible solution is to use a different approach to calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by staying in the cycle, such as using dynamic programming.
