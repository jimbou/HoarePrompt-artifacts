Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, paths is a list containing the value at index ps - 1 in list a and the value at index ps - 1 in list a, vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ps` and `paths`. The first line appends the value at index `ps - 1` in list `a` to `paths`, effectively adding a new element to the list. The second line assigns the value at index `ps - 1` in list `p` to `ps`, updating the value of `ps`. The value of `vis` is not modified by the code snippet, so it remains a list of `n` values with the value at index `ps - 1` changed to 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `p`, `a`, and `pathb`) remain unchanged.
