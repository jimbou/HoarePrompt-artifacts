Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least 1 value, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and curr, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is 0, pres is 0, i is 0, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `resb` and `preb` have been updated based on the calculations performed in the code. The value of `curr` is calculated as the sum of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i]` and `(k - i)`, and then `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `curr`. The value of `preb` is also updated by adding `pathb[i]` to its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
