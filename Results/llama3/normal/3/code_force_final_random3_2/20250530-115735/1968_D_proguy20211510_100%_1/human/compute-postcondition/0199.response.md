Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `pres` is incremented by `paths[i]`, `ress` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their previous values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
