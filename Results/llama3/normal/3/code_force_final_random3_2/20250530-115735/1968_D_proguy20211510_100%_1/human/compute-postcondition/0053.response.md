Output State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer equal to the value at index `pb-1` in list `p`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing the integer at index `pb-1` in list `a` repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with all indices set to 0 except for the `ps-1`th index which is set to 1, `ps` is the value at index `p[ps-1]-1` in list `p`, `paths` is a list containing the integer at index `ps-1` in list `a` repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index `ps-1` in list `a` and must have at least 1 element, `resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `preb` is the sum of its original value and `pathb[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `pres` is the sum of its original value and `paths[i]`, and `i` is 0.**

The code snippet updates the values of `ress`, `pres`, and `curr` based on the values of `paths`, `k`, and `i`. The first line calculates the value of `curr` as the sum of `pres` and the product of `paths[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`. The second line increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`. The third line updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its original value and `curr`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
