Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index ps-1 in list a and must have at least 3 elements, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is the sum of its original value and paths[i], i is 2, curr is the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, and ress is the maximum value between its original value and curr, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
