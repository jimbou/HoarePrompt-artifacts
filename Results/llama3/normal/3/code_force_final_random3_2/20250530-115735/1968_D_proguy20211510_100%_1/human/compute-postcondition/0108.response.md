Postcondition: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least 1 value, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is 0, preb is 0, ress is 0, pres is 0, i is 0, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1. The current value of k is less than i + 1.**
