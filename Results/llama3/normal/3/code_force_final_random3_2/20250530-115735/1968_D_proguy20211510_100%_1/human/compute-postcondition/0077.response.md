Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is the sum of its original value and paths[i], and i is equal to the length of paths plus one, stdin contains 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
