Postcondition: ***`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least len(pathb) values, `pb` is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `pres` is the sum of its original value and paths[i], `ress` is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), `i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least 3 values. If k < i + 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
