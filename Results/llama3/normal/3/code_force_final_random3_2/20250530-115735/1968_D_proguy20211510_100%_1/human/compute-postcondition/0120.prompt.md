Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is 0, preb is 0, ress is 0, pres is 0, i remains unchanged, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least 1 value, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and curr, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is 0, pres is 0, i is 0, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least 2 values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is 0, pres is 0, i is 1, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least 2 values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is 0, pres is 0, i is 2, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
