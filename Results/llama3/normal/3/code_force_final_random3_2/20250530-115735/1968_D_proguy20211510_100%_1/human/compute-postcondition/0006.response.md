Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the pb-1th index set to 1 and currently the value at index pb-1 in vis is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input, _ is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program execution will exit the current loop or if statement.
