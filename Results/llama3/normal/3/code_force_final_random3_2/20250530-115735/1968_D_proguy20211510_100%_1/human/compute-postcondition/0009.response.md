Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a and the integer at index pb-1 in list a, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the pb-1th index set to 1.**

The code first appends the integer at index pb-1 in list a to pathb, and then updates pb to be the value at index pb-1 in list p. This means that pathb now contains two integers: the original integer at index pb-1 in list a, and the new integer at index pb-1 in list a (which is the same as the original integer). The value of pb is also updated to be the value at index pb-1 in list p. All other variables remain unchanged.
