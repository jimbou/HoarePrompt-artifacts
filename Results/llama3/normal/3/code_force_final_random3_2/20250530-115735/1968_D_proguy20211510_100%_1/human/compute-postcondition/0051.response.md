Output State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer equal to the value at index `pb-1` in list `p`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list containing the integer at index `pb-1` in list `a` repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `vis` is a list of `n` integers with all indices set to 0 except for the `ps-1`th index which is set to 1, `ps` is the value at index `p[ps-1]-1` in list `p`, `paths` is a list containing the integer at index `ps-1` in list `a` repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index `ps-1` in list `a` and must have at least 1 element, `resb` is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i]` and the difference between `k` and `i`, `preb` is the sum of its original value and `pathb[i]`, and `i` is 0. The current value of `k` is less than `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables maintain their original values and properties.
