Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the pb-1th index set to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input, _ is 0**

The code executes two lines that modify the state of the program. The first line appends the integer at index `pb - 1` in list `a` to the list `pathb`. This means that `pathb` is no longer an empty list, but now contains one integer value. The second line assigns the value at index `pb - 1` in list `p` to the variable `pb`. This changes the value of `pb` to be equal to the value at that specific index in list `p`. No other variables are affected by the code.
