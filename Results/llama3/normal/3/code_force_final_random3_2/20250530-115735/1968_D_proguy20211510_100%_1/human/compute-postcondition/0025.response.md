Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is an integer equal to the value at index ps-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus one more integer at index ps-1 in list a, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional block.
