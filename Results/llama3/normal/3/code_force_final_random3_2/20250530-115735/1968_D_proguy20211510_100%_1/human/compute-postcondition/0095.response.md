Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of vis, pathb, pb, resb, preb, ress, pres, i, paths, and ps remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
