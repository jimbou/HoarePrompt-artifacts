Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `paths` is an integer, `vis` is an integer, `ress` is an integer, `pres` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables maintain their initial values, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
