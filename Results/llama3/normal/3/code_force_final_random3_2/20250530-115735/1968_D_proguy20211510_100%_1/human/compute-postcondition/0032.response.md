Output State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index ps-1 in list a. If the ps-1th index of vis is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until the ps-1th index of vis is 1. In each iteration, the value of ps is updated to the value at index ps-1 in list p, and the integer at index ps-1 in list a is appended to the list paths. The list pathb contains the integer at index pb-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop. The list vis remains unchanged except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1. The loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement when the ps-1th index of vis is 1.
