Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index ps-1 in list a, resb is 0, ress is 0, preb is 0, pres is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing at least one integer at index pb-1 in list a, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index ps-1 in list a, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], and i is an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing at least two integers at index pb-1 in list a, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index ps-1 in list a, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], and i is an integer incremented by 1. If k is less than i + 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing at least three integers at index pb-1 in list a, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index ps-1 in list a, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], and i is an integer incremented by 1. If k is less than i + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
