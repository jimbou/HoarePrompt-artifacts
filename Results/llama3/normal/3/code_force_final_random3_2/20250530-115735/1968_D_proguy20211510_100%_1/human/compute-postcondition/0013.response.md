Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a and the integer at index pb-1 in list a and the integer at index pb-1 in list a, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the pb-1th index set to 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `pathb` and `pb`. The first line appends the integer at index `pb-1` in list `a` to `pathb`, effectively adding a new element to the list. The second line updates the value of `pb` to be the integer at index `pb-1` in list `p`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
