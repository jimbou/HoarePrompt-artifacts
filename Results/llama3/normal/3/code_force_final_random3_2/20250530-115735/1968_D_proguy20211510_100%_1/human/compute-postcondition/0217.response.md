Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, and `paths` remain unchanged. `pres` is incremented by the sum of all elements in `paths` up to index `k - 1`, and `ress` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in range(len(paths)). Additionally, `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`. If `ress` is higher than `resb`, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.***
