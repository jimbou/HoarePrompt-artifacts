Output State: **n, k, pb, ps, p, a, pathb, vis, resb, preb, i, and paths are unchanged. pres is incremented by paths[i], and ress is updated to the maximum value between its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i).**

In this code snippet, we have three lines that modify the variables `pres`, `curr`, and `ress`. The first line calculates the value of `curr` by adding the product of `paths[i]` and `(k - i)` to `pres`. The second line increments `pres` by `paths[i]`. The third line updates `ress` to the maximum value between its original value and `curr`.

Since `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `i`, and `paths` are not modified by the code, their values remain unchanged. The only changes are to `pres` and `ress`, which are updated based on the calculations involving `paths[i]` and `k`.
