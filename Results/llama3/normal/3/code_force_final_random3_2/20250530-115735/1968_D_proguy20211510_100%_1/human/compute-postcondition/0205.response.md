Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `paths` remain unchanged. `pres` is incremented by `paths[i]`, and `ress` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.**

In this output state, all variables except `pres` and `ress` retain their original values. The value of `pres` is increased by the value of `paths[i]`, and the value of `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the expression `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
