Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index pb - 1 changed to 1, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[pb - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index pb - 1 changed to 1, and stdin contains no input. If vis[pb - 1] is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index pb - 1 changed to 1, and stdin contains no input. If the value at index pb - 1 in vis is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1], a[p[pb - 1] - 1], and a[pb - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index pb - 1 changed to 1. If vis[pb - 1] is 1, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
