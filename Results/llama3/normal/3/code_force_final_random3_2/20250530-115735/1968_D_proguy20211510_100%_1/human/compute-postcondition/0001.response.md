The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) on the first line, a list of n integers (p_1 to p_n) on the second line, and a list of n integers (a_1 to a_n) on the third line. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, and 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The list p_1 to p_n is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and the list a_1 to a_n contains positive integers. So for the loop to be executed  the input must have at least 1 test case and _ is 0.
State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases that must have at least 1 test case, _ is 0**
