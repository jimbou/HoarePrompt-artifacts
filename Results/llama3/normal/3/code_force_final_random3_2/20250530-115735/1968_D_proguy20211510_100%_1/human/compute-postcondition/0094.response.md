Postcondition: **vis is a list of n zeros with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1]. The current value of vis[ps - 1] is 1.**
