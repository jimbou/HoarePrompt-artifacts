Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. This means that the new value of `paths` is the previous value of `paths` with `a[ps - 1]` appended. The second line assigns the value of `p[ps - 1]` to `ps`. This means that the new value of `ps` is the value of `p[ps - 1]`.

All other variables, including `vis`, `pathb`, `pb`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The value of `vis` is still a list of `n` values with the value at index `ps - 1` changed to 1. The value of `pathb` is still the list of values of `a[pb - 1]` until `vis[pb - 1]` is 1. The value of `pb` is still the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.
