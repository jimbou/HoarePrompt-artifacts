Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least 2 values, `pb` is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `preb` is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 2, and `paths` contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1. If k is less than i + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
