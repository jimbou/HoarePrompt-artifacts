Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `paths` remain unchanged. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `pres` is incremented by `paths[i]`, and `ress` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
