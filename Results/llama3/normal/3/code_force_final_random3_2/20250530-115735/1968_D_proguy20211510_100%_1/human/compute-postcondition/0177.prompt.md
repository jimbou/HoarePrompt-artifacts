Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer equal to the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, paths is a list containing the value at index ps - 1 in list a, vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1. If the value at index ps - 1 in list vis is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, paths is a list containing the value at index ps - 1 in list a and the value at index ps - 1 in list a, vis is a list of n values. If the value at index ps - 1 in list vis is 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is the value at index p[ps - 1] - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, paths is a list containing the value at index ps - 1 in list a and the value at index ps - 1 in list a and the value at index ps - 1 in list a, vis is a list of n values. If the value at index p[ps - 1] - 1 in list vis is 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
