Output State: **n, k, pb, ps, p, a, paths, vis, ress, pres, and i are integers. If k is less than i + 1, then i is greater than or equal to k - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i]. resb is the maximum of its original value and the sum of preb and pathb[i] * (k - i).**

In this output state, the values of n, k, pb, ps, p, a, paths, vis, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged. The value of preb is updated by adding pathb[i] to its original value. The value of resb is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the sum of preb and pathb[i] * (k - i). The condition "if k is less than i + 1, then i is greater than or equal to k - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement" remains valid.
