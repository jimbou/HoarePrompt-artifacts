Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least len(pathb) values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), pres is the sum of its original value and paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), i is 1, paths is a list that must have at least 2 values, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `pres` and `ress`. The first line calculates a new value `curr` by adding the product of `paths[i]` and `(k - i)` to `pres`. The second line increments `pres` by `paths[i]`. The third line updates `ress` to be the maximum of its original value and `curr`. 

Note that the value of `i` is not modified in the given code snippet, so it remains 1. The values of `vis`, `pathb`, `pb`, `resb`, and `paths` are not affected by the code snippet, so they retain their original values.
