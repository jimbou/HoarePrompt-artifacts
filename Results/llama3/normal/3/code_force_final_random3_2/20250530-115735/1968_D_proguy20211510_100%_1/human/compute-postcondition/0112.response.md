To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(len(pathb)):`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `pathb`. If `i` is less than the length of `pathb`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `pathb` contains at least 1 value. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the length of `pathb` must be at least 2.

State: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least 2 values, `pb` is the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and `curr`, `preb` is the sum of its original value and `pathb[i]`, `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 1, and `paths` contains the values of `a[ps - 1]` and the new value of `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, and the new value of `paths` is the previous value of `paths` with `a[ps - 1]` appended, and `a[ps - 1]` is appended to `paths` and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1**
