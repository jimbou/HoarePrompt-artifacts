Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) on the first line, a list of n integers (p_1 to p_n) on the second line, and a list of n integers (a_1 to a_n) on the third line. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, and 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The list p_1 to p_n is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and the list a_1 to a_n contains positive integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is the value at index p[ps-1]-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus the number of iterations of the loop minus one more integers at index ps-1 in list a, resb is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of preb and the product of pathb[i] and the difference between k and i, preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is the maximum value between its original value and the sum of pres and the product of paths[i] and the difference between k and i, pres is the sum of its original value and paths[i], and i is equal to the length of paths. The program prints 'Bodya' if resb is greater than ress, 'Sasha' if ress is greater than resb, and 'Draw' otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least len(pathb) values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), pres is the sum of its original value and all values in paths, ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), i is len(paths) - 1, and paths is a list that must have at least len(paths) values, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1. If the current value of resb is greater than the current value of ress, 'Bodya' is printed. Otherwise, if ress is greater than resb, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is: `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, and `paths` remain unchanged. `pres` is incremented by the sum of all elements in `paths` up to index `k - 1`, and `ress` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` in range(len(paths)). If `resb` is greater than `ress`, 'Bodya' is printed. If `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`, then if `ress` is higher than `resb`, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
