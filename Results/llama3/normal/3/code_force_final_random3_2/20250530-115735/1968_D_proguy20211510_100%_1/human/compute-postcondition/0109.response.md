Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least 1 value, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is 0, preb is 0, ress is 0, pres is 0, i is 0, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement.
