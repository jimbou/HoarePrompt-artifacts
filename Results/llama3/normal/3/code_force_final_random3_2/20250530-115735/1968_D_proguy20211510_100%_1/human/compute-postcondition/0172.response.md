Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, paths is a list containing the value at index ps - 1 in list a and the value at index ps - 1 in list a, vis is a list of n values. If the value at index ps - 1 in list vis is 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
