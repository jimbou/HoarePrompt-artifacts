Postcondition: ***The value of `pathb` now includes the value of `a[pb - 1]`, and the value of `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise it continues with the unchanged state of the variables `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i`.***
