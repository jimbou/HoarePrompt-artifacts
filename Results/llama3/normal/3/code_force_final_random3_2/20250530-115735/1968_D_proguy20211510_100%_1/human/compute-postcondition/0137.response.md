Output: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least len(pathb) values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), pres is the sum of its original value and all values in paths, ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), i is len(paths) - 1, and paths is a list that must have at least len(paths) values, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1. The current value of resb is greater than the current value of ress, and 'Bodya' is printed**
