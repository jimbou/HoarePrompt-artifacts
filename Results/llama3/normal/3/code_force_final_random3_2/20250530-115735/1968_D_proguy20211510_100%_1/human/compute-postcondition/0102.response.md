Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1].**

In this output state, the values of vis, pathb, pb, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are in the paths and ps variables. The value of a[ps - 1] is appended to the paths list, and the value of ps is updated to p[ps - 1].
