To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(len(paths)):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is 0, and `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 value.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `paths`. Since `i` is currently 0, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 1. Additionally, the length of `paths` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables mentioned in the state, such as `vis`, `pathb`, `pb`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, `ps`, and `a`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least len(pathb) values, `pb` is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `preb` is the sum of its original value and all values in pathb, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), `pres` is the sum of its original value and paths[i], `i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 2 values, `paths` contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.**
