Output State: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least len(pathb) values, `pb` is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `pres` is the sum of its original value and paths[i], `ress` is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), `i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least 3 values and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
