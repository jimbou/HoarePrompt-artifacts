Output State: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least len(pathb) values, `pb` is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `preb` is the sum of its original value and all values in pathb, `ress` is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), `pres` is the sum of its original value and paths[i], `i` is 1, `paths` is a list that must have at least 2 values, `paths` contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of breaking out of the loop or if statement.
