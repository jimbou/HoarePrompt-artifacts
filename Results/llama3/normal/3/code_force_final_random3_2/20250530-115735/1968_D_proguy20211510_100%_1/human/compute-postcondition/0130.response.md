To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `paths`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `paths`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `paths` has at least 2 values.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, since `paths` has at least 2 values, it must have at least 3 values for the loop to execute again.

State: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least len(pathb) values, `pb` is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `pres` is the sum of its original value and paths[i], `ress` is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), `i` is 2, `paths` is a list that must have at least 3 values**
