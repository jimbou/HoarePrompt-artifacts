Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with the pb-1th index set to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of YES, NO, MOD, and alpha remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variables n, k, pb, and ps are assigned integer values from the first line of input. The lists p and a are populated with integer values from the next two lines of input. The lists pathb and paths are initialized as empty lists. The list vis is initialized with n zeros, with the pb-1th index set to 1. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines of input, as two lines of input have been consumed by the code. The variable _ remains unchanged at 0.
