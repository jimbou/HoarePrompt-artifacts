Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `paths`, `vis`, `ress`, `pres`, `curr`, `resb`, and `preb` are integers, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The value of `i` is still one more than its previous value, and all other variables remain unchanged.
