Output State: **vis is a list of n zeros with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, and resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the list `vis` has been initialized with `n` zeros, and then the value at index `ps - 1` has been set to 1. The other variables, including `pathb`, `pb`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i`, remain unchanged from their initial state.
