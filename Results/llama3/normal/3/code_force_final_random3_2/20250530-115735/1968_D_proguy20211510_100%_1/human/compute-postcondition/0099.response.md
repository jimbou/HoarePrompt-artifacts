Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged, paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means that the execution of the innermost loop or if statement is terminated. The values of all variables remain unchanged, except that the execution flow is now outside the innermost loop or if statement.
