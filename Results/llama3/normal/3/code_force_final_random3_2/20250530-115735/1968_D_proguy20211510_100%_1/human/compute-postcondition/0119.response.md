Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least 2 values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is 0, pres is 0, i is 2, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `preb` and `resb`. The first line calculates the value of `curr` as the sum of `preb` and the product of `pathb[i]` and `(k - i)`. The second line increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. The third line updates `resb` to be the maximum of its original value and `curr`. 

The values of `vis`, `pathb`, `pb`, `ress`, `pres`, `i`, and `paths` remain unchanged. The value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the calculated value of `curr`. The value of `preb` is incremented by the value of `pathb[i]`.
