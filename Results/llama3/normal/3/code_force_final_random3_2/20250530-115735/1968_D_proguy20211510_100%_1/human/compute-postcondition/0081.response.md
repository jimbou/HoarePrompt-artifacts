Postcondition: **The program's state is updated based on the value of `vis[pb - 1]`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the state of the variables is updated accordingly, including the values of `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i`. If `vis[pb - 1]` is not 1, the program does not break out of the loop or if statement, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
