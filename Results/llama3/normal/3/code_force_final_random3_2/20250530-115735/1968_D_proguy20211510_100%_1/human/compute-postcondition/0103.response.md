Output State: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index `ps - 1` changed to 1, `pathb` contains the values of `a[pb - 1]` until `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `pb` is the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i` remain unchanged, `paths` contains the values of `a[ps - 1]` and the new value of `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`, and the new value of `paths` is the previous value of `paths` with `a[ps - 1]` appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `vis` has its value at index `ps - 1` changed to 1. The list `pathb` still contains the values of `a[pb - 1]` until `vis[pb - 1]` is 1. The variable `pb` remains the last value of `p[pb - 1]` before `vis[pb - 1]` is 1. The variables `resb`, `preb`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i` are unchanged. The list `paths` now contains the values of `a[ps - 1]` and the new value of `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. Additionally, the new value of `paths` is the previous value of `paths` with `a[ps - 1]` appended. Finally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
