To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `pathb`. The loop will execute if `pathb` has at least one element. Since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the first index of `pathb`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer equal to the value at index `ps` - 1 in list `p`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `pathb` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `paths` is a list containing the value at index `ps` - 1 in list `a` repeated for each iteration of the loop, `vis` is a list of `n` values with the value at index `ps` - 1 changed to 1, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0**
