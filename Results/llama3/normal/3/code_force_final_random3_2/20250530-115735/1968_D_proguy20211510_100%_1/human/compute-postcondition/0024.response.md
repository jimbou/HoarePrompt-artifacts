Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1, ps is an integer equal to the value at index ps-1 in list p, paths is a list containing the integer at index ps-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop plus one more integer at index ps-1 in list a.**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the integer at index ps-1 in list a to paths. The second line assigns the value at index ps-1 in list p to ps. The value of ps is updated to be the value at index ps-1 in list p. The value of paths is updated to include one more integer at index ps-1 in list a. No other variables are affected.
