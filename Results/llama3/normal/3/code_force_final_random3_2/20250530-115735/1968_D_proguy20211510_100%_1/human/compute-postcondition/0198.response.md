The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `paths`. If `i` is less than the length of `paths`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unchanged, and the length of `paths` is also unchanged. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, `vis`, `resb`, `preb`, `pres` is incremented by `paths[i]`, `ress` is updated to the maximum value between its original value and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
