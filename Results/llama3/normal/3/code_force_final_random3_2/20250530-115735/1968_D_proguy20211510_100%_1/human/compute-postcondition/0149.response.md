Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once, regardless of the values of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is an empty list, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index pb - 1 changed to 1, stdin contains no input**
