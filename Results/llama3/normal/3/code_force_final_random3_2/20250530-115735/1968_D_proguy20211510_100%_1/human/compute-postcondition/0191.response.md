Output State: **n, k, pb, ps, p, a, paths, vis, ress, pres, i, and preb are integers, curr is an integer equal to its original value plus the product of pathb[i] and (k - i), resb is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and curr.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `paths`, `vis`, `ress`, `pres`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `curr` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the product of `pathb[i]` and `(k - i)`. The value of `resb` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the new value of `curr`. The value of `preb` is incremented by `pathb[i]`.
