Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer, ps is an integer equal to the value at index ps - 1 in list p, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list of integers, paths is a list containing the value at index ps - 1 in list a, vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1. If the value at index ps - 1 in list vis is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
