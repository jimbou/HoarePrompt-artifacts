Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **vis is a list of n zeros with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains the values of a[pb - 1] until vis[pb - 1] is 1, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, and resb, preb, ress, pres, and i remain unchanged.**
