Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least 2 values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), preb is the sum of its original value and pathb[i], ress is 0, pres is 0, i is 1, and paths contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `resb` and `preb` have been updated based on the calculations performed in the code. The value of `resb` is now the maximum of its original value and the result of the expression `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, which takes into account the current value of `preb`, the value of `pathb[i]`, and the difference between `k` and `i`. The value of `preb` has been incremented by the value of `pathb[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
