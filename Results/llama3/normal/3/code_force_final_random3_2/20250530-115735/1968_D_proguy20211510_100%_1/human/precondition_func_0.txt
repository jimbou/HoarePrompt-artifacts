stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) on the first line, a list of n integers (p_1 to p_n) on the second line, and a list of n integers (a_1 to a_n) on the third line. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, and 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The list p_1 to p_n is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and the list a_1 to a_n contains positive integers.
