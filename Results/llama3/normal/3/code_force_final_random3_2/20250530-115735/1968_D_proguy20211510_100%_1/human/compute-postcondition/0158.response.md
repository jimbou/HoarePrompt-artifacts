Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute again, regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is p[p[pb - 1] - 1], ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing a[pb - 1] and a[p[pb - 1] - 1], paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n values with the value at index pb - 1 changed to 1, and stdin contains no input.**
