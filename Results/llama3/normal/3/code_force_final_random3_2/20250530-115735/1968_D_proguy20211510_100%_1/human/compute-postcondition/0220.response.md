Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on the maximum score they can achieve by traversing a circular path. The function takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) and two lists of n integers (p_1 to p_n and a_1 to a_n). The function calculates the maximum score for each player by iterating through their respective paths and prints the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on their maximum scores.**
