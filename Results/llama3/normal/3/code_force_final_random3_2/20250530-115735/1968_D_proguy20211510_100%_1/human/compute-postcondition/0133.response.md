Output State: **vis is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, pathb contains at least len(pathb) values, pb is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, resb is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), pres is the sum of its original value and paths[i] + paths[i], ress is the maximum of its original value and pres + paths[i] * (k - i), i is 2, paths is a list that must have at least 3 values.**

The code block modifies the values of `pres`, `ress`, and `curr`. The first line calculates a new value `curr` based on `pres`, `paths[i]`, and `k - i`. The second line increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`. The third line updates `ress` to be the maximum of its original value and the newly calculated `curr`. The values of `vis`, `pathb`, `pb`, `resb`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `paths` also remains unchanged, but it is used in the calculations.
