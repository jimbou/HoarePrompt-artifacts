Since the `while` loop statement is `while True`, it will always execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state.

State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer, k is an integer, pb is an integer equal to the value at index pb-1 in list p, ps is an integer, p is a list of integers, a is a list of integers, pathb is a list containing the integer at index pb-1 in list a repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, paths is an empty list, vis is a list of n integers with all indices set to 0 except for the ps-1th index which is set to 1**
