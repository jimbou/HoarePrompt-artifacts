According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `paths`. If `paths` has at least 1 value, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `len(pathb) - 1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `paths` must have at least 1 value.

State: **`vis` is a list of n values with the value at index ps - 1 changed to 1, `pathb` contains at least len(pathb) values, `pb` is the last value of p[pb - 1] before vis[pb - 1] is 1, `resb` is the maximum of its original value and preb + pathb[i] * (k - i), `preb` is the sum of its original value and all values in pathb, `ress` is 0, `pres` is 0, `i` is 0, `paths` is a list that must have at least 1 value, `paths` contains the values of a[ps - 1] and the new value of ps is p[ps - 1], and the new value of paths is the previous value of paths with a[ps - 1] appended, and a[ps - 1] is appended to paths and ps is updated to p[ps - 1] until vis[ps - 1] is 1**
