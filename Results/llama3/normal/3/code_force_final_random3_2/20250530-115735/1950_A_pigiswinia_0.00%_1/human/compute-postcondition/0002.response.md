Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, stdin contains at least 0 lines**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers from the input, which are converted from strings to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function. The `input().split()` function splits the input line into three parts, which are then assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the input line is consumed, the stdin now contains at least 0 lines.
