Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, stdin contains at least 0 lines, and either `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c`. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.***
