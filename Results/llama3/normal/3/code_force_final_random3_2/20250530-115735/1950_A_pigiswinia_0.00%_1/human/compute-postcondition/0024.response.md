Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains at least -1 lines. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. If `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not greater than `c`, then 'NONE' is printed.***
