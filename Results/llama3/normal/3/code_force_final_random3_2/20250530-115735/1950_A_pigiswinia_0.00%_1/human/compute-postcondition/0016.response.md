Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains at least -1 lines. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers read from the input. The stdin now contains at least -1 lines because one line of input has been consumed. The conditions for printing 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' are still valid, but the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now determined by the input.
