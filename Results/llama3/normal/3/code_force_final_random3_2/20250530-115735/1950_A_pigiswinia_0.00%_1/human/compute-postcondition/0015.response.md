The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, stdin contains at least 0 lines. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**
