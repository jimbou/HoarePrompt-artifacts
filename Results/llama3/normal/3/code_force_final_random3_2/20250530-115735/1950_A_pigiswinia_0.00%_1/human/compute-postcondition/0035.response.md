Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains at least `t-1` lines. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then 'STAIRS' is printed. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, then 'PEAK' is printed. Otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged (between 1 and 1000), the loop counter `i` has reached `t-1`, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` have been assigned values from the input. The standard input (stdin) contains at least `t-1` lines. The conditions for printing 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' remain the same as in the initial loop.
