To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `int(w // 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `w` must be at least 2.

State: **q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, w is an integer greater than 1, i is 1**
