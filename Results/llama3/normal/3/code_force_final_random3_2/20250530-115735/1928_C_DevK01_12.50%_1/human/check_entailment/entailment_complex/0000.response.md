Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The problem requires finding the number of natural numbers `k` that fit under the given constraints, where `k` is the number of people in the first `k-th` position in a line, and `n` is Vasya's position in the line, and `x` is the number Vasya received during the settling.
2.  The program correctly calculates the possible values of `k` by considering the divisors of `y = n + x` and `n - x` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is because `k` must be a divisor of `y` and `n - x` to satisfy the given constraints.
3.  The program uses a helper function `func_1` to find the divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This function correctly finds all divisors of `q` that meet this condition.
4.  The program then combines the divisors found for `y` and `n - x` (if `n >= 3 * x - 2`) and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set. This ensures that each possible value of `k` is counted only once.
5.  Finally, the program prints the number of unique possible values of `k`, which is the length of the set `L1`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
