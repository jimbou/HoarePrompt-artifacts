Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer, `M` is a list that contains `i` and `q // i` and the current value of `q` is a multiple of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include the result of the integer division of `q` by `i`, which is `q // i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `q` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` is still valid.
