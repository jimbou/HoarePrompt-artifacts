Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `w`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list that contains the value of `i`, the value of `q // i`, the value of `i` appended at the end, and the value of `q // i` appended at the end. Otherwise, `M` is a list that contains the value of `i`, the value of `q // i`, and the value of `i` appended at the end.***
