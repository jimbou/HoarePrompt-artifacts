Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than or equal to `q`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`. Otherwise, `M` is a list containing all integers `i` such that `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is divisible by `i`, and all integers `q // i` such that `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is divisible by `i`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `q` remains unchanged, the value of `x` remains unchanged, and the value of `w` is greater than or equal to `q`. The list `M` contains all integers `i` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and divide `q`, as well as all integers `q // i` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and divide `q`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` contains only the square root of `q`. Otherwise, `M` contains all the integers `i` and `q // i` that meet the conditions.
