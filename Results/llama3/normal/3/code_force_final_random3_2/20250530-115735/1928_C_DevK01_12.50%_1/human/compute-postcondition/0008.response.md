Postcondition: ***q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than q, w is an integer greater than 1. If the current value of i is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list that contains i and the current value of q is a multiple of i. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of q, x, w, and i.***
