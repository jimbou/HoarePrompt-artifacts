Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than `w`, `M` is a list that contains the value of `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values, and a new list `M` is created that contains the value of `i`. The list `M` now holds the value of `i`, which is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than `w`.
