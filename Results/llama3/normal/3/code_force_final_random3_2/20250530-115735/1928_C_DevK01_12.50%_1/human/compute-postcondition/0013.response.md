To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(w // 1)`. Since `i` is an integer, we can increment it by 1 for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is a multiple of `i`. However, these conditions do not affect the loop head, so we don't need to adjust `q` or `x`.

The only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1. Since `w` is an integer greater than 1, `int(w // 1)` will be the same as `w`.

State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than `w`**
