Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `w`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list that contains the value of `i`, the value of `q // i`, the value of `i` appended at the end, and the value of `q // i` appended at the end. Otherwise, `M` is a list that contains the value of `i`, the value of `q // i`, and the value of `i` appended at the end.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `q`, `x`, `w`, and `i` remains the same. The list `M` is updated by appending the value of `q // i` to it, but only if the conditions `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` and `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1` are met. If these conditions are not met, the list `M` remains unchanged.
