Postcondition: ***`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than `w`. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list that contains the value of `i` and the value of `q // i`.***
