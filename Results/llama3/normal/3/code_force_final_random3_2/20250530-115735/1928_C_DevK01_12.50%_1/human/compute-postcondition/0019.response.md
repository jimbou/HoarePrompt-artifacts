To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `w`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `w // 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than `w`, and `w` is an integer greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `w`. The value of `w` remains the same.

The other variables `q`, `x`, and `M` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `w`. If `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list that contains the value of `i` and the value of `q // i`.**
