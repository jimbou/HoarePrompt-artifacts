Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than `q`, `w` is an integer greater than 1, `M` is a list that contains `i`, the current value of `q` is a multiple of `i`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their relationships with each other are still valid.
