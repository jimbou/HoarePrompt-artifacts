Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. It first checks if the sum of n and x is even, and if not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. If the sum is even, it calculates the list of possible values for k using the func_1 function and then prints the length of the list after removing duplicates.

The func_1 function correctly calculates the list of possible values for k by iterating over all factors of q (which is (n + x - 2) // 2 or (n - x) // 2) and checking if they are greater than or equal to x - 1. It also checks if the square root of q is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1, and if so, adds it to the list.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including when n is less than 3x - 2, and when the sum of n and x is odd. It also correctly removes duplicates from the list of possible values for k before printing the length of the list.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints, and it handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
