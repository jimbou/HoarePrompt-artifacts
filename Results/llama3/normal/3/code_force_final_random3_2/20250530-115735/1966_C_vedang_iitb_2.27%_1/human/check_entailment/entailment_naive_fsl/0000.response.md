Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly determine the winner of the game.

In the function `func_2`, the program checks if the current player can win by recursively calling itself with the remaining piles. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the players can remove stones from each nonempty pile at once.

For example, consider the case where the input is `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. The program will incorrectly determine that Bob wins, because it does not consider the fact that Alice can remove 3 stones from each pile at once, emptying all the piles and winning the game.

To correctly determine the winner, the program should calculate the Nim-sum of the piles, which is the bitwise XOR of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is 0, then Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The program does not implement this correct approach.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
