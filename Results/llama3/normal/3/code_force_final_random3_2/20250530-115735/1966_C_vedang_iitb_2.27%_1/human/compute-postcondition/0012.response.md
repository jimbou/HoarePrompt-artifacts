Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `a`. `n` is larger than 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. `winNext` is returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. Additionally, `winNext` is not equal to 2 and if `winNext` is 1, then `a[0]` is equal to 1***
