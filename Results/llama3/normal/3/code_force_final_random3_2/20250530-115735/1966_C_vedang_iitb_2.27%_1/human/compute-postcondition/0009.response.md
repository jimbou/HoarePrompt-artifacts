Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `a`. `n` is larger than 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. `winNext` is returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `a` and the integer `n` remain unchanged, but a new variable `winNext` is introduced, which is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2` when called with the arguments `a[1:]` (the list `a` without its first element) and `n - 1`.
