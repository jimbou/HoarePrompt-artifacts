Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of `a`. `n` is larger than 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. The current value of `winNext` is either 2 or 1, and if `winNext` is 1, then the first element of `a` is not 1. `winNext` is returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`***
