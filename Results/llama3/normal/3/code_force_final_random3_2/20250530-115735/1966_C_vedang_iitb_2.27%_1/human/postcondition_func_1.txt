Determines the outcome of a game based on a list of non-negative integers and its length. Returns 1 if the game is won, and 2 if the game is lost. The function considers the parity of the first element in the list and the outcome of a recursive call with the rest of the list. If the list has only one element, the function returns 1. If the list has two elements, the function returns 1 if the first element is even, and 2 otherwise. For lists with more than two elements, the function returns 1 if the outcome of the recursive call is 2 or if the outcome is 1 and the first element is not 1, and returns 2 otherwise.
