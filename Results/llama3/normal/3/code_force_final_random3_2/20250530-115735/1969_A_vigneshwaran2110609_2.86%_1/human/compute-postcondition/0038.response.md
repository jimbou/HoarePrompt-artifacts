The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases.**
