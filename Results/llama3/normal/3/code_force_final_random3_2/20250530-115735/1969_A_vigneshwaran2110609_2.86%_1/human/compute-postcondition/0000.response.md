Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `n` has been assigned a value between 2 and 50 (inclusive) from the input, and the remaining input in stdin consists of t-1 test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n distinct integers.
