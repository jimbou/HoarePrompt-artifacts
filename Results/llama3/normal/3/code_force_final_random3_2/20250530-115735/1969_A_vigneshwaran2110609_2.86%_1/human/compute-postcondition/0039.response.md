Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases, `flag` is True**

The code assigns the value `True` to the variable `flag`. The values of the other variables (`x`, `i`, `n`, `l`) are not affected by this code. The stdin still contains `t-x-2` test cases.
