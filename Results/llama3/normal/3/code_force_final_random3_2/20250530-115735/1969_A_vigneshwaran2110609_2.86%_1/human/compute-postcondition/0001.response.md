The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is 0**
