Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there are two friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, because Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, because Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to ensure that at least two friends come to the party.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the fact that all `p_i` are distinct and that `p_i != i`. It also correctly handles the case where `n` is 2, in which case Monocarp only needs to send invitations to both friends.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
