Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n distinct integers. It then checks each list to see if there exists an integer p_i such that p_i is equal to the integer at index p_i - 1 in the list. If such an integer is found, it prints 2 and moves on to the next test case. If no such integer is found after checking all integers in the list, it prints 3. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.**
