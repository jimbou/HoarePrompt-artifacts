Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is 0, `flag` is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`.**

In this output state, a new variable `flag` is introduced and assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1` still holds, as the code does not modify the list `l` or the index `i`. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
