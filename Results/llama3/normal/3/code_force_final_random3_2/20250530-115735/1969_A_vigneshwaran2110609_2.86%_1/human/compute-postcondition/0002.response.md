Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), x is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), l is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `x` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The list `l` is created from the second line of the input, containing `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i). The variable `i` remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been read and processed.
