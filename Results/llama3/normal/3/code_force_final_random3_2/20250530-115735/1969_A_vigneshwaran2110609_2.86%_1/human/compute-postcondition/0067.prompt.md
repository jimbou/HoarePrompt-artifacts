Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is equal to `x`, stdin contains t-x test cases. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1` at any point during the loop execution, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: x is an integer between 0 and 49 (inclusive), i is equal to x, n is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), l is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases. If the loop executed x times without breaking, then flag is False and the number 3 is printed. Otherwise, flag is True and the number 2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `x`, `n` is an integer between `x+1` and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_n` (1 <= `p_i` <= `n`; `p_i` != `i`), stdin contains `t-x-4` test cases, flag is True, and the number 2 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
