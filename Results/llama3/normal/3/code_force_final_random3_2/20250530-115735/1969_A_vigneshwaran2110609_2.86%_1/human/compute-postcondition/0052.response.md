Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-4 test cases, flag is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-x-4 test cases. The number 2 is still printed. The current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is still equal to `l[i] - 1`. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
