The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `x`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is equal to `x`, stdin contains t-x test cases. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. So `i` is `x+1` and `n` is an integer between `x+1` and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is equal to `x+1`, stdin contains t-x-1 test cases.
State: **`n` is an integer between `x+1` and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is equal to `x+1`, stdin contains t-x-1 test cases**
