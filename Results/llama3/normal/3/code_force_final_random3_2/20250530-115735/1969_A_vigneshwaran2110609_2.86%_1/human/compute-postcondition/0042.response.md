Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases, `flag` is True, the number 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values, as the `break` statement only terminates the execution of the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The only additional information is that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
