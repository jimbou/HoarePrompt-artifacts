Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases, `flag` is True**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains t-x-2 test cases. A new variable `flag` is introduced and assigned the value True.
