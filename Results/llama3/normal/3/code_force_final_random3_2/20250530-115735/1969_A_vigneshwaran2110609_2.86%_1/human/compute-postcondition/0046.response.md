Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), i is equal to x, n is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), l is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-4 test cases, flag is True and the number 2 is printed.**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was already an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), its value is updated to the input value. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `l`. Since `l` was already a list of `n` distinct integers, its value is updated to the input list. The value of `i` remains equal to `x`. The value of `n` remains an integer between `x+1` and 50 (inclusive). The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2, from `t-x-3` to `t-x-4`. The flag is set to True and the number 2 is printed.
