Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is equal to `x`, stdin contains t-x test cases. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1` at any point during the loop execution, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the number 3 is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, and the value of `i` is now equal to `x`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, except for the number of test cases left in stdin, which decreases by the number of iterations executed. If the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met at any point during the loop, the program prints 2 and breaks out of the loop; otherwise, it prints 3.
