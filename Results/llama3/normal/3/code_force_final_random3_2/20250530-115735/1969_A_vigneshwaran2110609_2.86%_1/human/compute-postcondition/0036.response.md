Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases, `flag` is True, and the number 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `x`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `flag`, and the number of test cases in stdin remain unchanged.
