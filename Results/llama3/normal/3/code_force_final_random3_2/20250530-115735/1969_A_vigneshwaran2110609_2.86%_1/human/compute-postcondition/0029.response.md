Output: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `flag` is True, stdin contains t-x-2 test cases. The current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, and the number 2 is being printed**
