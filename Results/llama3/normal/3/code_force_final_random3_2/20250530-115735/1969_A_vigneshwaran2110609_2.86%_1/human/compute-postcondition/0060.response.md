To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `x` remains the same.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-5 test cases, flag is True, and the number 2 is printed.**
