Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
