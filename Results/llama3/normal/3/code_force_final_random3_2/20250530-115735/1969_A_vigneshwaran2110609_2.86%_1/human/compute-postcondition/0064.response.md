Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-5 test cases, flag is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `x`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-x-5 test cases. The number 2 is printed. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
