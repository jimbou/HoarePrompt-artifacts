Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is 2, `flag` is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code simply assigns the value True to the variable `flag`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `x`, `l`, `i`) and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
