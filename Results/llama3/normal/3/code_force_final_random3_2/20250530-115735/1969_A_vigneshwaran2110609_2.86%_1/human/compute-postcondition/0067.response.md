Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `x`, `n` is an integer between `x+1` and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of `n` distinct integers `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_n` (1 <= `p_i` <= `n`; `p_i` != `i`), stdin contains `t-x-2` test cases, flag is True, and the number 2 is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be between 0 and 50 (inclusive), and `i` will be equal to `x`. The value of `n` will be between `x+1` and 50 (inclusive), and `l` will be a list of `n` distinct integers `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_n` (1 <= `p_i` <= `n`; `p_i` != `i`). The standard input (stdin) will contain `t-x-2` test cases. Additionally, the flag will be True, and the number 2 will be printed.
