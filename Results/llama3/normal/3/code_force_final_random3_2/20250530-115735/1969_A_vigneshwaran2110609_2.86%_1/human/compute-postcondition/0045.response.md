State: **x is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), i is equal to x, n is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), l is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-3 test cases. If the loop executed x times without breaking, then flag is False and the number 3 is printed. Otherwise, flag is True and the number 2 is printed.**
