To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The state of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `n`, `l`, `flag`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases**
