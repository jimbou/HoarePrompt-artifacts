Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
