Output State: **x is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), l is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), i is equal to x+1, stdin contains t-x-2 test cases**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, it remains so. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `l`. Since `l` was a list of `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= `p_i` <= `n`; `p_i` != `i`), it remains so. The value of `n` is not affected by the code, so it remains an integer between `x+1` and 50 (inclusive). The value of `i` is not affected by the code, so it remains equal to `x+1`. Stdin contains `t-x-2` test cases after the code execution.
