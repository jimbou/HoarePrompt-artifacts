Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
5
3 1 2 5 4

The program will print 2, but the correct answer is 3. This is because the program only checks if there are two friends who are each other's best friends, but it does not consider the case where there are more than two friends who are each other's best friends.

In this case, friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends, but friend 3 is also friend 1's best friend, and friend 2 is also friend 3's best friend. Therefore, the minimum number of invitations needed is 3, not 2.

The program does not handle this case correctly, and therefore it is incorrect.
