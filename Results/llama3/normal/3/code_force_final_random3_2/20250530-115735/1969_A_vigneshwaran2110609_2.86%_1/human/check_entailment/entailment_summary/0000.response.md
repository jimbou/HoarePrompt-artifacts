Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at the party.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of friends and the list of best friends. It then checks each list to see if there exists an integer p_i such that p_i is equal to the integer at index p_i - 1 in the list. If such an integer is found, it means that there are two friends who are each other's best friends, and sending invitations to both of them will result in at least 2 friends attending the party. In this case, the program prints 2.

If no such integer is found after checking all integers in the list, it means that there are no two friends who are each other's best friends. In this case, the program prints 3, which is the minimum number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends at the party.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
