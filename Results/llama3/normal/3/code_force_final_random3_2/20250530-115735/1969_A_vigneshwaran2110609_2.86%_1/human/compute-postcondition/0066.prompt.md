Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), i is equal to x, n is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), l is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-4 test cases, flag is True and the number 2 is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-4 test cases, flag is True, the number 2 is printed. If the element at index l[i] - 1 in list `l` is equal to l[i] - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-5 test cases, flag is True, and the number 2 is printed. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-5 test cases, flag is True, and the number 2 is printed. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
