Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-4 test cases, flag is True, the number 2 is printed. If the element at index l[i] - 1 in list `l` is equal to l[i] - 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
