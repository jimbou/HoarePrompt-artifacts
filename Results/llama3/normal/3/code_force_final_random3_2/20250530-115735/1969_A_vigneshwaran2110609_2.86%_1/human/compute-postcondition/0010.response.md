The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
