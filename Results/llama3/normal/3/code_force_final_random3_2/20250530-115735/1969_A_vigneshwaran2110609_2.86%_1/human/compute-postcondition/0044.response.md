Output State: **x is an integer between 0 and 49 (inclusive), i is equal to x, n is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), l is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases. If the loop executed x times without breaking, then flag is False and the number 3 is printed. Otherwise, flag is True and the number 2 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations means that the loop has finished running. The value of `x` has decreased by the number of iterations, and `i` is now equal to the final value of `x`. The list `l` and the value of `n` remain unchanged. If the loop completed all its iterations without finding a match, the flag is False and the number 3 is printed. If a match was found and the loop broke early, the flag is True and the number 2 is printed.
