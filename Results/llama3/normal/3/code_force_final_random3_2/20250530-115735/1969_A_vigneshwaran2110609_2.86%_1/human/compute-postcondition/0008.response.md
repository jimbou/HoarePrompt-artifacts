Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is 0, `flag` is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, and the number 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The condition `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1` still holds true. The number 2 is still being printed. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
