Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), `i` is 2, `flag` is True, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the number 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `x`, `l`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-2 test cases, as one test case has been processed. The number 2 is still being printed. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
