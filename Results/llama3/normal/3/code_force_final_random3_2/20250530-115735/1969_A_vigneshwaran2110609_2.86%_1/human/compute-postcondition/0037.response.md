Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between x+1 and 50 (inclusive), `l` is a list of n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i), stdin contains t-x-2 test cases. If the value at index l[i] - 1 in list `l` is equal to l[i] - 1, then `flag` is True, the number 2 is printed, and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
