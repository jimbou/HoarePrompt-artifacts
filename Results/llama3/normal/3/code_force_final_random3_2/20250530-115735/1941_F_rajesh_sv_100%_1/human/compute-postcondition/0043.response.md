Output State: **l is either equal to h or greater than h - 1, h is either equal to l or less than l + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables l and h have converged to the same value or are at most one apart, and the mid variable is the average of l and h. The mid_sum and mid_next_sum variables are updated accordingly based on the values of mid and f. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
