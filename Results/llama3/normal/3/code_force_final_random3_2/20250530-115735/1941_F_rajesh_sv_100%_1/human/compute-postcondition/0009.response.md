Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 1, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]`, `next_max_diff` is less than `max_diff`, and `index` is 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is either -inf or `A[1] - A[0]`, and `index` is None.***
