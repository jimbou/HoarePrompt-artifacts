Output State: **n is at least 3, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct integers, F is a list of k integers, i is 2, diff is A[2] - A[1], next_max_diff is A[2] - A[1], max_diff is A[2] - A[1], and index is 2.**

The code snippet consists of three lines, each modifying a different variable. The first line assigns the value of `max_diff` to `next_max_diff`. Since `max_diff` is either -inf or `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` becomes either -inf or `A[2] - A[1]`. The second line assigns the value of `diff` to `max_diff`. Since `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` becomes `A[2] - A[1]`. The third line assigns the value of `i` to `index`. Since `i` is 2, `index` becomes 2. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
