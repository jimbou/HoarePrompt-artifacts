Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `h` is equal to `l`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`**

In this output state, the values of `l`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of two expressions: `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. This means that `ans` will be the smallest value it has seen so far, which is either its previous value or the maximum of these two expressions.
