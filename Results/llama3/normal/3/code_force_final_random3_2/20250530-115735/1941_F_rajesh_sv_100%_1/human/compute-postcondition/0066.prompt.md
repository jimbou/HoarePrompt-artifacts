Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is not updated, mid_sum is not updated, mid_next_sum is not updated, ans is not updated, f is the next value in F
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, l < h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to mid.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than mid + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is the average of the original l and h plus 1, otherwise l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, and h is the average of l and h.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, and mid is the average of l and h. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is greater than or equal to mid + 1 and h is greater than l. Otherwise, l is less than mid and h is the average of l and h.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
