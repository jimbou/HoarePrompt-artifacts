Postcondition: ***l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, and mid is the average of l and h. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is greater than or equal to mid + 1 and h is greater than l. Otherwise, l is less than mid and h is the average of l and h.***
