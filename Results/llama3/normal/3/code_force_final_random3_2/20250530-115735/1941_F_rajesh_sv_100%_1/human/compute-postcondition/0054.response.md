Output State: **`l` is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and is equal to mid, `l` < `h`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is D[mid] + f, and `mid_next_sum` is D[mid + 1] + f. The difference between `mid_sum` and left is not less than the difference between right and `mid_next_sum`.**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is the average of `l` and the original value of `h`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true.
