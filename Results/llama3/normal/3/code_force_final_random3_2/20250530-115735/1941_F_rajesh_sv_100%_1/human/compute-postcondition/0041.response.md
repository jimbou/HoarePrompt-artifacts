Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `n`, `diff` is `A[n - 1] - A[n - 2]`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or less than `h`, `h` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `h`, which is now equal to `mid`. The lists `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged, and the indices `i`, `index`, `left`, `right`, `ans`, `l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` retain their original values.
