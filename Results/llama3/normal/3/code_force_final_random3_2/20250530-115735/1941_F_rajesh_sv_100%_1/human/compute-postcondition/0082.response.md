Output State: **`l` is less than `h`, `l` is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and greater than `l`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is D[mid] + f, `mid_next_sum` is D[mid + 1] + f, `ans` remains unchanged and `h` is now equal to `mid`**
