Postcondition: ***l is either equal to h or greater than h - 1, h is either equal to l or less than l + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If l is equal to h, ans is the minimum of its previous value and max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f).***
