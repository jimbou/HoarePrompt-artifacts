State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is greater than or equal to h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, and ans is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f if l is equal to h. Otherwise, the values of l, h, mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum, and ans remain unchanged.**
