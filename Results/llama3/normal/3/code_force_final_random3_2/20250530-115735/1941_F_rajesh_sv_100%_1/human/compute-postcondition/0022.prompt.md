Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct integers, F is a list of k integers, max_diff is -inf, next_max_diff is -inf, and index is None
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
    if diff > max_diff:
        next_max_diff = max_diff
        max_diff = diff
        index = i
    elif diff > next_max_diff:
        next_max_diff = diff


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 1, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]`, `next_max_diff` is less than `max_diff`, and `index` is 1. Otherwise, `max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is either -inf or `A[1] - A[0]`, and `index` is None.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, and `index` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains either -inf or `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is either `A[2] - A[1]` or remains unchanged, and `index` is either None or 2. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is either -inf or `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is either `A[3] - A[2]` or remains unchanged, and `index` is either None or 3. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, and `index` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` and `index` remain unchanged, but if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]` and `index` is updated to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
