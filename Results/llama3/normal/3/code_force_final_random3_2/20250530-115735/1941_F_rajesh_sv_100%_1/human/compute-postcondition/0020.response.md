Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is either -inf or `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is either `A[3] - A[2]` or remains unchanged, and `index` is either None or 3. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]` and `index` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` and `index` remain unchanged.***
