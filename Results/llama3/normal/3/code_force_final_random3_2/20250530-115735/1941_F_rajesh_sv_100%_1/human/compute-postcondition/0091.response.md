Output State: **`l` is equal to `h`, `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `l` is equal to `h`, the expression `D[l] + f - left` is equivalent to `D[h] + f - left`, and `right - D[l] - f` is equivalent to `right - D[h] - f`. Therefore, `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[h] + f - left` and `right - D[h] - f`.
