The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `testcases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `testcases`. If `testcases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `testcases` must be greater than 1.
State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()` that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the return value of `func_6()` has been returned**
