Output State: **l is equal to mid + 1, l is less than h, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, ans remains unchanged. The current value of mid_sum minus left is less than the current value of right minus mid_next_sum.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of l has been updated to be mid + 1. The relationship between l and h remains the same, with l being less than h. The values of mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum, and ans remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of mid_sum minus left is less than the current value of right minus mid_next_sum still holds true.
