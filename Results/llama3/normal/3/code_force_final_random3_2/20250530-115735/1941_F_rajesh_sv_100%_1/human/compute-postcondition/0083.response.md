Postcondition: ***l is less than h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and greater than l, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, ans remains unchanged. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, l is now greater than or equal to the average of the old l and h. Otherwise, h is now equal to mid***
