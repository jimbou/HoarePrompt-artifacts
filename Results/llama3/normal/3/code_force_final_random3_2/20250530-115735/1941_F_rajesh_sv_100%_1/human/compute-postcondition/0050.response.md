Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, l < h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The relationship between `l` and `h` also remains valid, ensuring that `l` is less than `h`. The code introduces two new variables, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`, which are calculated based on the values of `l` and `h`. The value of `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, while `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are the sums of `D[mid]` and `D[mid + 1]` with `f`, respectively.
