The only objects in the loop head are variables  `_` and `testcases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `testcases`.  If `testcases` is greater than 1 the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` is greater than 1, `_` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `_` is 2 and `testcases` is greater than 2.
State: **`testcases` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the return value of `func_6()` has been returned again**
