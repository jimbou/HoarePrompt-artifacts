Postcondition: **l is less than h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, ans remains unchanged. The current value of mid_sum minus left is less than the current value of right minus mid_next_sum.**
