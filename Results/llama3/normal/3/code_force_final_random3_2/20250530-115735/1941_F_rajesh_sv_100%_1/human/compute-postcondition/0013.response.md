Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, `max_diff` is either -inf or `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`, and `index` is either None or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `next_max_diff` has been updated to be equal to `diff`, which is `A[2] - A[1]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
