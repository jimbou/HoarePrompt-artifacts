Output State: **l is equal to h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum remain unchanged, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables l and h will be equal, and l will be the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, while h will be the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1. The values of mid, mid_sum, and mid_next_sum will remain unchanged. The variable ans will be updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.
