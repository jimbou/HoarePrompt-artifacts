Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is either -inf or `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, and `index` is either None or 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `i`, `diff`, `max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged. The only change is that `next_max_diff` is now equal to `diff`, which is `A[3] - A[2]`.
