The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`, and `index` is updated to 3. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains either -inf or `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is either `A[3] - A[2]` or remains unchanged, and `index` is either None or 3. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[3] - A[2]`.**
