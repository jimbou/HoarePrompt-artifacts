To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l < h`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order and `l` is less than `mid`, and `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 and `h` is greater than `mid + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `l` is still less than `h`. Since `l` is less than `mid` and `h` is greater than `mid + 1`, we can conclude that `l` is less than `h` if `mid` is less than `h - 1`.

However, we cannot adjust `mid` because it is not a variable in the loop head. Therefore, we need to adjust `h` to ensure that `l` is less than `h`. We can do this by making `h` greater than `l + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**
