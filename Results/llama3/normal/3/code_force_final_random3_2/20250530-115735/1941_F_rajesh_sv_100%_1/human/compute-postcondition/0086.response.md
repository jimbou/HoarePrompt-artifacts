Output State: **`l` is the average of the original `l` and `h` plus 1, `h` is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and greater than `l`, `mid` is the average of the original `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is D[mid] + f, `mid_next_sum` is D[mid + 1] + f, `ans` remains unchanged, and `l` is less than `h`**.

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be the average of the original `l` and `h` plus 1, while the values of `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `h` is still maintained, with `l` being less than `h`.
