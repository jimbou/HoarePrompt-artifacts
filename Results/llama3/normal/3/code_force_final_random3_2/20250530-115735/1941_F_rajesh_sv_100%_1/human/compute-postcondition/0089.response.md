Output State: **l is equal to h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum, and ans remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop terminates when l is equal to h. At this point, l and h have converged to the same value, which is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, and h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1. The values of mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum, and ans remain unchanged from their initial values.
