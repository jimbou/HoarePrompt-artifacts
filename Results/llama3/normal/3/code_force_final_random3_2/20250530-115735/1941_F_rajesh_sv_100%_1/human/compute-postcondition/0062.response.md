Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than l + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

The first line updates the value of `mid` to be the average of `l` and `h`, which is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. This new value of `mid` is used in the second line to update `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`. `mid_sum` becomes `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` becomes `D[mid + 1] + f`. The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
