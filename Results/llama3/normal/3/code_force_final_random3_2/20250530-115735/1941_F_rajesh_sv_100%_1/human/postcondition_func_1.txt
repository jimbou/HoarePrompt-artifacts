The function retrieves or computes and stores the result of applying the function `func` to the arguments in the tuple `args`, and returns this result. If `args` is not already a key in the dictionary `d`, it is added with the computed result as its value. The function ensures that `d` contains an entry for `args` with the corresponding result, and returns this result.
