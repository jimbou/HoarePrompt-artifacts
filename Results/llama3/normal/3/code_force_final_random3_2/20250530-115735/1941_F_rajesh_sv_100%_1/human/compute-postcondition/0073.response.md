Output State: **l is less than h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, ans remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `mid` is calculated as the average of `l` and `h`, which is a new value that is not present in the initial state. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are calculated based on the values of `D[mid]` and `D[mid + 1]` respectively, and are new values that are not present in the initial state. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
