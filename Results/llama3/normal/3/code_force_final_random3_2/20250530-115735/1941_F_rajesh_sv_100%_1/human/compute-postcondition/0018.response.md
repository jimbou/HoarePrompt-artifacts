Output State: **n is at least 4, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct integers, F is a list of k integers, i is 3, diff is A[3] - A[2], next_max_diff is A[3] - A[2], max_diff is A[3] - A[2], and index is 3.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 3. The value of `diff` is still `A[3] - A[2]`, which is the difference between the third and second elements of list `A`. The value of `next_max_diff` is updated to be the same as `max_diff`, which is `A[3] - A[2]`. The value of `max_diff` is also updated to be the same as `diff`, which is `A[3] - A[2]`. Finally, the value of `index` is updated to be the same as `i`, which is 3.
