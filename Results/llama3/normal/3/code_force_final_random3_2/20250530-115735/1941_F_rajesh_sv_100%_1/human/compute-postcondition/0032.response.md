Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct integers, F is a list of k integers that must have at least 1 element, i is n, diff is A[n - 1] - A[n - 2], max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is A[index - 1], right is A[index], ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, f is the first element in the list F, l is the insertion point for left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l must be less than h, h is the insertion point for right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus one, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum, then l is updated to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is updated to the average of l and h.**
