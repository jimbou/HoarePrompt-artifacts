Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, h is the average of l and h.**

In this output state, the value of h has been updated to be equal to mid, which is the average of l and h. The values of l, mid, mid_sum, and mid_next_sum remain unchanged. The relationship between l and mid, and the relationship between mid and h, are also preserved.
