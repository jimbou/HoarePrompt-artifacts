Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, and `index` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains either -inf or `A[2] - A[1]`, `next_max_diff` is either `A[2] - A[1]` or remains unchanged, and `index` is either None or 2. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`.***
