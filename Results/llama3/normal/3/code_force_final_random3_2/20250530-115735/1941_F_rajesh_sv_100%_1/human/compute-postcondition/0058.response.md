Output State: **`l` is the average of the original `l` and `h` plus 1, `h` is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and `h` is greater than `mid + 1`, `mid` is the average of the original `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be the average of the original `l` and `h` plus 1, while the values of `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `mid` has also changed, as `l` is now greater than or equal to `mid + 1`.
