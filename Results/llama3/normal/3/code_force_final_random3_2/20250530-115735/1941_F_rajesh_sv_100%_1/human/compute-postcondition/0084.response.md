To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, we have the following conditions:

* `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order.
* `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 and greater than `l`.
* `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`.
* `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
* `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
* `ans` remains unchanged.

We also have two possible scenarios:

1. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is now greater than or equal to the average of the old `l` and `h`.
2. Otherwise, `h` is now equal to `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` to satisfy the condition `l < h`. We can do this by making `l` less than `h` in both scenarios.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`l` is less than `h`, `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1 and greater than `l`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `l` is less than `h`**
