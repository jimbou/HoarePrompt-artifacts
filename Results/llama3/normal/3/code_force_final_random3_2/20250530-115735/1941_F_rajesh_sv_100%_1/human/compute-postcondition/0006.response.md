Output State: **`testcases` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the return value of `func_6()` has been returned again**.

The code simply calls the function `func_6()` without assigning its return value to any variable or using it in any way. Therefore, the state of the variables `testcases` and `_` remains unchanged. The only effect of the code is that the return value of `func_6()` is returned again, but since it is not used or assigned anywhere, it does not have any impact on the state of the program.
