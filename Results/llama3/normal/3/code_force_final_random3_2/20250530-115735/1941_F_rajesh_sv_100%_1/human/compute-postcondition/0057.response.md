Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than mid + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

The code snippet updates the values of `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`. The first line calculates the average of `l` and `h` and assigns it to `mid`. The second line calculates the sum of `D[mid]` and `f` and assigns it to `mid_sum`, and the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f` and assigns it to `mid_next_sum`. The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
