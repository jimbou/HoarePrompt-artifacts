To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `l` and `h` so that `l` is still less than `h`.

From the given state, we know that `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, and `l < h`. We also know that `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `l` is still less than `h` after the update. Since `l` is updated to `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, we need to make sure that `mid + 1` is still less than `h`. Similarly, since `h` is updated to `mid` if `mid_sum - left` is not less than `right - mid_next_sum`, we need to make sure that `mid` is still greater than `l`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `h` to be greater than `mid + 1`, and the state of `l` to be less than `mid`. We cannot adjust the states of `mid`, `mid_sum`, or `mid_next_sum` because they are not in the loop head.

State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than mid + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**
