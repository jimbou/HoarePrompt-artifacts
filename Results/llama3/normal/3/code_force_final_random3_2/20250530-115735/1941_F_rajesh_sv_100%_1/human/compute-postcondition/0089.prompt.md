Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is greater than or equal to h, mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum, and ans remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *l is less than h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, ans remains unchanged. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is equal to mid + 1. Otherwise, h is equal to mid.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *l is less than h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and greater than l, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, ans remains unchanged. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, l is now greater than or equal to the average of the old l and h. Otherwise, h is now equal to mid
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: l and h are updated to maintain the sorted order of D with respect to f, such that l is the insertion point of left - f in D and h is the insertion point of right - f in D minus 1, with l being less than h, and mid and mid_next_sum are updated accordingly, while ans remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
