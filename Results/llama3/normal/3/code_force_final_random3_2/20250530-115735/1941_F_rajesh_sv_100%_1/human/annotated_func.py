#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a function that takes at least one argument
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns a wrapper function that takes at least one argument, but the exact behavior of the wrapper function is not defined in the given code snippet.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns a wrapper function that takes at least one argument, but the exact behavior of the wrapper function is not defined in the given code snippet.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of values of any type and d is a dictionary where keys are tuples of values of any type and values are results of the function func for the corresponding keys.
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: *args is a tuple of values of any type, d is a dictionary where keys are tuples of values of any type and values are results of the function func for the corresponding keys. If args was not in d, then args is now a key in dictionary d with a value equal to func(*args).
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the result of the function func for the arguments in the tuple *args, which is stored as the value for the key *args in dictionary d. If *args was not initially in d, it is now a key in d with a value equal to func(*args).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function retrieves or computes and stores the result of applying the function `func` to the arguments in the tuple `args`, and returns this result. If `args` is not already a key in the dictionary `d`, it is added with the computed result as its value. The function ensures that `d` contains an entry for `args` with the corresponding result, and returns this result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that was read from the standard input (stdin) with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from the standard input (stdin), removes leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_2() returns a string that represents an integer.
    return int(func_2())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_2()

#Overall this is what the function does:The function converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_2() into an actual integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are obtained by splitting the string returned by func_2() into substrings separated by the delimiter string and then converting each substring to an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a delimiter string as input and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by first obtaining a string from an external function (func_2()), then splitting this string into substrings based on the provided delimiter, and finally converting each substring into an integer. The function's purpose is to parse a string into a list of integers, with the delimiter determining how the string is segmented. Upon conclusion, the function provides a list of integers as output, with the original input string and delimiter having been processed but not altered.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be extracted from this function as it does not take any arguments.
    return func_2()
    #The program returns the value returned by the function func_2().

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calls another function named func_2 and returns its result, effectively acting as a proxy or wrapper for func_2 without modifying or adding any functionality.

    #State: l is equal to h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum remain unchanged, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.
    print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
    #This is printed: the maximum of the minimum value represented by ans and the maximum difference represented by next_max_diff

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum maximum difference between two consecutive elements in a list A and a list D, considering a list F of integers. It first finds the maximum and second maximum differences between consecutive elements in A, then iterates over F to find the minimum maximum difference between A and D. The function returns the maximum of the minimum maximum difference and the second maximum difference.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: testcases is a non-negative integer

    #State: `testcases` is the return value of `func_3()`, `_` is `testcases - 1`, and the return value of `func_6()` has been returned `testcases` times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Executes a loop of `func_6()` a number of times equal to the return value of `func_3()`, without modifying the input variables or returning any value.
