The only variable in the loop head is `f`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `f`. If there are more values in `F`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `f` has taken on one value from `F`. For the loop to execute again, `f` must take on the next value in `F`.

State: **`l` is either equal to `h` or greater than `h - 1`, `h` is either equal to `l` or less than `l + 1`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`, `f` is the next value in `F`**
