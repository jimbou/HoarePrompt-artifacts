Output State: **`l` is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, `l` is greater than or equal to `h`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, and `f` is the next value in F. The current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `h`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the relationship between `l` and `h` is still maintained.
