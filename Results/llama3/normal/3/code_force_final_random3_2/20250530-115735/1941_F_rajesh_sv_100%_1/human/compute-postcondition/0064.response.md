Output State: **l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, h is the average of l and h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f.**

In this output state, the value of h has been updated to be equal to mid, which is the average of l and h. The other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between l and h is still valid, with l being less than mid and h being greater than l + 1. The values of mid, mid_sum, and mid_next_sum also remain the same.
