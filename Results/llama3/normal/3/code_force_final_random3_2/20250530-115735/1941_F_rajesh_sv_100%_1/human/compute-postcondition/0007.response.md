Output State: **`testcases` is the return value of `func_3()`, `_` is `testcases - 1`, and the return value of `func_6()` has been returned `testcases` times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `testcases` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_3()`. The loop variable `_` will have incremented `testcases - 1` times, ending at `testcases - 1`. The function `func_6()` will have been called and its return value will have been returned `testcases` times.
