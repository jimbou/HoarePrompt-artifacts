This function takes a delimiter string as input and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by first obtaining a string from an external function (func_2()), then splitting this string into substrings based on the provided delimiter, and finally converting each substring into an integer. The function's purpose is to parse a string into a list of integers, with the delimiter determining how the string is segmented. Upon conclusion, the function provides a list of integers as output, with the original input string and delimiter having been processed but not altered.
