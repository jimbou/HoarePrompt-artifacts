Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct integers, F is a list of k integers, i is n, diff is A[n - 1] - A[n - 2], max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is A[index - 1], right is A[index], and ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A.
Code of the loop:
for f in F:
    l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
    h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
    while l < h:
        mid = l + (h - l) // 2
        mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
        if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            h = mid
    if l == h:
        ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *l is either equal to h or greater than h - 1, h is either equal to l or less than l + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If l is equal to h, ans is the minimum of its previous value and max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, l is greater than or equal to h, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f, and ans is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f if l is equal to h. Otherwise, the values of l, h, mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum, and ans remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *l is equal to h, l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1, mid, mid_sum, mid_next_sum remain unchanged, ans is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of D[l] + f - left and right - D[l] - f.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
