Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `A` is a list of `n` distinct integers in ascending order, `D` is a sorted list of `m` distinct integers, `F` is a list of `k` integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `n`, `diff` is `A[n - 1] - A[n - 2]`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the maximum difference in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `f` is the first element in the list `F`, `l` is the insertion point for `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order and `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is the average of `l` and `h`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the average of `l` and `h`, and (`mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`).**

In this output state, the value of `h` has been updated to be the average of `l` and `h`, which is the same as its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
