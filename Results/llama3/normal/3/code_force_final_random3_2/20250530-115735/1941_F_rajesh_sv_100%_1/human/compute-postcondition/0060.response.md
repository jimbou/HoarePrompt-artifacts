Postcondition: ***l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, h is the insertion point of right - f in D to maintain sorted order minus 1 and h is greater than mid + 1, mid is the average of l and h, mid_sum is D[mid] + f, and mid_next_sum is D[mid + 1] + f. If mid_sum - left is less than right - mid_next_sum, then l is the average of the original l and h plus 1, otherwise l is the insertion point of left - f in D to maintain sorted order and l is less than mid, and h is the average of l and h.***
