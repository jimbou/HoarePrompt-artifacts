To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `l < h`. The variables involved in this condition are `l` and `h`.

Given the states:
- `l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order.
- `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l < h` must be true. This means we need to ensure that `l` is indeed less than `h`.

Since `l` and `h` are both insertion points in a sorted order, and `h` is defined as one less than the insertion point of `right - f`, we can infer that for `l` to be less than `h`, the insertion point of `left - f` must be less than the insertion point of `right - f` minus 1.

However, without specific values or relationships between `left`, `right`, and `f`, we cannot directly adjust `l` and `h` to ensure `l < h`. But we can infer that for the loop to execute, the relationship between `left`, `right`, and `f` must be such that the insertion points satisfy `l < h`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is not in the values of `l` and `h` themselves but in ensuring that the condition that leads to `l < h` is met. This means the relationship between `left`, `right`, and `f` must be such that when `l` and `h` are calculated, `l` is indeed less than `h`.

State: **`l` is the insertion point of `left - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order, `h` is the insertion point of `right - f` in `D` to maintain sorted order minus 1, and the relationship between `left`, `right`, and `f` must ensure `l < h`**
