The only variable in the loop head is variable f, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable f.  If f & f - 1 != 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, f is k minus q minus 2 to the power of p-1 and must not be a power of 2. For the loop to be executed one more time f must not be a power of 2.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m and must be such that k - q is not a power of 2, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l is a string of binary digits representing f, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1, f is k minus q minus 2 to the power of p-1 and must not be a power of 2**
