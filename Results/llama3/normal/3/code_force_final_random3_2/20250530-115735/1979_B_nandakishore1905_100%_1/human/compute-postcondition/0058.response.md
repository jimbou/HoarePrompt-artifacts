Output State: **i equals the number of test cases, stdin is empty, n and m are the last test case integers, k is the absolute difference between n and m, and the output is a sequence of numbers, each of which is either the absolute difference between two test case integers if it is a power of 2, 1 if the absolute difference is odd, or a power of 2 if the absolute difference is even but not a power of 2.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the number of test cases. The input buffer `stdin` will be empty because all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `m` will hold the values of the last test case. The variable `k` will hold the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The output will be a sequence of numbers, where each number corresponds to the result of processing a test case. If the absolute difference between the integers in a test case is a power of 2, the number itself is printed. If the absolute difference is odd, the number 1 is printed. If the absolute difference is even but not a power of 2, a power of 2 is printed.
