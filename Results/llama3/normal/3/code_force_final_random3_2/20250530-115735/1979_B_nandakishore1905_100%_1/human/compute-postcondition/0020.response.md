Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and k is not a power of 2. If k is odd, 1 is printed. Otherwise, a power of 2, f, is printed, where f is represented as a string of binary digits, l, with p digits, and q is 2 to the power of p-1.***
