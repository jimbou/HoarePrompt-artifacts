Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated non-negative integers x and y, where x is not equal to y. The number of test cases is specified by an integer t in the first line of stdin, where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif k % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        f = k - q
        while f & f - 1 != 0:
            l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = f - q
        print(f)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If k is a power of 2, the value of k is printed. If k is not a power of 2, if k is odd, 1 is printed. Otherwise, a power of 2, f, is printed, where f is represented as a string of binary digits, l, with p digits, and q is 2 to the power of p-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the absolute difference between n and m is a power of 2, the absolute difference between n and m is being printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n and m is odd, the number 1 is being printed. If the absolute difference between n and m is even but not a power of 2, the value of f which is a power of 2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the absolute difference between n and m (k) is a power of 2, the absolute difference between n and m is printed. If k is not a power of 2, 1 is printed if k is odd, otherwise 0 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
