The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
