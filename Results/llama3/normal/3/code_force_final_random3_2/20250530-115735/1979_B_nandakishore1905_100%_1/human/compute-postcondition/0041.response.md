Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and m. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by two. Then, it calculates the absolute difference between n and m and assigns it to k. This value of k is a non-negative integer. The value of i remains unchanged at 2.
