Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the absolute difference between n and m is a power of 2, the absolute difference between n and m is being printed. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between n and m is odd, the number 1 is being printed. If the absolute difference between n and m is even but not a power of 2, the value of f which is a power of 2 is being printed.***
