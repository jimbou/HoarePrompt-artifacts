Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the values input from stdin, replacing their initial values. The value of `k` has been recalculated based on the new values of `n` and `m`, and is now equal to the absolute difference between the two. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. Stdin now contains one less test case than initially, as one test case has been read and processed.
