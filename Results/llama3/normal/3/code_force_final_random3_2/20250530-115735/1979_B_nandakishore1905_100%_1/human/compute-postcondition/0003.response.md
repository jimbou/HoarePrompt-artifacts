Based on the precondition, we know that `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and the current value of `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`).

Since `k` is a power of 2, it can be represented as `2^x` for some integer `x`. Therefore, the value of `k` is a power of 2.

When the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `k`, which is a power of 2.

Output: **a power of 2 (where the power of 2 is the absolute difference between n and m)**
