This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two space-separated non-negative integers. It calculates the absolute difference between these integers and prints a value based on whether this difference is a power of 2, odd, or an even number that is not a power of 2. If the difference is a power of 2, it prints the difference. If the difference is odd, it prints 1. If the difference is even but not a power of 2, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the difference. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, at which point the input is exhausted.
