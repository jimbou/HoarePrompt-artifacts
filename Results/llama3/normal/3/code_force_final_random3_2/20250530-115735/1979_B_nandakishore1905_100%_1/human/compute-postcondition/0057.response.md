Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If the absolute difference between n and m (k) is a power of 2, the absolute difference between n and m is printed. If k is not a power of 2, 1 is printed if k is odd, otherwise 0 is printed.***
