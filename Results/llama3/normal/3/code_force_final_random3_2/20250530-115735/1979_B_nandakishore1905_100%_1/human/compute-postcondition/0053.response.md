Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i is 2, l is a string of binary digits representing f, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1, f is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that n and m remain integers, k remains a non-negative integer equal to the absolute difference between n and m, i remains 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. The loop variables l, p, q, and f have changed. l is a string of binary digits representing f, p is the number of digits in l, q is 2 to the power of p-1, and f is 0.
