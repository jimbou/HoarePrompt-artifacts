Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is either 30 or 31, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1', and the elements of s are being printed. If the current value of s[i] is '-1' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1], and the length of s which is either 30 or 31 is being printed, and the elements of s which are either '1', '0', or '-1' are being printed**
