Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1' or '0', `flag` is 0. The list `s` containing 30 strings, each either '1' or '0' has been printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is less than 29, length is 30, x is an integer, and flag is either 0 or 1. s is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 0 and the value at index i in list s is equal to the value at index i + 1 and the value at index i in list s is '1', then the value at index i in list s is '-1' and the value at index i+1 in list s is '1', and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then the value at index i in list s is '0'. If flag is not 1, then either flag is not zero, or the value at index i in list s is not equal to the value at index i + 1, or the value at index i in list s is not '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `flag` is either 0 or 1. `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 0 and the string at index `i` in `s` is '1' and the string at index `i+1` in `s` is '1', then the string at index `i` in `s` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and the string at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0 and the string at index `i` in `s` is set to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and the string at index `i` in `s` is not '0', then the string at index `i` in `s` is set to '0'. If `flag` is 0 and the string at index `i` in `s` is not '1' or the string at index `i+1` in `s` is not '1', then no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 29, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `flag` is either 0 or 1. `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 0 and the string at index `i` in `s` is '1' and the string at index `i` in `s` is the same as the string at index `i+1` in `s`, then the string at index `i` in `s` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` is 1 and the string at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0 and the string at index `i` in `s` is set to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and the string at index `i` in `s` is not '0', then the string at index `i` in `s` is set to '0'. If none of the above conditions are met, then the values of `t`, `nalla`, `i`, `length`, `x`, `flag`, and `s` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
