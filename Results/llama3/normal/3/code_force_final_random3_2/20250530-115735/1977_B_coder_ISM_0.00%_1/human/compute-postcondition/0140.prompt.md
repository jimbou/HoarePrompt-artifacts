Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is 29, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1', and the elements of s are being printed. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then s[29] is '1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 0 or s[29] is '1', then either length is 30, or length is 31 and flag is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is 1, length is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1', and the elements of s are being printed. If the current value of s[i] is '-1' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is 2, length is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 2, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If the current value of s[i] is '-1' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 3, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 3, `x` is an integer from stdin, and `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If the current value of `s[i]` is '-1' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the current value of `s[i]` is '0' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
