Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is less than 31, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is True, then `s` is a list containing '1' and '0'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing '0' and '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending '0' to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `s` is still dependent on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i`, but now it has an additional '0' appended to its list.
