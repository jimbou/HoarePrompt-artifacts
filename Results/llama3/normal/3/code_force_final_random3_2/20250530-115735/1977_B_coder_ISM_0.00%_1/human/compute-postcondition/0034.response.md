The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 29, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0 and less than 29. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is at least 1 and less than 30**
