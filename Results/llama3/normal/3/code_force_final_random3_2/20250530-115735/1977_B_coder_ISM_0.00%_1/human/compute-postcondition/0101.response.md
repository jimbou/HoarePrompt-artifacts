Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is less than 29, length is 30, x is an integer from stdin, s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of s are being printed. The current value of flag is 1. s[i] is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of s at index i is now '0'. All other variables remain unchanged, including t, nalla, i, length, x, and the elements of s (except for s[i]). The flag is still 1.
