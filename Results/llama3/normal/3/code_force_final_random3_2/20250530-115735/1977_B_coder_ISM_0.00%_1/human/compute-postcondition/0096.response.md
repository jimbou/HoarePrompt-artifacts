Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is less than 29, length is 30, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of s are being printed. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then flag is set to 0 and s[i] is '1'.***
