Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 3, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be greater than 3, `x` is an integer from stdin, and `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1'. If the current value of `s[i]` is '-1' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '1', then the current value of `s[i]` is '0' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]`.***
