Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is less than 31, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is True, then `s` is a list containing '1' and '1'. Otherwise, if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is False, then `s` is a list containing '0' and '0'.***
