Output: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1' or '0'. The value of each string in `s` is determined by the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number. The list `s` containing 30 strings, each either '1' or '0' is being printed**
