Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is 30, length is 30, flag is 0, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of s are being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is less than 29, length is 30, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of s are being printed. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then flag is set to 0 and s[i] is '1'. Otherwise, either flag is 0, or s[i] is '1', or s[i] is equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is '1'. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then s[i] is '-1' and flag is 1 and s[i + 1] is '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer from stdin, and `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of `s` are being printed. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and both are '1', then the ith element of `s` is '-1' and `flag` is 1. If `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is '0' regardless of the previous value of `s[i]`. If `flag` is not 1 and `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is '1' and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `flag`, `s[i]`, and `s[i + 1]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is less than 30 and greater than the current value, length is 30, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then the ith element of s is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1, then the i-th element of s is '0' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, the values of flag and s[i] remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
