To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the implicit upper limit of the range (30 in this case).

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than 30. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than 30. To execute the loop again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is less than 31, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1. `x` is an integer from stdin. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is True, then `s` is a list containing '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing '0'.**
