Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 29, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `flag` is either 0 or 1. `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and the string at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `flag` is set to 0 and the string at index `i` in `s` is set to '1'. If `flag` is 1 and the string at index `i` in `s` is not '0', then the string at index `i` in `s` is set to '0'. If `flag` is 0, then the values of `t`, `nalla`, `i`, `length`, `x`, `flag`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
