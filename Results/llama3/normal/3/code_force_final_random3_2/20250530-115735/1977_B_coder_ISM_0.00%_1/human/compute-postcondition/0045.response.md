Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, length is 30, i is at least 2 and less than 30, s[i] is '-1', flag is 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s[i]` and `flag`. The first line assigns the value '-1' to `s[i]`, regardless of its previous value. The second line sets `flag` to 1. The values of `t`, `nalla`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
