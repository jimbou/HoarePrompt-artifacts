Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer from stdin, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of `s` are being printed. `s[i]` is '0' regardless of the previous value of `s[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s[i]` is now '0', regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still contains 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', and these elements are being printed. The values of `t`, `nalla`, `i`, `length`, and `x` are unchanged.
