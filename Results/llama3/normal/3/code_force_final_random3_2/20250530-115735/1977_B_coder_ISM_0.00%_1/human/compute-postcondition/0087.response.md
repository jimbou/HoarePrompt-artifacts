Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 31, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin, `s` is a list containing either '1', '1', '0' or '0', '0', '0' depending on the value of the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include an additional '0' at the end of the list, regardless of the initial value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` now depends on the initial value of the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i`. If the bitwise AND was True, `s` now contains '1', '1', '0'. If the bitwise AND was False, `s` now contains '0', '0', '0'.
