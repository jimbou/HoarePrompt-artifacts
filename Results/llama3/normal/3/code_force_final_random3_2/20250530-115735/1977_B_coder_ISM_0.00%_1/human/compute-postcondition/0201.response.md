Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is 29, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer, and flag is either 0 or 1. s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 1 and the string at index 29 in s is '0', then the string at index 29 in s is set to '1' and flag is set to 0. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then the string at index 29 in s is '0', and the string at index 30 in s is '1'. If flag is 0, then the state of s remains unchanged.**
