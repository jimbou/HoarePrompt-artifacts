The code snippet provided modifies the values of `x`, `s`, and `length`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. Since `x` was an integer from stdin, it now takes the value of the input.
*   The second line assigns an empty list to `s`. This overwrites the previous value of `s`, which was a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element was either '1', '0', or '-1'.
*   The third line assigns the value 30 to `length`. This overwrites the previous value of `length`, which was either 30 or 31.

The values of `t`, `nalla`, and `i` are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is either 30 or 31, length is 30, x is an integer, and s is an empty list.**
