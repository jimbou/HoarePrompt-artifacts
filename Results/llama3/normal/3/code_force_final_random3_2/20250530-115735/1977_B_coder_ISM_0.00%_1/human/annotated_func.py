If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1]. The length of the list s which is either 30 or 31 is being printed, and the list s is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a single positive integer x. For each test case, it converts the integer into a binary string, applies a series of transformations to the binary string (including flipping bits and adding a new bit if necessary), and then prints the length of the transformed binary string and the string itself.
