Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is 29, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer, and flag is either 0 or 1. s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 1 and the string at index 29 in s is '0', then the string at index 29 in s is set to '1' and flag is set to 0. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then the string at index 29 in s is '0', and the string at index 30 in s is '1'. If flag is 0, then the state of s remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is 1, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then the current value of s[i] is '0' and the current value of s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is 2, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1], and the list s remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 3, `length` is either 30 or 31, `x` is an integer, `flag` is either 0 or 1, and `s` is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings. If the 3rd element of `s` is '-1' and the 2nd element is '1', then the 3rd element of `s` is '0' and the 2nd element is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
