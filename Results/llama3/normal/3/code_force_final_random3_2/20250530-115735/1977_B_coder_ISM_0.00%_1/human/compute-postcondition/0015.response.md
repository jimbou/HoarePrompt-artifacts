Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0, and an additional '0' is appended at the end of the list `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is still 0, `length` is still 30, and `i` is still 2. The list `s` still contains either '1' or '0' based on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i`, but now it has an additional '0' appended to the end.
