Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is 1, `length` is either 30 or 31 and must be at least 2, `x` is an integer from stdin, and `s` is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1', and the elements of `s` are being printed. The current value of `s[i]` is '-1' and the current value of `s[i - 1]` is '1'.**
