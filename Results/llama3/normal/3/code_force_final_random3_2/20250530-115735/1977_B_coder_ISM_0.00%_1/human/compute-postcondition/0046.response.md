Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is at least 2 and less than 30, `s[i]` is '0'. If `flag` is true, then `flag` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `s[i]` has been changed to '0'. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `flag` and `s[i]` is no longer applicable because `s[i]` is now '0'. If `flag` was true, it is now 0.
