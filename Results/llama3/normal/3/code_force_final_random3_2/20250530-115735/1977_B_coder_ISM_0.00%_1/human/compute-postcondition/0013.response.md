The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 30, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, '1' is appended at the end of the list `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to the end of `s`.**
