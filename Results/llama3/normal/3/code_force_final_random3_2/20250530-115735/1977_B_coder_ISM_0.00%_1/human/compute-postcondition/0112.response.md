Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer from stdin, and `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of `s` are being printed. If `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is '0' regardless of the previous value of `s[i]`. If `flag` is not 1, then if `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', `s[i]` is '1' and `flag` is 0. Otherwise, the values of `flag`, `s[i]`, and `s[i + 1]` remain unchanged.***
