Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0, and '1' is appended at the end of the list `s`.**

In this output state, the list `s` has been modified by appending the string '1' at the end. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains an additional element '1' at the end, while the rest of the elements are determined by the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 to the power of `i`.
