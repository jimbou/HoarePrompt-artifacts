Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 31, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is True, then `s` is a list containing '1', '1', and '1'. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is False, then `s` is a list containing either '0', '0', and '0' or '0', '0', and '1'.***
