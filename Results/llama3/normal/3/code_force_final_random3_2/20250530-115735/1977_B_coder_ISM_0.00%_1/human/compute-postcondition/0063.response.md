Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, i is 2, s[i] is '0', s[i - 1] is '-1', flag is 1, and length is 30.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `nalla`, `i`, `flag`, and `length` remain unchanged from the initial state. The values of `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` are updated according to the code snippet. Since `s[i]` is assigned the value '0' and `s[i - 1]` is assigned the value '-1', these changes are reflected in the output state.
