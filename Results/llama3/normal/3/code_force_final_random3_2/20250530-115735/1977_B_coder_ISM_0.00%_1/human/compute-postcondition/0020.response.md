Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 29, `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, '1' is appended at the end of the list `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to the end of `s`. and the list `s` is printed, `flag` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` remains 0, `length` is still 30, and `i` is still 29. The list `s` still contains either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i`. Additionally, a new variable `flag` is introduced and assigned the value 0.
