Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is at least 0 and less than 29, `flag` is 0. `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0, except if `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is '1'. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
