Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is 30, length is 30, flag is 0, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of s are being printed.**

In this output state, the value of flag has been changed to 0, while the values of other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The variable t is still a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is still 1, i is still 30, length is still 30, x is still an integer from stdin, and s is still a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of s are still being printed.
