Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, and `s` contains either the string '0' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true), or the string '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0, except if `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` and `s[i]` is '1', then `flag` is 1, `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i + 1]` is '1'. Otherwise, if `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is '0' regardless of the value of `x` and `flag`. Additionally, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1' is still valid but if `flag` is 1 then `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]` is now definitely true. If `flag` is 0, then `s` remains unchanged. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0' and `s[30]` is '1'. Otherwise, `length` is 30.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` remains 0, `i` is now 30, `length` remains 30, and `flag` remains 1. The string `s` contains either '0' or '1' depending on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i`, except when `flag` is 1 and `s[i]` is '0', in which case `s[i]` is '1'. If `flag` is 0, `s` remains unchanged. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` is 31, `s[29]` is '0', and `s[30]` is '1'. Otherwise, `length` is 30.
