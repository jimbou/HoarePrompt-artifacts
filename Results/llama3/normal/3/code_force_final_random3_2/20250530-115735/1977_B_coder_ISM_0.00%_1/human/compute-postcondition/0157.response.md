The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than 30, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 31, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 32, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' followed by either '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, then '1' is appended to `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to `s`.**
