Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1' or '0'. The value of each string in `s` is determined by the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all 30 iterations, the output state is such that `t` remains a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` remains 2, `i` reaches 30, and `length` remains 30. The variable `x` remains an integer, and the list `s` is populated with 30 strings, each being either '1' or '0'. The value of each string in `s` is determined by the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number.
