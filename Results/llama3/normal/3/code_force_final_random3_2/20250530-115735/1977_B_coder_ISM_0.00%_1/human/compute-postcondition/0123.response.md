Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is 29, length is 30, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of s are being printed. The current value of flag is 1 and the current value of s[29] is '0'.**
