Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is less than 29, length is 30, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, and the elements of s are being printed. The current value of flag is 1. If s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1'. Additionally, either s[i] is not equal to s[i + 1], or s[i] is not '1'.**
