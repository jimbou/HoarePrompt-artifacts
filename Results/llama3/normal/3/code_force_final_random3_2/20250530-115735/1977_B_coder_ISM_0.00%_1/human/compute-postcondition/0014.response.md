Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, '1' is appended at the end of the list `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to the end of `s`. Additionally, '1' is appended at the end of the list `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is still 0, and `length` is still 30. The value of `i` is still 2. The list `s` now contains an additional '1' at the end, indicating that the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true).
