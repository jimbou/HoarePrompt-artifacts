The `print(*s)` statement will print the elements of the list `s` as separate values, without any separators or quotes.

The list `s` contains 30 strings, each either '1' or '0', determined by the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't determine the exact values of the strings in `s`. However, we can describe the output as a sequence of 30 binary digits ('1's and '0's), representing the results of the bitwise AND operations.

Output: **a sequence of 30 binary digits ('1's and '0's), representing the results of the bitwise AND operations between x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number**
