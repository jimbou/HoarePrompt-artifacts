Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 31, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1, `x` is an integer from stdin. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is True, then `s` is a list containing '1', '1', and '1'. Otherwise, if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is False, then `s` is a list containing '0', '0', and '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by appending '1' to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `s` is still dependent on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i`, but now it has an additional '1' appended to its original value.
