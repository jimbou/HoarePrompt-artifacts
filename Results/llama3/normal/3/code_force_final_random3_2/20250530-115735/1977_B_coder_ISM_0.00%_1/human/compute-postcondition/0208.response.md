Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is 2, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer, flag is either 0 or 1, and s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings. If s[i] is '-1' and s[i - 1] is '1', then s[i] is '0' and s[i - 1] is '-1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to s[i] and s[i - 1], and the list s remains unchanged.**
