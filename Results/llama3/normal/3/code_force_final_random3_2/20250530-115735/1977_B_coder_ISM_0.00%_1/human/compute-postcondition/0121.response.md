Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is less than 30 and greater than the current value, length is 30, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of x and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number. If flag is 0 and s[i] is equal to s[i + 1] and s[i] is '1', then the ith element of s is '-1' and flag is 1. If flag is 1, then the i-th element of s is '0' and flag is 0. If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', then s[i] is '1' and flag is 0. Otherwise, the values of flag and s[i] remain unchanged.***
