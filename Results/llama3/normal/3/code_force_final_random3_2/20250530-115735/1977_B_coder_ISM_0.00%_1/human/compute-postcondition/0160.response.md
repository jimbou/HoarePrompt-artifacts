Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 32, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' followed by either '1' or '0' and then either '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, then '1' is appended to `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to `s`.***
