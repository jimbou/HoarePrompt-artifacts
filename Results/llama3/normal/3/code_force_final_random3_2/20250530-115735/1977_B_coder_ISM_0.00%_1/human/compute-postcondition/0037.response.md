Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, nalla is 0, length is 30, i is at least 1 and less than 30, s[i] is '-1', flag is 1.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `nalla`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. The value of `s[i]` is updated to '-1' as per the first line of the code. The value of `flag` is set to 1 as per the second line of the code.
