Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is 30, length is 30, flag is 1, s is an empty list, and x is an integer from stdin. Stdin is empty.**

The code snippet provided reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable x. The length of the string s is set to 30. The value of flag is not modified by the code, so it remains 1. The string s is reinitialized as an empty list. The value of i is not modified by the code, so it remains 30. The value of nalla is not modified by the code, so it remains 1. The value of t is not modified by the code, so it remains a positive integer greater than 1.
