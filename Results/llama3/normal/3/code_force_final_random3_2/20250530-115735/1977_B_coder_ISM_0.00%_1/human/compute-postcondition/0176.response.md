Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is less than 29, length is 30, x is an integer, s is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1' or '0'. If flag is 1, then the value at index i in list s is '0'. If flag is not 1, then either flag is not zero, or the value at index i in list s is not equal to the value at index i + 1, or the value at index i in list s is not '1'.***
