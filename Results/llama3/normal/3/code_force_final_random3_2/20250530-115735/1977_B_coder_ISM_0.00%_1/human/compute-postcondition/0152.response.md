Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, and `x` is an integer. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is not zero, then `s` is a list containing the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the string '0'.***
