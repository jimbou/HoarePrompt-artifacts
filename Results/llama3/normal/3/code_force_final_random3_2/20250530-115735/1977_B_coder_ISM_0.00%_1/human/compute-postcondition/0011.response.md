Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 1, `s` contains either the string '1' if the current value of `x` has a bit set at position `i` (i.e., `x` & `2^i` is true), or the string '0' if the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is 0, and an additional '0' is appended to the end of `s`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `nalla`, `length`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `s` is updated by appending an additional '0' to its end, while still maintaining its original property of containing '1' or '0' based on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 to the power of `i`.
