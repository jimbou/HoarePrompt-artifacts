Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 32, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' followed by either '1' or '0' and then '1'. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, then '1' is appended to `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to `s` before the last '1' was appended.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `nalla`, `i`, `length`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `s` has an additional element '1' appended to it, regardless of the previous condition. The condition regarding the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 to the power of `i` still holds for the elements before the last '1' was appended.
