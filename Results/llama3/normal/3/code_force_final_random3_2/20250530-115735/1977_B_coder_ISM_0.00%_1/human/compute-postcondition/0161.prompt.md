Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is either 30 or 31, length is 30, x is an integer, and s is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(30):
    if x & pow(2, i):
        s.append('1')
    else:
        s.append('0')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, and `x` is an integer. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is not zero, then `s` is a list containing the string '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing the string '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 31, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' followed by either '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, then '1' is appended to `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `nalla` is 2, `i` is less than 32, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing either the string '1' or '0' followed by either '1' or '0' and then either '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and 2 to the power of `i` is true, then '1' is appended to `s`. Otherwise, '0' is appended to `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
