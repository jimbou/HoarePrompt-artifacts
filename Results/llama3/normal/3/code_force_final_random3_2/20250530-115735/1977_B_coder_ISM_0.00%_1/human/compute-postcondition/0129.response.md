Postcondition: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, nalla is 1, i is 29, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer from stdin, and s is a list of either 30 or 31 elements where each element is either '1', '0', or '-1', and the elements of s are being printed. If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', then s[29] is '1' and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 0 or s[29] is '1', then either length is 30, or length is 31 and flag is 1.**
