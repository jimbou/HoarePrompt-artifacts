Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is less than 30, `length` is 30, `flag` is 1. `x` is an integer from stdin. If the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is True, then `s` is a list containing '1'. Otherwise, `s` is a list containing '0'.***
