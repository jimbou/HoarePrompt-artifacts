Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is 1, `i` is less than 30 and greater than the current value, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer from stdin, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of the corresponding iteration number, except for the `i-th` element which is now '0', and `flag` is 0 if it was 1, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `nalla` is still 1, `i` is still less than 30 and greater than the current value, and `length` is still 30. The value of `x` is still an integer from stdin. The list `s` still has 30 elements, but the `i-th` element is now '0', regardless of its previous value. The value of `flag` is 0 if it was previously 1, otherwise it remains unchanged.
