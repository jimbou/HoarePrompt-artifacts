Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is 29, length is either 30 or 31, x is an integer, and flag is either 0 or 1. s is a list containing either 30 or 31 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 1, then the string at index 29 in s is '0', and the string at index 30 in s is '1'. Otherwise, the state of s remains unchanged.***
