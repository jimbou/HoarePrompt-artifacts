Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer greater than 2, nalla is 2, i is less than 29, length is 30, x is an integer, and flag is either 0 or 1. s is a list containing 30 strings, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If flag is 0 and the value at index i in list s is equal to the value at index i + 1 and the value at index i in list s is '1', then the value at index i in list s is '-1' and the value at index i+1 in list s is '1', and flag is 1. Otherwise, if flag is 1, then the value at index i in list s is '0'. If flag is not 1, then either flag is not zero, or the value at index i in list s is not equal to the value at index i + 1, or the value at index i in list s is not '1'.***
