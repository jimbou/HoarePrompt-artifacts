Output State: **mex is a list containing 0, minn is 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, i is 0, maxx is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the list `mex` now contains the value 0, which was the initial value of `minn`. The value of `minn` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `arr`, `i`, `maxx`, and the contents of `stdin`.
