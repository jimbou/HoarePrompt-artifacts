Output State: **`mex` contains either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `minn` is either 2, 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between `-n` and `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to be either 2, 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, which is one more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
