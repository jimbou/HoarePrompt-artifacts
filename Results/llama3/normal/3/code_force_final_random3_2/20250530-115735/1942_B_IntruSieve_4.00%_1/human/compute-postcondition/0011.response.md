Postcondition: ***`mex` contains the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between -n and n, `minn` is 0, and stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to be equal to this absolute difference. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.***
