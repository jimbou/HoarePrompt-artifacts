Output State: **mex contains either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 1 or 3, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n.**

The code snippet modifies the state of the variables `mex` and `minn`. The first line appends the current value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Since `minn` is either 0 or 2, `mex` will contain either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`. The second line increments `minn` by 1, making it either 1 or 3. The values of `maxx`, `i`, `stdin`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
