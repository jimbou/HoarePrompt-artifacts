You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to i, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is equal to n, stdin contains t-n test cases. If arr[i] > 0, then the last element of mex is equal to the previous value of minn, and minn is one more than its previous value. If minn is equal to maxx, then minn is one more than maxx. If arr[i] <= 0, then if the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn is greater than maxx, then maxx is updated to the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop has executed for all elements in the mex list, printing each element in the list. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
    print()
    #This is printed: a blank line

```

Return Postconditions: The loop has executed for all elements in the mex list, printing each element in the list. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
