Postcondition: **`mex` contains the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between -n and n, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, and stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of `mex` is greater than the current value of `maxx`.**
