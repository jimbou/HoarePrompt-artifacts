To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itm` and `mex`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex` list. If the `mex` list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `i`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, and must have at least 1 element, `minn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `t-n` test cases, `itm` is the first element in the `mex` list**
