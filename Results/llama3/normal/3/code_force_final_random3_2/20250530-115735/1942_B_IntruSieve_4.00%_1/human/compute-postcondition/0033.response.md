The only object in the loop head is variable  itm and list mex, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the mex list.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, mex has at least 1 element, itm is the first element in the list mex. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the itm is the second element in the list mex.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `i`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, and must have at least 2 elements, `minn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `t-n` test cases, `itm` is the second element in the `mex` list, and the second element of the `mex` list which is `itm` is being printed**
