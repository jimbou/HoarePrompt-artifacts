Output State: **`mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `minn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, `maxx` is the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is either 2 or 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `maxx` has been updated to be the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `mex` still contains either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`. The integer `n` is still between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 2. The list `arr` still contains `n` integers between -`n` and `n`. The value of `minn` is still either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1. The index `i` is still either 2 or 3. There are still t-2 test cases in the stdin.
