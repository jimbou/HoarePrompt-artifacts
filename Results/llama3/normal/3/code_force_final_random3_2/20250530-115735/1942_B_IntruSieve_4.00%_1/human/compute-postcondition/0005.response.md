Output State: **`mex` is a list containing 0, `minn` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `i` is 0, `maxx` is 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. The current value of `minn` is not equal to the current value of `maxx`.**

In this output state, the value of `minn` has been updated to 2, which is one more than the current value of `maxx`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `minn` is equal to the current value of `maxx` is no longer true.
