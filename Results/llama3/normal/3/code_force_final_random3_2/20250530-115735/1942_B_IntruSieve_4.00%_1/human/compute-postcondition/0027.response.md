Postcondition: ***`mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `minn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is either 2 or 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`.***
