Output State: **The loop has executed for all elements in the mex list, printing each element in the list. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has iterated over all elements in the mex list, printing each element in the list. After printing the last element, the loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated. The values of the other variables in the precondition, such as n, arr, minn, maxx, i, and stdin, remain unchanged.
