Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, and the last element of mex is equal to the previous value of minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, and is one more than its previous value, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is either 2 or 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `arr` remains unchanged. The list `mex` has been appended with the previous value of `minn`. The value of `minn` has been incremented by 1. The value of `maxx` remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1.
