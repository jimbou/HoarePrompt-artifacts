Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to i, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is equal to n, stdin contains t-n test cases. If arr[i] > 0, then the last element of mex is equal to the previous value of minn, and minn is one more than its previous value. If minn is equal to maxx, then minn is one more than maxx. If arr[i] <= 0, then if the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn is greater than maxx, then maxx is updated to the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire array `arr`, and the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` have been updated accordingly. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The state of the other variables, such as `stdin` and `t`, remains unchanged.
