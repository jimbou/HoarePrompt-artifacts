Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation p based on an array a. The program uses a list `mex` to store the constructed permutation, and two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

The program iterates through the input array `arr`, and for each element, it checks if the element is positive or non-positive. If the element is positive, it appends the current minimum value `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it updates `minn` to be `maxx + 1`. If the element is non-positive, it appends the absolute difference between the absolute value of the element and the current minimum value `minn` to the `mex` list, and updates `maxx` if necessary.

The program then prints each element of the `mex` list followed by a space, and finally prints a blank line.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly constructs the permutation p based on the array a, and handles the cases where the input elements are positive or non-positive.

Correctness: **True**
