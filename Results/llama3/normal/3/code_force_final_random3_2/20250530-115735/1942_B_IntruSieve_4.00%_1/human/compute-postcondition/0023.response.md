Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, and the last element of `mex` is equal to the previous value of `minn`, `minn` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, and is one more than its previous value, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `minn` is one more than `maxx`, stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `minn` is updated to be one more than the value of `maxx`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `maxx`, and `i` remain the same. The value of `minn` is now dependent on the value of `maxx`. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases.
