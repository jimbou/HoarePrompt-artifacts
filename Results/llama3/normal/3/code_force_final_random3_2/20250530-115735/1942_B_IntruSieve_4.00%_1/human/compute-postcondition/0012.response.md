Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0 or 2, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is 0. If arr[i] > 0, then mex contains 0, minn is 2, and maxx is 1. If arr[i] <= 0, then mex contains the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, and maxx is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn. In all cases, the current value of minn is not equal to the current value of maxx.***
