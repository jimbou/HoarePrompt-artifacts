The code prints the first element of the `mex` list, which is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, followed by a space.
Output: **the first element of the mex list (which is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn), followed by a space**
