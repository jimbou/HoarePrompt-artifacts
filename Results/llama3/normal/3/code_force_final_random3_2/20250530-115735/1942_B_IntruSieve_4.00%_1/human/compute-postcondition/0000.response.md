Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the state of the program is as follows: the standard input (stdin) now contains t-1 test cases, as one test case has been read. The variable n holds an integer value between 1 and 2 * 10^5, which is the number of integers in the current test case. The variable arr is a list of n integers, each between -n and n, which are the input values for the current test case. The variable mex is an empty list, initialized but not populated. The variables minn and maxx are both initialized to 0, but their values have not been updated yet.
