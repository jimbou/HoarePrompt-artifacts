The code prints the second element of the `mex` list, which is `itm`. Since `itm` is the second element of the `mex` list, its value is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`. However, since `i` is equal to `n`, which means we have reached the end of the `arr` list, the value of `itm` is not dependent on the current element of `arr` at index `i`. Therefore, the value of `itm` is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the last element of `arr` and `minn`. 

Output: **the second element of the mex list (which is either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the last element of arr and minn)**
