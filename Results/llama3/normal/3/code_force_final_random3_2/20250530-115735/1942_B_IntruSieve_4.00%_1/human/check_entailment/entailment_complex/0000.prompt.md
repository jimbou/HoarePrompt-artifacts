Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[MOOO! - Doja Cat](https://soundcloud.com/amalaofficial/mooo)

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to i, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is equal to n, stdin contains t-n test cases. If arr[i] > 0, then the last element of mex is equal to the previous value of minn, and minn is one more than its previous value. If minn is equal to maxx, then minn is one more than maxx. If arr[i] <= 0, then if the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn is greater than maxx, then maxx is updated to the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop has executed for all elements in the mex list, printing each element in the list. The loop has finished executing, and the program has terminated.
    print()
    #This is printed: a blank line

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer n and a list of n integers from standard input, then prints a list of integers to standard output. The output list is generated based on the input list, where each element is either the current minimum value (minn) if the corresponding input element is positive, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the input element and the current minimum value (minn) if the input element is non-positive. The function also updates the minimum value (minn) and maximum value (maxx) based on the input elements. The function prints each element of the output list followed by a space, and finally prints a blank line.
