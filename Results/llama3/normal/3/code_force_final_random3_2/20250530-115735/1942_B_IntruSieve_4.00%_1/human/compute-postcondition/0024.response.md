Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, and the last element of mex is equal to the previous value of minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, and is one more than its previous value, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is either 2 or 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If minn is equal to maxx, then minn is one more than maxx.***
