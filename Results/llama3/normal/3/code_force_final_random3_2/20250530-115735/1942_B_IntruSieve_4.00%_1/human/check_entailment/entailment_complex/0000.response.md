Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values of the permutation, respectively. It iterates through the array `a` and for each element, it calculates the corresponding element in the permutation `p` based on the given formula. If the element in `a` is positive, it sets the corresponding element in `p` to the current minimum value `minn` and increments `minn`. If the element in `a` is non-positive, it sets the corresponding element in `p` to the absolute difference between the absolute value of the element in `a` and the current minimum value `minn`. It also updates `maxx` if the calculated value is greater than the current `maxx`.

The program then prints the constructed permutation `p` followed by a blank line.

Correctness: **True**
