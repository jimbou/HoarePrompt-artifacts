Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

The program then initializes two variables `minn` and `maxx` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

The program then iterates over the array `a` and for each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i] > 0`. If it is, it appends the current value of `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn` by 1. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, it sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`.

If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends the absolute difference between the absolute value of `arr[i]` and `minn` to the `mex` list. If this difference is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx` to this difference.

After iterating over the entire array `a`, the program prints the elements of the `mex` list, which represents the constructed permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
