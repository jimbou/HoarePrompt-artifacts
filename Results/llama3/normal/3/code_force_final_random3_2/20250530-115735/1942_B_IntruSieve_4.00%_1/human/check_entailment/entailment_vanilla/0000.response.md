Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses the concept of Minimum Excluded (MEX) to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes two variables, `minn` and `maxx`, to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation.
4. It iterates over the array `a` and for each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is greater than 0.
5. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it appends the current value of `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` again to ensure that `minn` is always greater than `maxx`.
6. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, it calculates the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` and appends it to the `mex` list. If this calculated value is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.
7. Finally, it prints the elements of the `mex` list, which represents the constructed permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the code:

* The function `func_1` is not necessary and can be removed. The code inside the function can be directly placed inside the loop that iterates over the test cases.
* The variable `mex` is not the most descriptive name. A better name would be `permutation` or `p`.
* The code uses `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation. However, `maxx` is not necessary, and the code can be simplified by removing it.

Correctness: **True**
