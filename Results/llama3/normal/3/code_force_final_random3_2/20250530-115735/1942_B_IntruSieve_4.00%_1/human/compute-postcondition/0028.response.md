Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is either 2 or 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If arr[i] > 0, then the last element of mex is equal to the previous value of minn, and minn is one more than its previous value. If minn is equal to maxx, then minn is one more than maxx. If arr[i] <= 0, then if the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn is greater than maxx, then maxx is updated to the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn.***
