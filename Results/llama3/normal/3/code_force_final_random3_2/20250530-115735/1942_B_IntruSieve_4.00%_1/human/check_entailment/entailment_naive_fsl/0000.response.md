Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation p based on the array a. The problem description states that a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i, where MEX is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. However, the program does not correctly calculate the MEX value.

For example, consider the input:

3
-2 1 2

The program will output:

2 0 1

However, this is not a valid permutation. The correct permutation should be:

2 0 1

But the program does not correctly calculate the MEX value for the third element. The MEX value for the third element should be 3, not 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
