Output State: **`mex` contains the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between -n and n, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is 0, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the list `mex` now contains a new element, which is the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`. The value of `i` remains 0, and the values of `n`, `arr`, `minn`, and `maxx` are unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
