Postcondition: **`stdin` contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between -n and n, `mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `minn` is either 0 or 2, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is 2. If `arr[i-1]` > 0, then the last element of `mex` is 0, `minn` is 2, and `maxx` is the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and 2. If `arr[i-1]` <= 0, then the last element of `mex` is the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i-1` and `minn`, and `maxx` is the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`. In all cases, the current value of `minn` is not equal to the current value of `maxx`. If the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to be the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`.**
