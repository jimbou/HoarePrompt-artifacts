Output State: **`mex` contains the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between -n and n, `minn` is 0, `maxx` is equal to the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `maxx` has been updated to be equal to the absolute difference between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, which is the same as the value of `mex`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
