This function reads an integer n and a list of n integers from standard input, then prints a list of integers to standard output. The output list is generated based on the input list, where each element is either the current minimum value (minn) if the corresponding input element is positive, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the input element and the current minimum value (minn) if the input element is non-positive. The function also updates the minimum value (minn) and maximum value (maxx) based on the input elements. The function prints each element of the output list followed by a space, and finally prints a blank line.
