The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is either 2 or 3. If arr[i] > 0, then mex contains either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn. If arr[i] <= 0, then mex contains either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0 or 2, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn. If the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn is greater than maxx, then maxx is updated to be the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn. In all cases, the current value of minn is not equal to the current value of maxx.**
