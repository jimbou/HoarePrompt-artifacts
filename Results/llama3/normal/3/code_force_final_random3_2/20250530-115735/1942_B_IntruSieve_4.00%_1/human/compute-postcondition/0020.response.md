Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is either 1 or 2. If arr[i] > 0, then mex contains either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn. If arr[i] <= 0, then mex contains either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0 or 2, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn. If the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn is greater than maxx, then maxx is updated to be the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn. In all cases, the current value of minn is not equal to the current value of maxx.***
