According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0, `i` is 0,  `n` must be greater than 0**
