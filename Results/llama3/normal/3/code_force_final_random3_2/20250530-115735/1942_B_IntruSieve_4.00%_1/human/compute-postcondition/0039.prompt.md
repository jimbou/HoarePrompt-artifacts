Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to i, arr is a list of n integers between -n and n, mex is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, minn is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn plus 1, maxx is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn, i is equal to n, stdin contains t-n test cases. If arr[i] > 0, then the last element of mex is equal to the previous value of minn, and minn is one more than its previous value. If minn is equal to maxx, then minn is one more than maxx. If arr[i] <= 0, then if the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn is greater than maxx, then maxx is updated to the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of arr at index i and minn.
Code of the loop:
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `i`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, and must have at least 1 element, `minn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `t-n` test cases, `itm` is the first element in the `mex` list, and the first element of the `mex` list which is `itm` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `i`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, and must have at least 2 elements, `minn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `t-n` test cases, `itm` is the second element in the `mex` list, and the second element of the `mex` list which is `itm` is being printed, and the value of `itm` which is the second element of the `mex` list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and greater than or equal to `i`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between -`n` and `n`, `mex` is a list containing either 0 or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, and must have at least 3 elements, `minn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn` plus 1, `maxx` is either 0, 1, or the absolute difference between the absolute value of the current element of `arr` at index `i` and `minn`, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `t-n` test cases, `itm` is the third element in the `mex` list, and the value of `itm` which is the third element of the `mex` list is being printed, and the value of `itm` which is the third element of the `mex` list is being printed, and this is printed: `[itm]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
