Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, i is 0, a, b, c are integers, k is 0, stdin contains no input. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of b divided by 3 and c is less than 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, k is set to a plus the integer division of b + c by 3, and if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, k is increased by 1, and the value of k is printed.***
