Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, k is 0, a, b, c are integers, stdin contains no input**

The code first assigns the values of three space-separated integers from stdin to a, b, and c. Since stdin contains no input, a, b, and c will be assigned the values of the three integers. The second line assigns 0 to k, which overwrites its previous value of 0, so k remains 0. The values of n and i are not affected by the code.
