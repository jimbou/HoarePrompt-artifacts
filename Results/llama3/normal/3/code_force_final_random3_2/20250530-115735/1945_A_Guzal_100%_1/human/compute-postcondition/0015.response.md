The code block consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of three space-separated integers from stdin to `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since stdin contains no input, this line will not execute successfully and will raise an error. The second line assigns the value 0 to `k`. 

However, since the first line will raise an error, the second line will not be executed. Therefore, the value of `k` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, k is 0, a, b, c are undefined, stdin contains no input.**
