Postcondition: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, k is 0, a, b, c are undefined, stdin contains no input. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if (b + c) % 3 != 0, an error will occur because k is undefined. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, and k is printed.**
