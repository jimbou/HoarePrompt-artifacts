This function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c. It then processes each set of a, b, and c, and prints a value based on the divisibility of b and the sum of b and c. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b modulo 3 and c is less than 3, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates a value k as the sum of a, the integer division of b plus c by 3, and an additional 1 if the remainder of the division is not 0, and prints this value. The function repeats this process t times, or not at all if t is 0.
