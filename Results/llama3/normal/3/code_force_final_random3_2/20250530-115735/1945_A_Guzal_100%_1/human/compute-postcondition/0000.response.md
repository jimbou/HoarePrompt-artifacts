The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the first line of the input and assigns it to `n`. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After accepting this integer, the first line is removed from the input, leaving the remaining `t` lines of input. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines of input, each containing three space-separated integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).**
