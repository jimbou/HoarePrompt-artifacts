Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines of input, each containing three space-separated integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    k = 0
    if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
        print(-1)
    else:
        k += a + (b + c) // 3
        if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            k += 1
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is greater than 0, i is 0, a, b, c are integers, k is 0, stdin contains no input. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of b divided by 3 and c is less than 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, k is set to a plus the integer division of b + c by 3, and if the sum of b and c is not divisible by 3, k is increased by 1, and the value of k is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, i is 1, k is 0, a, b, c are undefined, stdin contains no input. If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if (b + c) % 3 != 0, an error will occur because k is undefined. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, and k is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, a, b, c are integers, stdin contains no input. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b modulo 3 and c is less than 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, k is updated to be the sum of its initial value, a, and the integer division of b plus c by 3, and if the remainder of the division of b plus c by 3 is not 0, k is increased by 1, and the value of k is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
