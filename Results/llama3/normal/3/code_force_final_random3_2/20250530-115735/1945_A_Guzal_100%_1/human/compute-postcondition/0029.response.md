Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is equal to the initial value of `k` plus `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3 plus 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input.
