Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, a, b, c are integers, k is 0, stdin contains no input**

The code first reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers. The second line initializes `k` to 0. The initial values of `n` and `i` are not changed by the code, so `n` remains greater than 0 and `i` remains 0. The input is consumed by the first line, so stdin is now empty.
