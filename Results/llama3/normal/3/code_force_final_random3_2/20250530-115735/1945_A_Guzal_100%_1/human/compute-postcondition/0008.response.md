Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers, `k` is `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3, stdin contains no input, either `b` is divisible by 3 or the sum of the remainder of `b` divided by 3 and `c` is greater than or equal to 3. The current value of the sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3***
