Output: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers, stdin contains no input. `k` is equal to the initial value of `k` plus `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3. If the remainder of the division of `b + c` by 3 is not 0, `k` is increased by 1, and the value of `k` is being printed**
