Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is equal to the initial value of `k` plus `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3, `a`, `b`, `c` are integers, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to include the sum of `a` and the integer division of `b + c` by 3, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains no input.
