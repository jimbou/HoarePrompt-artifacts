Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, a, b, c are integers, stdin contains no input. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b modulo 3 and c is less than 3, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, k is updated to be the sum of its initial value, a, and the integer division of b plus c by 3, and if the remainder of the division of b plus c by 3 is not 0, k is increased by 1, and the value of k is printed.***
