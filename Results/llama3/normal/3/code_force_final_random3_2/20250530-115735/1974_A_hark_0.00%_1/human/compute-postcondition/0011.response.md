Based on the initial state, we know that `x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 99, and `y` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 99. Additionally, we know that either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both are 0, but it is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. This means that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.

The `print` statement is `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`. Here, `math.ceil` is a function that returns the smallest integer not less than the given number.

Since `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, the value of `x / 15` will be a non-negative number less than or equal to 6.66 (since 99 / 15 = 6.6).

The `math.ceil` function will round up this value to the nearest integer. Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer not less than `x / 15`.

Output: **the smallest integer not less than x / 15 (where x is the current value of x, which is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)**
