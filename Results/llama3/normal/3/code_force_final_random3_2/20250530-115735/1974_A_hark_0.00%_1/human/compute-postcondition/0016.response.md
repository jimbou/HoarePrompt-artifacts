Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers less than or equal to 99, stdin is empty. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both are 0. It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.***
