Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, and the function `func_2()` has been executed `t` times.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `_` (underscore), which is the loop counter, will have reached a value of `t-1` since it increments by 1 in each iteration and the loop runs `t` times. Additionally, the function `func_2()` will have been executed `t` times, once in each iteration of the loop.
