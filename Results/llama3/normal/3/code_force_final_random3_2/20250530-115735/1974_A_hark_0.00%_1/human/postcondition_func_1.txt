This function reads two non-negative integers x and y from standard input, where x and y are less than or equal to 99. It then performs calculations based on the values of x and y. If both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates and prints the sum of two positive integers, bxsfory1 and bxsfory. If either x is 0 or y is 0 or both are 0, it prints either the ceiling of half of y (if x is 0 and y is greater than 0), the ceiling of the division of x by 15 (if x is greater than 0 and y is 0), or 0 (in all other cases). The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated result to the standard output.
