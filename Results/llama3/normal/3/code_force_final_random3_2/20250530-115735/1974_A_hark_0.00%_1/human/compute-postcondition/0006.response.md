Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 2, and the function `func_2()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The only change is that the function `func_2()` has been executed, but its effects are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine any further changes to the state.
