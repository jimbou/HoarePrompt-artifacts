Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop, given the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

The provided program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. However, `func_1` is not used anywhere in the program, so we can ignore it.

`func_2` is the main function that calculates the minimum number of screens needed. It takes the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons as input and performs the following calculations:

1. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) and subtracts the remaining space from the total number of 1x1 icons (`x`). It then calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`) and adds it to `bxsfory`.
2. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it simply calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
3. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`).
4. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

`func_3` is the main function that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case.

The program seems to be correct, as it covers all possible cases and performs the necessary calculations to determine the minimum number of screens needed.

Correctness: **True**
