Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, and the function `func_2()` has been executed**.

The code snippet is simply a function call to `func_2()`, which has already been executed according to the initial state. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged. The values of `t` and `_` are still the same, and the function `func_2()` has already been executed, so there is no change in its execution status.
