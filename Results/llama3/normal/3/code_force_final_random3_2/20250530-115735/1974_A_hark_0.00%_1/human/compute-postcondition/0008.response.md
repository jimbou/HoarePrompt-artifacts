Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, and the function `func_2()` has been executed `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged (it's still an integer between 1 and 10^4), the variable `_` (which is the loop counter) has reached a value of `t-1` (since the loop iterates `t` times and `_` starts at 0), and the function `func_2()` has been executed a total of `t` times.
