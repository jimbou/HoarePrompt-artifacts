Output: **`x` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 99, `y` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 99, stdin is empty. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both are 0. It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. The current value of `x` is greater than 0 and the current value of `y` is 0, and the ceiling of the division of the current value of `x` by 15 is being printed**
