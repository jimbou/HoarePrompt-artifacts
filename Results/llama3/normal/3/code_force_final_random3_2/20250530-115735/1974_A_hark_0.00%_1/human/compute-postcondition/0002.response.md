Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 0, and the function `func_2()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only executed the function `func_2()`, which does not modify any variables in the initial state. The function `func_2()` has been executed, but its effects are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine any changes it may have made.
