The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is less than or equal to 10^9 and `k` is less than its original value, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is (1 << `k`.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are zeros, `i` is 1**
