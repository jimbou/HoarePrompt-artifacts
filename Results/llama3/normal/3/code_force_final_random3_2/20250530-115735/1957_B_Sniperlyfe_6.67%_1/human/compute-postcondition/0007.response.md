Output State: **n is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where all elements are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, i is n - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `n` remains unchanged, `k` becomes 0, all elements in the list `nums` are set to the maximum possible value that can be represented by `k` (i.e., `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`), and the loop counter `i` reaches the last index of the list `nums`, which is `n - 1`.
