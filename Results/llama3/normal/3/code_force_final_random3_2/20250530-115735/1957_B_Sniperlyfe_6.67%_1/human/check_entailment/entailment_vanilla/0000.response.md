Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that the sum of these integers is k and the number of 1s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases t and initializing an empty list results to store the output for each test case.

2. For each test case, the program reads two integers n and k, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and the sum respectively.

3. The program then calls the function func_1 with n and k as arguments. This function is designed to construct the sequence of n non-negative integers that satisfy the given conditions.

4. Inside the func_1 function, the program initializes a list nums of size n with all elements set to 0. This list will store the constructed sequence of non-negative integers.

5. The program then enters a loop that runs n times. In each iteration, the program calculates the value of the current integer in the sequence using the expression (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1. This expression calculates the maximum possible value for the current integer such that its binary representation has the maximum number of 1s.

6. The program then subtracts the calculated value from k and assigns it to the current integer in the sequence.

7. After the loop, the program adds the remaining value of k to the last integer in the sequence. This ensures that the sum of all integers in the sequence is equal to k.

8. Finally, the program returns the constructed sequence of non-negative integers.

9. The main program appends the result of each test case to the results list and prints the results at the end.

Based on the above analysis, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
