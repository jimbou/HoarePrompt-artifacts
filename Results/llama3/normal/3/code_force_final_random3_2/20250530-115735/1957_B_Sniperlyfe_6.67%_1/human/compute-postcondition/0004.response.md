Output State: **n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, k is a positive integer such that k is less than or equal to 10^9 and k is less than its original value, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are zeros except for the second element which is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, i is 1**

The first line assigns the value of (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 to the second element of the list nums. Since k is a positive integer such that k is less than or equal to 10^9 and k is less than its original value, the value of (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 is less than the original value of k. The second line subtracts the value of the second element of nums from k, making k even smaller. The value of n, the length of the list nums, remains unchanged. The value of i, which is 1, also remains unchanged.
