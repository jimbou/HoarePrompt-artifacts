The code `nums[-1] += k` adds the value of `k` to the last element of the list `nums`. Since `k` is 0, the value of the last element of `nums` remains unchanged. The last element of `nums` is still `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `k` is 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`.**
