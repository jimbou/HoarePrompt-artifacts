#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that n <= 2 * 10^5 and k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: n is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where all elements are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, i is n - 1
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of 'n' integers where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, 'n' is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, 'k' is 0

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of 'n' integers, where all elements are the maximum possible value that can be represented by 'k' bits, and the last element is incremented by the remaining value of 'k'. The function takes two positive integers 'n' and 'k' as input, where 'n' is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 and 'k' is less than or equal to 10^9. The function returns the generated list of integers, with 'k' reduced to 0.
