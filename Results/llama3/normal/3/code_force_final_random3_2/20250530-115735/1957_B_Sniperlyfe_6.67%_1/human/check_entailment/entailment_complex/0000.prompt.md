Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that n <= 2 * 10^5 and k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: n is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where all elements are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, i is n - 1
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of 'n' integers where all elements are `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, 'n' is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, 'k' is 0

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of 'n' integers, where all elements are the maximum possible value that can be represented by 'k' bits, and the last element is incremented by the remaining value of 'k'. The function takes two positive integers 'n' and 'k' as input, where 'n' is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 and 'k' is less than or equal to 10^9. The function returns the generated list of integers, with 'k' reduced to 0.
