Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The code creates a new list `nums` with `n` elements, all initialized to zero. The length of the list `nums` is equal to the value of `n`, which is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^5.
