The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer such that n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is a positive integer such that k <= 10^9, and nums is a list of n zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of n zeros, `i` is 0**
