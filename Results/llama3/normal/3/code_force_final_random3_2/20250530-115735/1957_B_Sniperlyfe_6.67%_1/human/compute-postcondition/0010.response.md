Functionality: **This function generates a list of 'n' integers, where all elements are the maximum possible value that can be represented by 'k' bits, and the last element is incremented by the remaining value of 'k'. The function takes two positive integers 'n' and 'k' as input, where 'n' is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 and 'k' is less than or equal to 10^9. The function returns the generated list of integers, with 'k' reduced to 0.**
