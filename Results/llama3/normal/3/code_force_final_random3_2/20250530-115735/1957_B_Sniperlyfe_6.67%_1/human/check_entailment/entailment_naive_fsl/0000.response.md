Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is 1 and k is greater than 0. In this case, the function func_1 will return a list with a single element, which is the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits. However, this does not satisfy the condition that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the sequence is maximized.

For example, if n is 1 and k is 5, the program will return [31], which has only 5 bits set to 1. However, the correct answer should be [5], which has only 3 bits set to 1, but it is the maximum possible number of 1s that can be achieved with a single number.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
