Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four integers. It calculates a value for each test case by summing the results of a specific calculation involving the four integers, and then prints the result of this calculation divided by 3, one result per line. The function processes multiple test cases, as specified by an initial integer input indicating the number of test cases to follow.**
