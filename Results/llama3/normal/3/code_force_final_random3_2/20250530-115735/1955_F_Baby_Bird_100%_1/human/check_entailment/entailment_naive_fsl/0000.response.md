Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is 2 2 2 0, the program will output 3, but the correct output should be 3. However, if the input is 1 1 1 1, the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win. The program uses a formula that does not take into account the actual numbers in the sequence, but rather just their counts. This leads to incorrect results in certain cases.

A correct solution would need to take into account the actual numbers in the sequence and how they can be removed to maximize the number of times Bob wins.
