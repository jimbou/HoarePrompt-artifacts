Output: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and the following is printed: 
the integer division by 3 of the sum of 3 times the integer division of each of the four integers by 2 plus the remainder of the division of each of the four integers by 2 times 1 if the index of the integer is less than 3, for each of the t lines**
