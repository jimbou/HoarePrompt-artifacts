Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

The program uses a clever formula to calculate the maximum number of wins for Bob. The formula is based on the fact that Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The formula calculates the sum of the number of pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero, and then divides this sum by 3 to get the maximum number of wins for Bob.

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each test case. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
