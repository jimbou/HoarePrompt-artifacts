This function takes a single integer x as input and returns a list of its divisors and their corresponding quotient values. The list contains the quotient values first, followed by the divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of x, in reverse order. The function assumes that x is a positive integer with at least two divisors (i.e., x is not a prime number).
