#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than the second integer and the second integer is greater than 0.
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: `output1` contains all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotient values.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that contains the corresponding quotient values of the divisors of `x` and all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a single integer x as input and returns a list of its divisors and their corresponding quotient values. The list contains the quotient values first, followed by the divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of x, in reverse order. The function assumes that x is a positive integer with at least two divisors (i.e., x is not a prime number).
