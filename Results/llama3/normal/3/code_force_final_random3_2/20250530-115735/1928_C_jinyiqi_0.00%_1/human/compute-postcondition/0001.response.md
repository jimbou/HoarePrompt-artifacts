To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is greater than or equal to 1 (since `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1). Additionally, `i` will start at 1.

State: **`x` is a list of two integers that must have at least one element greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer and the second integer is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list**
