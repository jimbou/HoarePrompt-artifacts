Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. The program takes two integers, n and x, as input, where n is Vasya's position in the line and x is the number Vasya received during the settling.

The program first checks if (n + x - 2) and (n - x) are even numbers. If they are, it calls the function func_1 to find the divisors of these numbers. The function func_1 returns a list of divisors and their corresponding quotient values.

The program then checks if the divisors returned by func_1 are greater than or equal to x and if they are even numbers. If they are, it adds them to the output list.

Finally, the program removes duplicates from the output list and returns the count of unique values.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program is correctly implementing the logic to find the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
