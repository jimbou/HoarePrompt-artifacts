The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. This means that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second last, and so on.

Output State: **`output1` contains all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotient values.**

In other words, the order of the divisors in `output1` has been reversed, but the values themselves remain the same. The corresponding quotient values in `output2` are not affected by this operation.
