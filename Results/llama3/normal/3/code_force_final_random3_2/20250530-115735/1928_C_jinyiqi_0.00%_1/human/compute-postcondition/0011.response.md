Output State: **`output1` contains all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotient values.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, `output1` will contain all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding quotient values. This is because the loop iterates over all numbers from 1 to the square root of `x`, and for each number `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it appends `i` to `output1` and the quotient `x/i` to `output2`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, it simply moves on to the next number.
