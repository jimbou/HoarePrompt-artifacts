Postcondition: **`x` is a list of two integers that must have at least one element greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer and the second integer is greater than 0. If the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, then `output1` is a list containing the values 2 and 2, and `output2` is a list containing the value equal to the original value of `x` divided by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `output1` and `output2`.**
