Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` and `x` are both equal to 1. In this case, the program should output 0, but it outputs 1. This is because the program does not handle the case when `n` and `x` are both 1 correctly. 

The problem description states that the settling exists if and only if `k > 1`. However, the program does not check for this condition and incorrectly assumes that `k` can be 1. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
