Postcondition: ***`x` is a list of two integers that must have at least one element greater than or equal to 1, the first integer is greater than the second integer and the second integer is greater than 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `output1` contains the new value of `i`, and `output2` contains the integer division of `x` by the new value of `i`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged, and `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged.***
