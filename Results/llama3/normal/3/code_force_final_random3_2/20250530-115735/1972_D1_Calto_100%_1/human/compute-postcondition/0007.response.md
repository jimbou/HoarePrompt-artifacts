Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, cnt is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the sum of the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i) plus 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i) for all i from 1 to m, i is m.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` remains a positive integer, `m` remains a positive integer, and `cnt` is updated to be its original value plus the sum of the ceiling of `(n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i)` plus 1 if `(n - (i * i - i))` is divisible by `(i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`. The loop variable `i` is equal to `m` after the loop finishes executing.
