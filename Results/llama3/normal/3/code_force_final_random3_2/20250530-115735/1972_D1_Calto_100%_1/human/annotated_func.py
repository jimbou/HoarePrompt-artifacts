#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is a positive integer and is equal to the greatest common divisor of the initial a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a positive integer that is equal to the greatest common divisor of the initial a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, a and b, using the Euclidean algorithm. It takes two positive integers as input and returns their GCD as a positive integer. The function does not modify the input variables, but rather returns a new value representing their GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, cnt is a positive integer equal to its original value plus the sum of the ceiling of (n - i^2 + i) / i^2 plus 1 if (n - i^2 + i) is a multiple of i^2 for all i from 1 to m, x is n - (m * m - m), y is m * m
    return cnt
    #The program returns the positive integer cnt which is equal to its original value plus the sum of the ceiling of (n - i^2 + i) / i^2 plus 1 if (n - i^2 + i) is a multiple of i^2 for all i from 1 to m, where n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and the original value of cnt is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the total count of a specific mathematical expression for a given range of positive integers. The function takes two positive integers n and m as input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns a positive integer cnt. The cnt value is the sum of the ceiling of (n - i^2 + i) / i^2 plus 1 if (n - i^2 + i) is a multiple of i^2 for all i from 1 to m. The function effectively computes a cumulative count based on the given mathematical expression, iterating over the range from 1 to m.
