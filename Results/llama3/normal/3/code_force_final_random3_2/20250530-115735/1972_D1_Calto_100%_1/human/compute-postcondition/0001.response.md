The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and `cnt` is -1, but these conditions do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `cnt` is -1, `i` is 1**
