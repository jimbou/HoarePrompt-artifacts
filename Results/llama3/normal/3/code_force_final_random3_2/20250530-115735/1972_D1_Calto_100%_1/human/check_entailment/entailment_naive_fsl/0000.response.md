Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the mathematical formula to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The key insight is that the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b) can be rewritten as a = k * b * gcd(a,b) for some integer k. This means that a is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b), and therefore a/b is an integer multiple of gcd(a,b).

The program uses two functions: func_1 to calculate the gcd of two numbers, and func_2 to calculate the number of ordered pairs. func_2 iterates over all possible values of i from 1 to m, and for each i, it calculates the number of possible values of a that satisfy the condition.

The calculation of x and y in func_2 is correct, and the use of math.ceil to round up the division is also correct. The addition of (x % y == 0) is also correct, as it accounts for the case where x is exactly divisible by y.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n or m is 1. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the mathematical formula to calculate the number of ordered pairs satisfying the given conditions.
