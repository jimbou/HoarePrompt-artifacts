Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem involving the calculation of the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers `a` and `b`. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD, which is a well-established and efficient method for this purpose.

`func_2` calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. The function iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m`, and for each `i`, it calculates the value of `x` and `y` based on the given conditions. It then updates the count `cnt` by adding the ceiling of `x / y` plus 1 if `x` is divisible by `y`. This is done for all `i` from 1 to `m`.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and calls `func_2` to calculate the result. The result is then printed.

Based on the provided annotations, it appears that the program is correctly implementing the required logic. The use of the Euclidean algorithm in `func_1` is correct, and the calculation of the count in `func_2` seems to be accurate.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The problem statement mentions that the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6. But the program does not check for this condition. If the sum of `n` and `m` exceeds this limit, the program may produce incorrect results or run into performance issues.

Despite this potential issue, the program seems to be correct based on the provided annotations.

Correctness: **True**
