Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

`func_2` calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given n and m. It iterates over all possible values of i from 1 to m, and for each i, it calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) such that a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The calculation involves some mathematical manipulations and uses the `math.ceil` function to round up to the nearest integer.

The program does not explicitly use `func_1` to calculate the gcd, but instead relies on the mathematical properties of the problem to simplify the calculation.

After analyzing the program, it appears to be correct. The logic in `func_2` seems to be sound, and the use of `math.ceil` is appropriate to handle the rounding up of the division result.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The loop in `func_2` iterates over all possible values of i from 1 to m, but the calculation inside the loop assumes that i is a divisor of b. This assumption is not always true, and it can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the case where n = 10, m = 8, and i = 3. The calculation inside the loop will produce an incorrect result because 3 is not a divisor of 8.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
