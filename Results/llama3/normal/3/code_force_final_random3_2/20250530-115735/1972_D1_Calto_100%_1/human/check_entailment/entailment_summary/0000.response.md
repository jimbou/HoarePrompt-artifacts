Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, which is a crucial component in determining whether a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 2 calculates the sum of the ceiling of (n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i) plus 1 if (n - (i * i - i)) is divisible by (i * i) for all i from 1 to m. This calculation seems to be related to the condition a + b being a multiple of b * gcd(a, b), but it's not immediately clear how it achieves this.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that Function 2 is actually counting the number of valid pairs (a, b) by iterating over all possible values of i (which represents b in the problem statement). For each i, it calculates the maximum value of a that satisfies the condition a + b being a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) and adds it to the count.

The key insight here is that the expression (n - (i * i - i)) / (i * i) represents the maximum value of a that satisfies the condition, and the ceiling function is used to round up to the nearest integer. The additional term (x % y == 0) checks whether the remainder of the division is zero, which is equivalent to checking whether a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Therefore, Function 2 correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions, and the program as a whole is correct.

Correctness: **True**
