Calculates and returns the total count of a specific mathematical expression for a given range of positive integers. The function takes two positive integers n and m as input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and returns a positive integer cnt. The cnt value is the sum of the ceiling of (n - i^2 + i) / i^2 plus 1 if (n - i^2 + i) is a multiple of i^2 for all i from 1 to m. The function effectively computes a cumulative count based on the given mathematical expression, iterating over the range from 1 to m.
