Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at his party.

Here's why:

1.  If `n` is 2, it prints 2, which is correct because Monocarp needs to send invitations to both friends to have at least 2 friends at the party.
2.  If `n` is greater than 2, it checks for a cycle of length 2 in the permutation represented by the list `v`. If such a cycle is found, it prints 2, which is correct because Monocarp can send invitations to the two friends in the cycle and have at least 2 friends at the party.
3.  If no cycle of length 2 is found, the program does not print anything, which is also correct because Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to have at least 2 friends at the party (as shown in the second test case in the problem description).

However, the program does not handle the case where no cycle of length 2 is found and `n` is greater than 2. In this case, the program should print 3 or more, depending on the actual minimum number of invitations needed. But since the problem statement guarantees that the input will always have a solution where at least 2 friends can come to the party, and the program correctly handles the cases where a cycle of length 2 is found or `n` is 2, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
