Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n. If n equals 2, the number 2 is printed. If n is between 3 and 50 inclusive, and if v[v[v[i]]] equals i for any i in the range from 1 to n, the number 2 is printed.***
