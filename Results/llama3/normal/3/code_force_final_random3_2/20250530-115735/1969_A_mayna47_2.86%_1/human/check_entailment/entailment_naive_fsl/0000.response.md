Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it handles all the potential cases as described in the problem description. 

The program first checks if the number of friends is 2, in which case it prints 2 because both friends need to be invited. 

If the number of friends is more than 2, it checks for each friend if their best friend's best friend is themselves. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2 because inviting these two friends will result in at least two friends coming to the party. 

If it doesn't find such a pair, it prints 3 because in the worst case, inviting three friends will result in at least two friends coming to the party. 

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and potential scenarios, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.
