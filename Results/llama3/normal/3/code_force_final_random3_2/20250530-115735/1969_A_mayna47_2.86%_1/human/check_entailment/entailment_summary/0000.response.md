Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at his party. 

The program first checks if the number of friends is 2, in which case it prints 2 because both friends need to be invited. 

If the number of friends is greater than 2, it checks for a cycle of length 2 in the permutation represented by the list of best friends. If such a cycle is found, it prints 2 because only 2 invitations are needed to have at least 2 friends at the party. 

If no cycle of length 2 is found, it prints 3 because at least 3 invitations are needed to have at least 2 friends at the party. 

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases. 

Correctness: **True**
