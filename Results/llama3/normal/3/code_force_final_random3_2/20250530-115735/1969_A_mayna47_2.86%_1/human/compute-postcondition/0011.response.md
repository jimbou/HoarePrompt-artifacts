To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `v` and `stdin` also remains the same, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, `i` is 2, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`**
