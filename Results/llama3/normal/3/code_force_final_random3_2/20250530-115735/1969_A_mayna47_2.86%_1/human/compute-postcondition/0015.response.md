To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `stdin`, `v`, and the condition `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, `i` is 3**
