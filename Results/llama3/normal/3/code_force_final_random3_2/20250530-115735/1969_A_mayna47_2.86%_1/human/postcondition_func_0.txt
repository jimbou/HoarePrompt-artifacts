This function reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers from standard input, and checks if there exists a cycle of length 2 in the permutation represented by the list. If n is 2, it prints 2. If n is greater than 2, it checks for a cycle of length 2 by iterating through the list and checking if the permutation of the permutation of each element is equal to the element itself. If such a cycle is found, it prints 2.
