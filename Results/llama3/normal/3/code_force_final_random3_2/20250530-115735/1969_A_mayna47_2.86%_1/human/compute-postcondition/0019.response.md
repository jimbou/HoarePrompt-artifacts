Output State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, `i` is n, and if `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i` for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, the number 2 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the input variables `stdin`, `n`, and `v` remains unchanged. The loop variable `i` has reached its final value of `n`. Additionally, if at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` was true for any `i` between 1 and `n`, the number 2 would have been printed.
