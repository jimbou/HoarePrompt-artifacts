To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already given to be between 3 and 50 inclusive, it is guaranteed to be at least 1. However, to make the loop execute, `i` needs to be adjusted to start from 1.

State: **`stdin` contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, `v` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n, `i` is 1**
