Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party. The program takes into account the fact that each friend has a best friend and that both the friend and their best friend need to receive an invitation for the friend to come to the party.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and their best friends `p_i` (stored in the list `v`).
3. If `n` is 2, it immediately prints 2, as both friends need to receive an invitation to come to the party.
4. If `n` is greater than 2, it checks for each friend `i` whether their best friend's best friend is `i` itself (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If it finds such a pair, it prints 2 and returns, as sending invitations to these two friends will result in at least 2 friends coming to the party.
5. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, as sending invitations to at least 3 friends is required to guarantee that at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program's logic is correct, as it covers all possible cases:

* If `n` is 2, sending invitations to both friends is the only way to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
* If `n` is greater than 2, finding a pair of friends where each is the other's best friend's best friend guarantees that sending invitations to these two friends will result in at least 2 friends coming to the party. If no such pair is found, sending invitations to at least 3 friends is required to guarantee that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Correctness: **True**
