Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo MOD, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 2, k is n - 2, i is the second last element in the list arr, and the character at index k in the list s is 'R'.**

The code modifies the values of `ans`, `res[c]`, and `r`. The first line updates `ans` by dividing it by the integer at index `r` in `arr` and taking the modulus `MOD`. The second line updates `res[c]` by taking the modulus `m` and `MOD` of `ans`. The third line decrements `r` by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `l`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.
