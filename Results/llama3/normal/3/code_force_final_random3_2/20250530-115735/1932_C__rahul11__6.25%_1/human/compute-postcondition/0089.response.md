Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, c is n + 1, l is n if the number of 'L's in s is greater than or equal to the number of 'R's in s, otherwise l is n - 1, r is 0 if the number of 'L's in s is greater than or equal to the number of 'R's in s, otherwise r is 1, k is -1, i is the first element in the list arr.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The value of MOD, n, m, arr, and s remains unchanged. The value of res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD. The value of ans is 1. The value of c is n + 1. The value of l is n if the number of 'L's in s is greater than or equal to the number of 'R's in s, otherwise l is n - 1. The value of r is 0 if the number of 'L's in s is greater than or equal to the number of 'R's in s, otherwise r is 1. The value of k is -1. The value of i is the first element in the list arr.
