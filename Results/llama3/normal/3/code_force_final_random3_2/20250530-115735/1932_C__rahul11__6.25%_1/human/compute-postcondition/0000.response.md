Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), then a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.**

The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value 1000000006. This is the only change to the state of the program. The values of the other variables and the contents of stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
