Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer, `s` is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', `res` is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, `ans` is the product of the first element of `arr` and 1, `c` is n, `l` is n, `r` is 0, `k` is n - 1, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`, and the elements of the list `res` are being printed, and the input must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of the first element of `arr` and 1, which is equal to the first element of `arr`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
