The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `i` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^4 that must have at least 3 integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n zeros, ans is equal to the product of the third integer in the list and the third integer in the list, _ is 0, i is the third integer in the list**
