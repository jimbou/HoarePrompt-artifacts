To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `k` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range is `n - 1`. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2, and `k` should be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, `n` is an integer at least 2 and at most 2*10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is an empty list, `s` is a list of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `res` is a list of `n` integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros, `ans` is equal to the product of all integers in the list, `_` is 0, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n` - 1, `k` is 0**
