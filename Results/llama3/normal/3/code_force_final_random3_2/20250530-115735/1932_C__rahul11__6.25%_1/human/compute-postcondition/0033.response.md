The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr. If arr has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, the state does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer and i is now the first integer in the list.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer, `s` is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is 1, `_` is 1, `i` is the first integer in the list, `c` is n, `l` is n if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 0, `r` is 0 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 1, `k` is n - 1, and stdin is empty.**
