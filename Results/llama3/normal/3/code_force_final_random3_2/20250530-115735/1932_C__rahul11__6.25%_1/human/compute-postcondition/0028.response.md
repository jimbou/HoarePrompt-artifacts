Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer at least 1 and at most 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros except for the third element which is equal to ans % m % MOD and the fifth element which is equal to ans % m % MOD and so on until the last element which is equal to ans % m % MOD, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list divided by the first element of arr if s[k] is 'L', otherwise divided by arr[r] % MOD, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is n, l is n if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 0, r is 0 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 1, k is n - 1.**

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has iterated n-1 times, and in each iteration, it has updated the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
