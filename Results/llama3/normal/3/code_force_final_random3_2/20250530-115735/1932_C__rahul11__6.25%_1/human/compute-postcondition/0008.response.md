Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^4 that must have at least 3 integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n zeros, ans is equal to the product of the third integer in the list squared, _ is 0, i is the third integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of the third integer in the list squared, as it was multiplied by the third integer in the list `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
