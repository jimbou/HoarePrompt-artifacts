Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1**

The code executes as follows: The first line assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to the first element of the list `res`. The second line assigns the value 1 to the variable `c`. The third line assigns the value 0 to the variable `l`. The fourth line assigns the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. No other variables are affected.
