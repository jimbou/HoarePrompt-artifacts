Postcondition: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R'. If s[k] is 'L', res is a list of n integers with the first two elements being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the product of the first two elements of arr modulo MOD, c is 3, l is 2, and r is n - 1. If s[k] is 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo MOD, c is 2, l is 1, and r is n - 2.**
