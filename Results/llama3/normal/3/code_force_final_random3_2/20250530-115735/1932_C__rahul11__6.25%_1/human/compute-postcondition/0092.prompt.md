Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), then a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer at least 1 and at most 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros except for the third element which is equal to ans % m % MOD and the fifth element which is equal to ans % m % MOD and so on until the last element which is equal to ans % m % MOD, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list divided by the first element of arr if s[k] is 'L', otherwise divided by arr[r] % MOD, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is n, l is n if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 0, r is 0 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 1, k is n - 1, and the following is printed: the list res containing the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros except for the third element which is equal to ans % m % MOD and the fifth element which is equal to ans % m % MOD and so on until the last element which is equal to ans % m % MOD

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, c is n, l is n, r is 0, k is n - 1, and the elements of the list res are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, c is n + 1, l is n if the number of 'L's in s is greater than or equal to the number of 'R's in s, otherwise l is n - 1, r is 0 if the number of 'L's in s is greater than or equal to the number of 'R's in s, otherwise r is 1, k is -1, i is the first element in the list arr, and the list of integers res is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
