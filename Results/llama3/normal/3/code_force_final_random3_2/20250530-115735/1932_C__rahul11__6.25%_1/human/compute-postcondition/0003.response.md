The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 integer the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^4, so for the loop to be executed `arr` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^4 that must have at least 1 integer, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n zeros, ans is 1, _ is 0, i is the first integer in the list**
