Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD. If s[k] is 'L', the second element of res is the product of all integers in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr except the first one, c is 3, l is 1, and r is n - 1. If s[k] is 'R', ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD, c is 2, l is 0, and r is n - 2.**

In this output state, the value of c has been incremented by 1. If s[k] is 'L', c is now 3, and if s[k] is 'R', c is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
