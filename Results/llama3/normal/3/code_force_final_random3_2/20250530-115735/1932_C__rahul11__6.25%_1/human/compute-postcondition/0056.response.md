Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the second element being the product of all integers in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', ans is the product of all integers in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', c is 4 if s[k] is 'L', or 3 if s[k] is 'R', l is 3 if s[k] is 'L' and k is 2, or 1 if s[k] is 'R' and k is 2, or 0 if s[k] is 'R' and k is not 2, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', or n - 2 if s[k] is 'R', k is 2***
