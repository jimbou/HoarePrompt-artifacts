Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr, _ is 1, i is the last integer in the list, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1, and k is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD. If s[k] is 'L', the second element of res is the product of all integers in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr except the first one, c is 3, l is 1, and r is n - 1. If s[k] is 'R', ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD, c is 2, l is 0, and r is n - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the second element being the product of all integers in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', ans is the product of all integers in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', c is 4 if s[k] is 'L', or 3 if s[k] is 'R', l is 2 if s[k] is 'L' and k is 1, or 1 if s[k] is 'R' and k is 1, or 0 if s[k] is 'R' and k is not 1, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', or n - 2 if s[k] is 'R', k is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the second element being the product of all integers in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', ans is the product of all integers in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', c is 5 if s[k] is 'L', or 4 if s[k] is 'R', l is 3 if s[k] is 'L' and k is 2, or 1 if s[k] is 'R' and k is 2, or 0 if s[k] is 'R' and k is not 2, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', or n - 2 if s[k] is 'R', k is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
