Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, n is an integer at least 2 and at most 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list divided by arr[r] % MOD, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 2, k is 0, and s[k] is 'R'.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by dividing it by `arr[r]` and taking the modulus `MOD`. The value of `res[c]` has been updated to be equal to `ans % m % MOD`. The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
