The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), then a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'. So for the loop to be executed the input must be at least 1 and _ is 0.
