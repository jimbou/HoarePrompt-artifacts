Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n zeros, ans is 1, _ is 1, i is the last integer in the list, c is n, l is n if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 0, r is 0 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 1, k is n - 1, and stdin is empty.**

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`, respectively. It then reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. The next line reads a string of `n` characters from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The following lines initialize `res` as a list of `n` zeros, set `ans` to 1, and do not modify any other variables. The final state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s`, as well as the unchanged values of `MOD`, `ans`, `_`, `i`, `c`, `l`, `r`, and `k`. Stdin is now empty after reading all inputs.
