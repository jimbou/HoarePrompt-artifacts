Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the second element being the product of all integers in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', ans is the product of all integers in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', c is 4 if s[k] is 'L', or 3 if s[k] is 'R', l is 2 if s[k] is 'L' and k is 1, or 1 if s[k] is 'R' and k is 1, or 0 if s[k] is 'R' and k is not 1, r is n - 2 if s[k] is 'L', or n - 3 if s[k] is 'R', k is 2**

The code modifies the values of `ans`, `res[c]`, and `r`. The value of `ans` is updated by dividing it by the last element of `arr` (at index `r`) and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `res[c]` is updated by assigning the new value of `ans` modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`. The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
