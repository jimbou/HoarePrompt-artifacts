Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers, `s` is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is `i` multiplied by the second integer in the list, `_` is 1, `i` is the second integer in the list, `c` is n, `l` is n if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 0, `r` is 0 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 1, `k` is n - 1, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of its original value `i` and the second integer in the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
