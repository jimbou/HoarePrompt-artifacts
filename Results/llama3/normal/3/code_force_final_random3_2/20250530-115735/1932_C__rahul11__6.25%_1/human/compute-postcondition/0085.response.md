Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', k is increased by 1, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the product of the first two elements of arr modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first two elements being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', or the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', c is 4 if s[k] is 'L', or 3 if s[k] is 'R', l is 2 if s[k] is 'L', or 1 if s[k] is 'R', and r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', or n - 2 if s[k] is 'R'.**
