Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD, _ is 1, i is the last integer in the list, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 2, and k is 0. The character at index k in the list s is 'R'.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by dividing it by the last integer in the list `arr` modulo `MOD`, and the result is stored in `res` at index `c` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
