Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD and the second element being the product of all integers in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', ans is the product of all integers in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R', c is 3 if s[k] is 'L', or 2 if s[k] is 'R', l is 1 if s[k] is 'L', or 0 if s[k] is 'R', r is n - 2, and k is 1.**

In this output state, the values of MOD, n, m, arr, and s remain unchanged. The value of res has been updated to include the second element, which is the product of all integers in arr except the first one modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R'. The value of ans has also been updated to be the product of all integers in arr except the first one if s[k] is 'L', or the product of all integers in arr divided by the last integer in the list modulo MOD if s[k] is 'R'. The values of c, l, and r have been updated based on the value of s[k].
