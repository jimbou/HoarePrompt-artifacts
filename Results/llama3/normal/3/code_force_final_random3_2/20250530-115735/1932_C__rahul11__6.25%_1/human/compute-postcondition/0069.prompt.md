Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is 1, c is n, l is n, r is 0, k is n - 1, and the elements of the list res are being printed, and the input must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    ans *= i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer, `s` is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', `res` is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, `ans` is the product of the first element of `arr` and 1, `c` is n, `l` is n, `r` is 0, `k` is n - 1, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`, and the elements of the list `res` are being printed, and the input must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers, `s` is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', `res` is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, `ans` is the product of the first element of `arr` and the second element of `arr`, `c` is n, `l` is n, `r` is 0, `k` is n - 1, `i` is the second element in the list `arr`, and the elements of the list `res` are being printed, and the input must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of at least 3 integers, `s` is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', `res` is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, `ans` is the product of the first two elements of `arr` and the third element of `arr`, `c` is n, `l` is n, `r` is 0, `k` is n - 1, `i` is the third element in the list `arr`, and the elements of the list `res` are being printed, and the input must be greater than 1, stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
