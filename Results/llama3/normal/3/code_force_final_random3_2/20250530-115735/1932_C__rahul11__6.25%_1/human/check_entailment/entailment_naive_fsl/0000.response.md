Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the remainder of the product of the array elements when divided by m. The program uses the modulo operator (%) twice, which is incorrect. The correct way to calculate the remainder is to use the modulo operator only once.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

    1
    2 2
    2 2
    LR

Output:

    0 0

Expected Output:

    0 1

In this example, the program incorrectly calculates the remainder of the product of the array elements when divided by m. The correct calculation is:

    2 * 2 % 2 = 0
    2 % 2 = 1

The program's incorrect calculation leads to an incorrect output.
