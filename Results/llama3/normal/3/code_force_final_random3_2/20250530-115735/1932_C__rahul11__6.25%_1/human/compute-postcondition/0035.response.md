The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the i is the second integer in the list.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers, `s` is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', `res` is a list of n zeros, `ans` is `i`, `_` is 1, `i` is the second integer in the list, `c` is n, `l` is n if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 0, `r` is 0 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 1, `k` is n - 1, and stdin is empty.**
