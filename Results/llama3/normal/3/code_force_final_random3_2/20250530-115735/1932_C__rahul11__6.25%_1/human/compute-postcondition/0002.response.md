Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^4, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n zeros, ans is 1, _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of MOD remains unchanged as 1000000006. The stdin initially contained an integer t, but after executing the code, it now contains t-1. The variables n and m are assigned values between 1 and 2*10^5 and 1 and 10^4, respectively. The list arr is populated with n integers between 1 and 10^4. The list s contains n characters, either 'L' or 'R'. The list res is initialized with n zeros. The variable ans is set to 1, and the variable _ remains 0.
