Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 1, l is 0, r is n - 1
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer at least 2 and at most 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list divided by the first element of arr if s[k] is 'L', otherwise divided by arr[r] % MOD, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 2, l is 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 0, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 2, k is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer at least 2 and at most 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros except for the third element which is equal to ans % m % MOD, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list divided by the first element of arr if s[k] is 'L', otherwise divided by arr[r] % MOD, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 4 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 2, l is 2 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 1, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 2, k is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer at least 3 and at most 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros except for the third element which is equal to ans % m % MOD and the fifth element which is equal to ans % m % MOD if s[k] is 'L', otherwise the fifth element is not updated, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list divided by the first element of arr if s[k] is 'L', otherwise divided by arr[r] % MOD, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 5 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 3, l is 3 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 2, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 2, k is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
