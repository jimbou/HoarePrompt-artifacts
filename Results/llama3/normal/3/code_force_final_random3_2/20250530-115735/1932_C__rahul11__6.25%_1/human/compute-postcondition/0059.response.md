The code prints the elements of the list `res`. The first element of `res` is the product of all integers in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. The remaining elements of `res` are not explicitly defined in the precondition, so their values cannot be determined.

Output: **the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, and the remaining n-1 elements of the list res (where n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5)**
