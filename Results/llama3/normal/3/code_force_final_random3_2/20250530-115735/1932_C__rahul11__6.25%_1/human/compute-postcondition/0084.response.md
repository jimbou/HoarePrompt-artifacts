Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', k is increased by 1, l is increased by 1, r remains the same, c remains the same, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the product of the first two elements of arr modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', otherwise ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo MOD, res is a list of n integers with the first two elements being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD if s[k] is 'L', otherwise res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` and `res` are updated based on the value of `s[k]`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the product of the first two elements of `arr` modulo `MOD`, and `res` is a list of `n` integers with the first two elements being the product of all integers in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'R', `ans` is the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integer at index `r` in `arr` modulo `MOD`, and `res` is a list of `n` integers with the first element being the product of all integers in `arr` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. The value of `k` is increased by 1, and the value of `l` is increased by 1. The values of `MOD`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `c`, and `r` remain the same.
