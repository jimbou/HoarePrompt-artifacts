Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers (n and m) and a list of n integers, followed by a string of n characters ('L' and 'R'). It calculates the product of the integers modulo m and MOD (1000000006), and then iterates through the string, updating the product by dividing it by the corresponding integer in the list based on the character in the string ('L' or 'R'). The function prints the resulting list of products modulo m and MOD.**
