Postcondition: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the first element of arr modulo MOD if the character at index k in the list s is 'L', otherwise ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo MOD, c is 1, l is 1 if the character at index k in the list s is 'L', otherwise l is 0, r is n - 1 if the character at index k in the list s is 'L', otherwise r is n - 2, k is n - 2, i is the second last element in the list arr.**
