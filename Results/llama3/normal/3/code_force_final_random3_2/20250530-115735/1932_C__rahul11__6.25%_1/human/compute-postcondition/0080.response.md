Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo MOD, c is 2, l is 1 if the character at index k in the list s is 'L', otherwise l is 0, r is n - 2, k is n - 1, i is the second last element in the list arr.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of all integers in `arr` divided by the integer at index `r` in `arr` modulo `MOD`, because the character at index `k` in the list `s` is 'L'. The value of `res[c]` has been updated to be the value of `ans` modulo `m` modulo `MOD`. The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. No other variables have been affected.
