Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n zeros, ans is the product of all integers in arr, _ is 1, i is the last integer in the list, c is n, l is n if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 0, r is 0 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 1, k is n - 1, and stdin is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the product of all integers in the list `arr`, and the value of `i` is the last integer in the list `arr`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
