Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of n integers, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R'. If s[k] is 'L', then res is a list of n integers with the first two elements being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the product of the first two elements of arr modulo MOD, c is 5, l is 2, and r is n - 1. If s[k] is 'R', then res is a list of n integers with the first element being the product of all integers in arr modulo m modulo MOD, ans is the product of all integers in arr divided by the integer at index r in arr modulo MOD, c is 4, l is 1, and r is n - 2. In both cases, k is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of c has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
