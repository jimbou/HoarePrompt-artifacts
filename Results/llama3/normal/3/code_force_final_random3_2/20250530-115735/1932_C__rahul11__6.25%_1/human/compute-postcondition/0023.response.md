The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and n. If k is less than n - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is 1 and n is at least 2 and at most 2*10^5. For the loop to execute again, k must be increased by 1, so k is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer at least 3 and at most 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros except for the third element which is equal to ans % m % MOD, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list divided by the first element of arr if s[k] is 'L', otherwise divided by arr[r] % MOD, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 4 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 2, l is 2 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 1, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 2, k is 2**
