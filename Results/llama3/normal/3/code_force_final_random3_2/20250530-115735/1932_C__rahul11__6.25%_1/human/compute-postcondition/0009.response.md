Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 1 input: an integer t minus 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n zeros, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` is empty, and the variable `ans` holds the product of all integers that were initially in the list `arr`. The variable `i` holds the last integer that was processed in the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
