Output State: **MOD is 1000000006, stdin contains 0 inputs, n is an integer at least 3 and at most 2*10^5, m is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is an empty list, s is a list of n characters 'L' and 'R', res is a list of n integers with the first element equal to ans % m % MOD and the rest are zeros except for the third element which is equal to ans % m % MOD and the fifth element which is equal to ans % m % MOD if s[k] is 'L', otherwise the fifth element is not updated, ans is equal to the product of all integers in the list divided by the first element of arr if s[k] is 'L', otherwise divided by arr[r] % MOD, _ is 0, i is the last integer in the list, c is 5 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 3, l is 3 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise 2, r is n - 1 if s[k] is 'L', otherwise n - 2, k is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of c has been incremented by 1. If s[k] is 'L', then c is now 5, otherwise it is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
