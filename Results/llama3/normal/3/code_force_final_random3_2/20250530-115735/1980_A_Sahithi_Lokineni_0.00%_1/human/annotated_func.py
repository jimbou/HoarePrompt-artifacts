#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: two integers n and m, and a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. 1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no input and returns 0, effectively doing nothing.
