Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers with an additional element 0, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `n-1` `n-1` 0 0. The input is '=', `s` is the input, '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is `n-1`, then another `mak` which is `n-1`, then the value of `i` which is 0, and another `i` which is 0, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is `n-1`, then another `mak` which is `n-1`, then the value of `i` which is 0, and another `i` which is 0 is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is `n-1`, then another `mak2` which is `n-1`, then the value of `i` which is 0, and another `mak2` which is `n-1`. The current value of `s` is '='.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still 0, `mak` and `mak2` are still `n-1`. The list `pans` now has an additional element, which is 0. The output buffer is still flushed, and the same text is printed as before. The input is still '=', and the current value of `s` is still '='.
