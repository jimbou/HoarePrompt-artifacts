Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `?` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak` is a variable that can take on different values depending on the input string. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1. Since the exact value of `mak` depends on the input string, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe its possible values.
* `i` is a variable that is set to 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string that starts with `?`, followed by the value of `mak` (which can be 0, 1, or 2), followed by another `mak`, followed by the value of `i` (which is 3), and finally another `i` (which is also 3).

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where mak is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on the input string)**
