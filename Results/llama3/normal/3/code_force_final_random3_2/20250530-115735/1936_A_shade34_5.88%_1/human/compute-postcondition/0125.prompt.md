Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is n, mak is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, mak2 is equal to mak, pans is an empty list, and the output buffer is flushed. The output buffer contains the string ? 0 0 1 1, and for each iteration of the loop, if the input string is '<', then ? [i] [i] [i] [i] is printed, otherwise ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i] is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, n is greater than 0, if the user input s is '<', then mak is 0, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, and pans is [0]. Otherwise, mak is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, mak2 is equal to mak, and pans is a list containing 0 if the user input s is '=', otherwise pans is an empty list. The output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 0, and s is a string input from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *i is 1, n is greater than 1, s is a string input from the user, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? 0 0 1 1. If the user input s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is [1]. If the user input s is not '<', then this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 1. If the user input s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, 1. If the user input s is not '=' or '<', then pans is a list containing 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program's output buffer is either empty or not empty. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is either 1 or 2 and `pans` is either [1] or [2]. If the user input `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing either 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2. If the user input `s` is neither '=' nor '<', then `pans` is a list containing either 1 or 1, 2, and the output buffer contains the string ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], and [i] is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
