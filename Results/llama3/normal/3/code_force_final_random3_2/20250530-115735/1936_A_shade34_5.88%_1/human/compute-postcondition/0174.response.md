The code prints a string that includes several variables: `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`. Based on the initial state, we can describe the values of these variables as follows:

*   `mak` is either a value from 0 to n-1.
*   `mak2` is either n-1 or a value less than n-1.
*   `i` is 0.

The print statement will output a string in the format '? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]', where the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` are inserted into the string.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] [0] [mak2] (where mak is a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1)**
