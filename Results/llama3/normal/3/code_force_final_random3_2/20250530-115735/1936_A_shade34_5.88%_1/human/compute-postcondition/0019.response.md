Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, then another `mak` which is 3, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3. Otherwise, `mak` is 3, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, then another `mak` which is 3, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, then another `mak` which is 3, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3 is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
