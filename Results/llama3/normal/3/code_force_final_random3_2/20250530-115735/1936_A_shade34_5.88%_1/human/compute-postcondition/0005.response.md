Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the output buffer is flushed**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1", which is now printed to the output stream. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` are not affected by this code, and the `stdin` remains empty.
