Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is n, mak is either a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The first line assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`, so `mak2` is now equal to `mak`. The second line initializes an empty list `pans`. No other variables are affected. The output buffer and printed strings remain the same as in the initial state.
