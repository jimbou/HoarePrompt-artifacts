Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<', the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? `[0]` `[mak2]` `[n-1]` `[mak2]`, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[mak]`, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed, meaning that any pending output is sent to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the same strings, but they are now flushed, meaning they are visible on the console.
