Postcondition: **i is 0, n is greater than 0, if the user input s is '<', then mak is 0, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, and pans is [0]. Otherwise, mak is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, mak2 is equal to mak, and pans is a list containing 0 if the user input s is '=', otherwise pans is an empty list. The output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 0, and s is a string input from the user.**
