Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]**
