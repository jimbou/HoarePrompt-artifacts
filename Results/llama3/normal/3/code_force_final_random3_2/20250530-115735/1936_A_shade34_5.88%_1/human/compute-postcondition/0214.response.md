Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `s` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]], and the output buffer is flushed. If the user's input is '>', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [2], and this is printed: ? [2] [2] [0] [0], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [2] [mak2] [0] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [2] [mak2] [1] [mak2], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], where pans[2] is the element at index 2 in the pans list, and pans[i] is the element at index i in the pans list, and the output buffer is flushed.**
