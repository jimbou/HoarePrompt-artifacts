Postcondition: ***i is 1, n is greater than 1, s is a string input from the user, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? 0 0 1 1. If the user input s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is [1]. If the user input s is not '<', then this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 1. If the user input s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, 1. If the user input s is not '=' or '<', then pans is a list containing 1.***
