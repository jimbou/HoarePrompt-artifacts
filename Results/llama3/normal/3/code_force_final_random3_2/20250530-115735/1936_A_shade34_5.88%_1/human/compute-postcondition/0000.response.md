The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `input()` and `range()` and `int()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() which is an integer. If the input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases). So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be greater than 0 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases) that must be greater than 0, _ is 0**
