Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, followed by '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, then another `mak` which is 2, then the value of `i` which is 2, and another `i` which is 2.**

The value of `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The output buffer is still flushed, and the same text is still printed. The new output is appended to the existing output.
