Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `n-1` `n-1` `n` `n`. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 1, then another `mak` which is 1, then the value of `i` which is 1, and another `i` which is 1. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 1, then another `mak` which is 1, then the value of `i` which is 1, and another `i` which is 1, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 1, then another `mak` which is 1, then the value of `i` which is 1, and another `i` which is 1 is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]` which is `pans[1]`, then another `pans[mak]` which is `pans[1]`, then the value of `pans[i]` which is `pans[1]`, and another `pans[i]` which is `pans[1]`. The output buffer is flushed. The current input is '>'**

The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
