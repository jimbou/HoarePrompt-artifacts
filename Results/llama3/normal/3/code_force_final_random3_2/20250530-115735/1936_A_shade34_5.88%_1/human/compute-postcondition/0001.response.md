The code snippet reads an integer from stdin, assigns it to `n`, and initializes a variable `mak` to 0. Since stdin initially contains one input, an integer greater than 0, after the execution of the code, stdin will be empty.

The value of `n` will be the integer read from stdin, and the value of `mak` will remain 0. The variable `_` is not affected by the code and remains 0.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, mak is 0, _ is 0, stdin is empty**
