Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, mak is 0, mak2 is n-1, pans is [0], the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? n-1 n-1 0 0. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak2 which is n-1, then the value of i which is 0, and another mak2 which is n-1, s is '<' if the input is '<', otherwise s is the input. The current value of s is '<'.**

The first line assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` is 0, `mak` becomes 0. The second line assigns a list containing the value of `i` to `pans`. Since `i` is 0, `pans` becomes [0]. No other variables are affected.
