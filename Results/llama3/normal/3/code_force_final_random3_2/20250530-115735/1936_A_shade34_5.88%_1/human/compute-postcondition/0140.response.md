To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `pans`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `pans`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `pans` has at least 3 elements.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The length of `pans` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 3, `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `mak` is either 0 or 1**
