Based on the precondition, the code prints a string that includes the elements of the `pans` list at specific indices.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this will print the first element of the `pans` list.
* `pans[mak]`: Again, since `mak` is 0, this will print the first element of the `pans` list (same as above).
* `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 1, this will print the second element of the `pans` list.
* `pans[i]`: Again, since `i` is 1, this will print the second element of the `pans` list (same as above).

So, the output will be a string containing the first element of the `pans` list twice, followed by the second element of the `pans` list twice.

Output: **[first element of pans], [first element of pans], [second element of pans], [second element of pans]**
