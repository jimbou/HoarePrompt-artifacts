The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and pans, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `pans`. If `i` is less than `len(pans)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `pans` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `pans` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 2, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements**
