Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that will be printed.

The print statement is: `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the values:

* `?`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `mak`: According to the precondition, `mak` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`. However, we can describe it as "either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`".
* `mak2`: Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, it will have the same value as `mak`, which is "either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`".
* `i`: According to the precondition, `i` is 0.
* `mak2` (again): This is the same as the previous `mak2`, so it will also be "either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`".

Putting it all together, the output will be:

Output: **? 0 (either n-1 or a value less than n-1) (either n-1 or a value less than n-1) 0 (either n-1 or a value less than n-1)**

Note that the exact value of `mak` and `mak2` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `n`.
