Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n. For each test case, it performs a series of queries to determine the maximum and second maximum values in a range from 1 to n. It then prints the second maximum value and the maximum value in the format '!, max, second_max'. The function repeats this process for all test cases and ensures that the output buffer is flushed after each test case.**
