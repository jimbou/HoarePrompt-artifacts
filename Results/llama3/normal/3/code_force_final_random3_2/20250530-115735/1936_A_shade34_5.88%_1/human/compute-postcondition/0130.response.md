Output State: **`i` is 1, `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]. The values of the variables `i`, `pans`, `mak`, and `mak2` are not affected by this code, so they remain the same.
