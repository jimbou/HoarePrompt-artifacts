Output State: **i is n-1, mak is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, mak2 is equal to mak, pans is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if all user inputs s are '=', otherwise pans is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 excluding the values for which the user input s is '<', and the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], and [i] is n-1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The loop counter `i` has reached its final value, which is `n-1`.
* The value of `mak` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, depending on the user inputs.
* The value of `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
* The list `pans` contains all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '='. If any user input `s` is '<', then the corresponding value is excluded from the list.
* The output buffer is flushed and contains the string `? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2]`, where `[mak]` is either `[n-1]` or a value less than `[n-1]`, `[mak2]` is equal to `[mak]`, and `[i]` is `n-1`.
