Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `mak` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing 0, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 0, `s` is a string input from the user, is not equal to '<', and is currently equal to '='**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains 0, and `n` is still greater than 0. The values of `mak` and `mak2` are unchanged, with `mak` being either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, and `mak2` being equal to `mak`. The list `pans` now contains the value 0, which was appended by the code. The output buffer and the printed string remain the same. The value of `s` is still a string input from the user, not equal to '<', and currently equal to '='.
