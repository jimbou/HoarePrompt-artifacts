Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` is not empty and contains the string '<', the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, the current value of `stdin` is '<'.**

The value of `mak` is updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the printed output remains the same. The stdin still contains the string '<'.
