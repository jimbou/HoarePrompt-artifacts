Based on the precondition, the print statement will print a string that starts with '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then the value of `mak2`, then the value of `i`, and finally the value of `mak2` again.

The value of `mak` is 0 if the input is '<', otherwise it is `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n-1` is a positive integer.

The value of `mak2` is always `n-1`, which is a positive integer.

The value of `i` is always 0.

Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with '?' followed by either 0 or `n-1`, then `n-1`, then 0, and finally `n-1` again.

Output: **? [0 or n-1] n-1 0 n-1 (where n-1 is a positive integer)**
