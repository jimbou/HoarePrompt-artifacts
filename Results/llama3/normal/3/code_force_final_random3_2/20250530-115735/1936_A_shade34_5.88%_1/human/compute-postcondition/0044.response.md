Output: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, if the input is '<', then mak is 1, mak2 is n-1, pans is [1], and s is '<'. Otherwise, mak is 0 if the input is '<', otherwise mak is n-1, mak2 is n-1, pans is a list of integers where the last element is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise the last element is 1, and s is '<' if the input is '<', otherwise s is the input. If s is '=', then pans has an additional element 0 or 1 and s is '='. The output buffer is flushed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak, then the value of i, and another i is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2 is printed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2 is printed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then the value of mak2, then the value of i, and the value of mak2 is printed.**
