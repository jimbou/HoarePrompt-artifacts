Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is 3, and the output "? 3 3 3 3" is printed and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer has been flushed, and the output "? 3 3 3 3" has been printed if `mak` is 3.
