Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<', and the output "? 0 0 2 2" is printed if `mak` is 0, or "? 1 1 2 2" is printed if `mak` is 1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer has been flushed, meaning that any pending output (in this case, the printed strings) has been sent to the output device. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged.
