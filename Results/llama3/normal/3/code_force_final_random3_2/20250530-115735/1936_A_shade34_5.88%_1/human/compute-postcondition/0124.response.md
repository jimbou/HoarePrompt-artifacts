Postcondition: **The program's output buffer is either empty or not empty. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is either 1 or 2 and `pans` is either [1] or [2]. If the user input `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing either 0, 1 or 0, 1, 2. If the user input `s` is neither '=' nor '<', then `pans` is a list containing either 1 or 1, 2, and the output buffer contains the string ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], and [i] is 2.**
