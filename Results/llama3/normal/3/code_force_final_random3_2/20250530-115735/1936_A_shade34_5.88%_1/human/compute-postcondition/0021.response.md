Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is n, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then mak is n-1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n. Otherwise, mak is n-1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the output buffer has been flushed. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, which means the loop has iterated `n-1` times. The value of `mak` is either `n-1` or `n-1`, depending on whether the input was '<' or not. The output buffer contains the printed strings from each iteration of the loop, with the last iteration printing the final values of `mak` and `i`.
