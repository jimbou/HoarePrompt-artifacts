The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, then another `mak` which is 2, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3. Otherwise, `mak` is 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 1, then another `mak` which is either 0 or 1, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3.**
