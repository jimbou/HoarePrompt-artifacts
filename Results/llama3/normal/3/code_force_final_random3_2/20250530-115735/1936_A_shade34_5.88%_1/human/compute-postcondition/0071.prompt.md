Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 0, i is n, mak is 0, mak2 is n-1, pans is a list of integers, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? n-1 n-1 n n. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1 if the input is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `n-1` `n-1` `n` `n`. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 2, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed. If the input is '>', then '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, and this is printed: '?' followed by the 1st or 2nd element of the list `pans` (depending on the value of `mak`), the 1st or 2nd element of the list `pans` (depending on the value of `mak`), the 3rd element of the list `pans`, and the 3rd element of the list `pans`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 2, and `mak2` is `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
