Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, mak is 1, mak2 is n-1, pans is [1], s is '<' if the input is '<', otherwise s is the input. If s is '=', then pans has an additional element 0 and s is '='.**

In this final state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The list `pans` now contains the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer has been flushed and printed as described in the initial state.
