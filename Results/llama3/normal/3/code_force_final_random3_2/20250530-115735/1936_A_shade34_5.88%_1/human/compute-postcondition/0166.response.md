The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak`, the value of `mak` again, the value of `i`, and the value of `i` again.
The value of `mak` depends on the user input `s`. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 2. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1.
The value of `i` is 3.
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 3 3 (where [mak] is either 0, 1, or 2, depending on the user input s)**
