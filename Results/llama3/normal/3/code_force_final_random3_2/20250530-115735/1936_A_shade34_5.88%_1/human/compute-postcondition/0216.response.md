Based on the precondition, the code prints a formatted string containing elements from the `pans` list.

The value of `mak` is either 0, 1, or 2, and the value of `i` is 3.

The `print` statement will output the string '?' followed by the elements at indices `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i` in the `pans` list.

Since the exact values of `mak` and the elements in the `pans` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the output.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the formatted string containing the elements from the `pans` list.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[mak] is the element at index mak in the pans list, and pans[i] is the element at index i in the pans list)**
