Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string input from the user, the output buffer is not empty, if the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `pans` is [1, 2]. If the user input `s` is not '<', then this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 2. If the user input `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing 0, 1, 2. If the user input `s` is not '=' or '<', then `pans` is a list containing 1, 2, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains the same, which is 2. The value of `n` is still greater than 2. The value of `s` is still a string input from the user. The output buffer is not empty because some values are printed. The value of `pans` is updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. The rest of the conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
