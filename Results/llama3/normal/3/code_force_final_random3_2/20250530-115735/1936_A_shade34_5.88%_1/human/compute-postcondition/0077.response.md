To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements**
