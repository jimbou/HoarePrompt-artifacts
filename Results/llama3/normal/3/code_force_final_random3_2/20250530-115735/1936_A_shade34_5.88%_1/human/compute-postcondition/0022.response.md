If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.**
