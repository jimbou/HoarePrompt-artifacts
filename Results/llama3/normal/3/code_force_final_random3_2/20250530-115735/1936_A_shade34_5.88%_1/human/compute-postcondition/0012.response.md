Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, `_` is 0, and `stdin` is not empty and contains the string '<'. Otherwise, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, and `stdin` is empty, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 1, then another `mak` which is either 0 or 1, then the value of `i` which is 2, and another `i` which is 2.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1". After flushing the output buffer, the output buffer is empty. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, and `_` are not affected by this code. The state of the input buffer (`stdin`) is also not affected.
