To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the starting value of the range) and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mak` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list, and the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? 0 0 1 1**
