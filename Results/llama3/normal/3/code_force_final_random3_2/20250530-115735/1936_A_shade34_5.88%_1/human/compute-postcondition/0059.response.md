The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and pans, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and pans. If i is less than len(pans), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, pans has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again pans must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `n-1` `n-1` `n` `n`. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed.**
