Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and if the input string is '<', then ? [1] [1] [2] [2] is printed, otherwise ? [0] [0] [2] [2] is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
