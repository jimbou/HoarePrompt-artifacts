To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will execute for `i` values from 1 to `n-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an integer greater than 1
* `i` is 1
* `mak` is either 0 or 1
* `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`
* `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, since that's what the loop head does. Therefore:

* `i` becomes 2

The other variables (`n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'**
