Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call has flushed the output buffer, ensuring that the printed message "? 0 0 1 1" is displayed immediately. The output buffer is now empty, and the program is ready to continue executing.
