Output State: **i is 2, n is greater than 2, s is a string input from the user, the output buffer is empty, if the user input s is '<', then mak is 2 and pans is [2]. If the user input s is not '<', then this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 2. If the user input s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0, 1. If the user input s is not '=' or '<', then pans is a list containing 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 2.**

In this final state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and `n` is still greater than 2. The user input `s` remains the same, and the output buffer is still empty. The values of `mak` and `pans` are updated based on the user input `s`. If `s` is '<', then `mak` becomes 2 and `pans` becomes [2]. If `s` is not '<', then the output buffer contains the string ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], and [i] is 2. If `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing 0, 1. If `s` is not '=' or '<', then `pans` is a list containing 1.
