Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and if the input string is '<', then ? [1] [1] [2] [2] is printed, otherwise ? [0] [0] [2] [2] is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged. The output buffer is flushed, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output device. The initial print statement ? 0 0 1 1 is executed, and then the second print statement is executed based on the value of `mak`. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 1, and ? [1] [1] [2] [2] is printed. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0, and ? [0] [0] [2] [2] is printed.
