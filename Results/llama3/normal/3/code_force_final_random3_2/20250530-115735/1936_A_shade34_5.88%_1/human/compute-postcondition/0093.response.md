Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and if the input string is '<', then ? [1] [1] [2] [2] is printed, otherwise ? [0] [0] [2] [2] is printed. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is `n-1`, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1 and `mak2` is `n-1`, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]. The output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the previously printed strings, and flushing it does not change the values of any variables. The output state remains the same, with the addition that the output buffer is now empty.
