Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-1`, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `s` is a string containing the user's input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `mak` is reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the same strings, and the list `pans` still contains `n-1`. The value of `mak2` can be either `n-1` or less than `n-1`, and the value of `i` is still `n`. The user's input is still stored in the string `s`.
