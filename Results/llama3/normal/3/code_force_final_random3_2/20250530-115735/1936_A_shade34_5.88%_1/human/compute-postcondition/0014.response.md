Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, then another `mak` which is 2, then the value of `i` which is 2, and another `i` which is 2. Otherwise, `mak` is 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 1, then another `mak` which is either 0 or 1, then the value of `i` which is 2, and another `i` which is 2.***
