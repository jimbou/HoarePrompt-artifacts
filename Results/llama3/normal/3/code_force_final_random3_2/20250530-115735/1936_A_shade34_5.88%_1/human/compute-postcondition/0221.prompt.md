Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-1`, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `s` is a string containing the user's input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `s` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]], and the output buffer is flushed. If the user's input is '>', then `mak` is 1, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [1], and this is printed: ? [1] [1] [0] [0], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [1] [mak2] [0] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [1] [mak2] [1] [mak2], and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1 or 2, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing at least 3 elements, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `s` is a string containing the user's input, and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]], and the output buffer is flushed. If the user's input is '>', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: ! [mak2] [2], and this is printed: ? [2] [2] [0] [0], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [2] [mak2] [0] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [2] [mak2] [1] [mak2], and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]], where pans[2] is the element at index 2 in the pans list, and pans[i] is the element at index i in the pans list, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The output buffer is flushed. If the user input is '>', then `mak` is assigned the value of `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
