Output State: **i is 0, n is greater than 0, mak is 0, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, pans is [0], the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is 0, [mak2] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [i] is 0, s is '<'.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, which is the current value of `i`. The value of `pans` has also been updated to `[0]`, which is a list containing the current value of `i`. The values of `n`, `mak2`, and `s` remain unchanged. The output buffer and the printed string also remain the same.
