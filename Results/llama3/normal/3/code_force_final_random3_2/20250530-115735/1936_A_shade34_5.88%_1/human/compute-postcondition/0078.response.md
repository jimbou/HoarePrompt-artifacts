Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `mak` is 0
* `mak` is printed again, still 0
* `i` is 1
* `i` is printed again, still 1

The print statement is printing a string with four placeholders, which are filled with the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i` respectively.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
