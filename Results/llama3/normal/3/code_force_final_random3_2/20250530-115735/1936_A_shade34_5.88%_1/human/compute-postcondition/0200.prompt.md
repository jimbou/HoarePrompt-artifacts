Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, i is n, mak is either a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than 1, i is 0, mak is either 0 or a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, pans is a list, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], s is a string containing the user's input. If s is '<', then mak is 0 and pans is [0]. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then pans is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, mak is either 0 or a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], s is a string containing the user's input. If s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is a list containing 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then mak is either 0 or a value from 0 to n-1 and pans is a list containing i.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, mak is either 0 or a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, s is a string containing the user's input. If s equals '<', then mak is 2. If s equals '=', then pans is a list containing the value 2. The output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
