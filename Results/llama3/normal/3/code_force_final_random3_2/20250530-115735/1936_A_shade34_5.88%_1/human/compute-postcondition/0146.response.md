Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<', and the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` has reached the second last element of the list `pans`, the variable `mak` has been updated to the index of the last element in `pans`, and the list `pans` remains unchanged. The output buffer contains the string ? followed by the 0th element of `pans` twice, and the last element of `pans` twice, and has been flushed.
