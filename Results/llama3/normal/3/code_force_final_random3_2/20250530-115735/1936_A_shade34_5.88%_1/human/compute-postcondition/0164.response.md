Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1, and the output "? 0 0 2 2" is printed if `mak` is 0, or "? 1 1 2 2" is printed if `mak` is 1, and the output buffer is flushed.***
