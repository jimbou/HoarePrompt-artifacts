Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is the input, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then mak is 2, pans is [2], and the output buffer contains the value of 2 repeated eight times. If s is '=', then the output buffer contains the value of mak, then another mak, then the value of i, and another i, followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2, followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2, followed by the value of mak, then the value of mak2, then the value of i, the value of mak2, and the value of i. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the output buffer remains the same as before the if else block.***
