Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, and '?' followed by the 0th or 1st element of the list `pans` twice, and the 3rd element of the list `pans` twice has been printed to the console and the buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', then `mak` is 3; otherwise, `mak` remains either 0 or 1.**
