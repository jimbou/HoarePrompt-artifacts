Based on the precondition, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `n` is greater than 2 (not directly relevant to the print statement)
* `i` is 2
* The output buffer is flushed (not directly relevant to the print statement)
* The input is '<', which means:
	+ `mak` is 1
	+ `_` is 0 (not used in the print statement)
	+ `stdin` is not empty and contains the string '<' (not directly relevant to the print statement)

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', mak, mak, i, i)`

The print statement will output:

* '?' (a literal string)
* `mak` (which is 1)
* `mak` again (which is 1)
* `i` (which is 2)
* `i` again (which is 2)

So, the output will be:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
