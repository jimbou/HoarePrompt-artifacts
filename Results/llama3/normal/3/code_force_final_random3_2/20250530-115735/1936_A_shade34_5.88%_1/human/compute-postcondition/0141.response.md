The code prints a string containing four elements from the `pans` list. The first two elements are the same and are located at index `mak` in the `pans` list. The last two elements are the same and are located at index `i` in the `pans` list.

Since `mak` is either 0 or 1, the first two elements will be either the first element of the `pans` list or the second element of the `pans` list.

Since `i` is 3, the last two elements will be the fourth element of the `pans` list.

Output: **?, [pans[mak]], [pans[mak]], [pans[3]], [pans[3]] (where [pans[mak]] is either the first or second element of the pans list, and [pans[3]] is the fourth element of the pans list)**
