According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0.**
