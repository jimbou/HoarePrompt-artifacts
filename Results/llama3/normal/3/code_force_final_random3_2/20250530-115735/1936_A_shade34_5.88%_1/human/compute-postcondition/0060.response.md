Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The variable `mak` is 1 if the input is '>', otherwise it is 0. Since the input is not specified, we will consider both cases.

The variable `i` is 2.

The list `pans` has at least 3 elements, but the exact elements are not specified.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`

If `mak` is 1 (input is '>'), then:

* `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]`, which is the second element of the `pans` list.
* `pans[i]` is `pans[2]`, which is the third element of the `pans` list.

If `mak` is 0 (input is not '>'), then:

* `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`, which is the first element of the `pans` list.
* `pans[i]` is still `pans[2]`, which is the third element of the `pans` list.

In both cases, the print statement will output a string starting with '?' followed by the value of `pans[mak]` twice, and the value of `pans[i]` twice.

Since the exact elements of the `pans` list are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, we can describe the output as:

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]] (where pans[mak] is the element of the pans list at index mak, and pans[i] is the element of the pans list at index i)**
