Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 1, i is n-1, mak is 0, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, pans is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if all user inputs s are '=', otherwise pans is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 excluding the values for which the user input s is '<', the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0. The output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? `[0]` `[mak2]` `[n-1]` `[mak2]`, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[mak]`, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1, and the output "? 0 0 2 2" is printed if `mak` is 0, or "? 1 1 2 2" is printed if `mak` is 1, and the output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the output "? `mak` `mak` 3 3" is printed and the output buffer is flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
