Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 1, i is 0, mak is either a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, pans is a list, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], s is a string containing the user's input, and s is either '=' or not '<'. If s is '=', then pans is a list containing 0. Otherwise, pans is an empty list.***
