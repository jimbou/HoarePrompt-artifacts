The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mak` repeated twice, and the value of `i` repeated twice. 

Since `mak` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is 2, the output will be one of two possibilities: 

If `mak` is 0, the output will be: **? 0 0 2 2**

If `mak` is 1, the output will be: **? 1 1 2 2**

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 2 (where mak is either 0 or 1)**
