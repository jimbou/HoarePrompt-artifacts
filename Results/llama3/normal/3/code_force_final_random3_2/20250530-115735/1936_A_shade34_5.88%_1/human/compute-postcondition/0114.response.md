Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string input from the user, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2] where [mak] is either [n-1] or a value less than [n-1], [mak2] is equal to [mak], [i] is 1, and if the user input s is '<', then mak is 0, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, and pans is [0, 1]. Otherwise, mak is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, mak2 is equal to mak, and pans is a list containing 0, 1 if the user input s is '=', otherwise pans is a list containing 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains the same, which is 1. The value of `n` is still greater than 1. The string `s` is still the input from the user. The output buffer and the printed string remain the same. The only change is in the value of `pans`. If the user input `s` is '<', then `pans` is now a list containing 0 and 1. If the user input `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing 0 and 1. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing only 1.
