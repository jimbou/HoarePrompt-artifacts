Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the following:

The string '!', followed by the value of `mak2`, which is `n-1`, and then the value of `mak`, which is also `n-1`.

Since `n` is greater than 0, `n-1` will be a positive integer. However, the exact value of `n-1` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **!(n-1)(n-1) (where n-1 is the value of n-1)**
