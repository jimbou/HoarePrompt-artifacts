Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the output "? `mak` `mak` 3 3" is printed and the output buffer is flushed.***
