Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to its original value, i is n, mak is 0, mak2 is n-1, pans is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of pans[mak] which is pans[0], then another pans[mak] which is pans[0], then the value of pans[i] which is pans[n], and another pans[i] which is pans[n]. The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of mak2 which is n-1, and the value of mak which is 0. The output buffer is flushed again.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '<':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and the output buffer is flushed. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and if the input string is '<', then ? [1] [1] [2] [2] is printed, otherwise ? [0] [0] [2] [2] is printed. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is `n-1`, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1 and `mak2` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and if the input string is '<', then ? [1] [1] [2] [2] is printed, otherwise ? [0] [0] [2] [2] is printed. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is `n-1`, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1 and `mak2` is `n-1`. If the input string is '<', then ? [3] [3] [3] [3] is printed, otherwise nothing is printed. The output buffer is flushed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
