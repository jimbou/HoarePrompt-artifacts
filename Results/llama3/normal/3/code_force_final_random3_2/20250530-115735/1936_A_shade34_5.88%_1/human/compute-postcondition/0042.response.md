The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, if the input is '<', then mak is 1, mak2 is n-1, pans is [1], and s is '<'. Otherwise, mak is 0 if the input is '<', otherwise mak is n-1, mak2 is n-1, pans is a list of integers where the last element is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise the last element is 1, and s is '<' if the input is '<', otherwise s is the input. If s is '=', then pans has an additional element 0 or 1 and s is '='. The output buffer is flushed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak, then the value of i, and another i is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2 is printed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2 is printed.**
