Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is n, mak is n-1, mak2 is n-1, pans is a list of integers, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? n-1 n-1 n n. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final values. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times. The value of `mak` is `n-1`, and the value of `mak2` is also `n-1`. The list `pans` contains a sequence of integers that were appended during the loop iterations. The output buffer is flushed, and the final output is printed, which includes the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `n`. If the input is '<', the output is a single line with the values of `mak` and `i`. Otherwise, the output is two lines with the values of `mak` and `i`.
