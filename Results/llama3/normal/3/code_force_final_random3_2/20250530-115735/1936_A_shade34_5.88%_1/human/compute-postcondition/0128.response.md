Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that are printed.

The code prints a string that starts with '?' and is followed by the elements of the `pans` list at specific indices.

- `pans[mak]` is printed twice, where `mak` is 0. So, `pans[mak]` is the first element of the `pans` list.
- `pans[i]` is printed twice, where `i` is 1. So, `pans[i]` is the second element of the `pans` list.

Output: **? [first element of pans] [first element of pans] [second element of pans] [second element of pans]**
