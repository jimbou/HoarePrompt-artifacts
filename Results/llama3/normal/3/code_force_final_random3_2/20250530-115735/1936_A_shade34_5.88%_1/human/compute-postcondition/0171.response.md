Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is n, mak is either a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, pans is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 if all user inputs s are '=', otherwise pans is a list containing all values from 0 to n-1 excluding the values for which the user input s is '<', the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains unchanged, which is an integer greater than 1.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times.
* The value of `mak` can be any value from 0 to `n-1`, depending on the user inputs during the loop iterations.
* The value of `mak2` remains either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, unchanged from the initial state.
* The list `pans` contains all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise it contains all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'.
* The output buffer is flushed and contains the initial string ? `[0]` `[mak2]` `[n-1]` `[mak2]`, followed by the string ! `[mak2]` `[mak]`, and then the strings ? `[mak]` `[mak]` `[i-1]` `[i-1]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times.
