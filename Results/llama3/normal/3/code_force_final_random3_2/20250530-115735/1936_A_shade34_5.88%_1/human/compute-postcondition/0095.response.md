Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and if the input string is '<', then ? [1] [1] [2] [2] is printed, otherwise ? [0] [0] [2] [2] is printed. If the input string is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is `n-1`, otherwise `mak` is either 0 or 1 and `mak2` is `n-1`. If the input string is '<', then ? [3] [3] [3] [3] is printed, otherwise nothing is printed. The output buffer is flushed.***
