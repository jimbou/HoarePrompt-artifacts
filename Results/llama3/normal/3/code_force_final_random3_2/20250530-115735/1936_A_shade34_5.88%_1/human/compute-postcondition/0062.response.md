Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the input is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `n-1` `n-1` `n` `n`. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` only flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output device. It does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program in any way. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed.
