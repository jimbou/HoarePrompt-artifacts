Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, then another `mak` which is 2, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3. Otherwise, `mak` is 0 or 1, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0 or 1, then another `mak` which is either 0 or 1, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is either 0, 1 or 2, then another `mak` which is either 0, 1 or 2, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3 is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any buffered output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 1 1" and additional strings depending on the input. The flushing of the output buffer does not change the values of the variables `n` and `i`, but it ensures that the output is immediately visible.
