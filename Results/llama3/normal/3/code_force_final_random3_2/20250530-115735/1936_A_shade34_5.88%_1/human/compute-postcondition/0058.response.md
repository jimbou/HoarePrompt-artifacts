Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1 if the input is '>', otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `n-1` `n-1` `n` `n`. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed.***
