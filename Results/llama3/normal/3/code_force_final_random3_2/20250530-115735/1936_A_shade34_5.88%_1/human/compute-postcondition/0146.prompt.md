Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<', and the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. The output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 1 and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]. The output buffer is flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, and '?' followed by the 0th or 1st element of the list `pans` twice, and the 3rd element of the list `pans` twice has been printed to the console and the buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', then `mak` is 3; otherwise, `mak` remains either 0 or 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
