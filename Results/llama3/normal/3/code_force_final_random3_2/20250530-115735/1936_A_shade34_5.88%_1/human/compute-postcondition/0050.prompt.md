Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is greater than 0, i is n, mak is n-1, mak2 is n-1, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 0, i is 0, mak is 0 if the input is '<', otherwise mak is n-1, mak2 is n-1, pans is [0] if the input is '<', otherwise pans is a list of integers, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? n-1 n-1 0 0. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0 is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0 if the input is '<', otherwise mak is n-1, then another mak2 which is n-1, then the value of i which is 0, and another mak2 which is n-1, s is '<' if the input is '<', otherwise s is the input. If s is '=', then pans has an additional element 0 and s is '='.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 1, i is 1, if the input is '<', then mak is 1, mak2 is n-1, pans is [1], and s is '<'. Otherwise, mak is 0 if the input is '<', otherwise mak is n-1, mak2 is n-1, pans is a list of integers where the last element is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise the last element is 1, and s is '<' if the input is '<', otherwise s is the input. If s is '=', then pans has an additional element 0 or 1 and s is '='. The output buffer is flushed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak, then the value of i, and another i is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2 is printed, and '?' followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is the input, stdin is empty. If s is '<', then mak is 2, pans is [2], and the output buffer contains the value of 2 repeated eight times. If s is '=', then the output buffer contains the value of mak, then another mak, then the value of i, and another i, followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2, followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2, followed by the value of mak, then the value of mak2, then the value of i, the value of mak2, and the value of i. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then the output buffer remains the same as before the if else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
