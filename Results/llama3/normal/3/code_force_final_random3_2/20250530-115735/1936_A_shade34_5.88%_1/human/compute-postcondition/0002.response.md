To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already a positive integer, we can focus on `i`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1, and `i` should be 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
