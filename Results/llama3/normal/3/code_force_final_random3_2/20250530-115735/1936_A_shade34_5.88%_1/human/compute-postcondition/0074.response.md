Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2` which is `n-1`, and the value of `mak` which is `n-1`. The output buffer is flushed again.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed again. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain unchanged. The output buffer is flushed again, but no new output is printed.
