Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

The print statement is: `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`

From the initial state, we know:

* `i` is 2
* `n` is greater than 2
* `s` is a string input from the user
* If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `pans` is [1]
* If `s` is not '<', then `mak` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`
* `mak2` is equal to `mak`
* If `s` is '=', then `pans` is a list containing 0, 1
* If `s` is not '=' or '<', then `pans` is a list containing 1

Since the user input `s` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak` and `mak2`. However, we can describe their values based on the conditions.

* If `s` is '<', then `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is also 1.
* If `s` is not '<', then `mak` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.

The value of `i` is 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output:

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 2 [mak2]**

where `[mak]` is either 1 (if `s` is '<') or a value less than `n-1` (if `s` is not '<'), and `[mak2]` is equal to `[mak]`.
