Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, and this is printed: '?' followed by the 1st or 2nd element of the list `pans` (depending on the value of `mak`), the 1st or 2nd element of the list `pans` (depending on the value of `mak`), the 3rd element of the list `pans`, and the 3rd element of the list `pans`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 3 and `mak2` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 2, and `mak2` is `n-1`.***
