Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? `n-1` `n-1` `n` `n`. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i`, and '?' followed by the value of `mak`, then another `mak`, then the value of `i`, and another `i` is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `i`. The rest of the variables and the output buffer remain unchanged.
