The code prints a string containing the characters '?' and the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`. Where `mak` is 0, and `i` is 1.
Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<', the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? `[0]` `[mak2]` `[n-1]` `[mak2]`, and this is printed: ! `[mak2]` `[mak]`, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1**
