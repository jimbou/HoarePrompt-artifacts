To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `i` is 1
* `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements

To execute the loop again, the condition `i < len(pans)` must be true. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to increment it to 2 for the loop to execute again. Additionally, the length of `pans` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

The other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, the output buffer, and the printed string) are not directly related to the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0.**
