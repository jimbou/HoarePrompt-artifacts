Output State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements, `mak` is either 0 or 1, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]. The output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed. This means that any pending output in the buffer is sent to the output device, but the values of the variables `i`, `pans`, `mak`, and `mak2` remain unchanged. The output buffer is now empty.
