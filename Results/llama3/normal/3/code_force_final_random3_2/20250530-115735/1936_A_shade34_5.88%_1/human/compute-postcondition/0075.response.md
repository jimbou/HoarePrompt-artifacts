State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `pans[mak]`, then another `pans[mak]`, then the value of `pans[i]`, and another `pans[i]`. The output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '!' followed by the value of `mak2` which is `n-1`, and the value of `mak` which is `n-1`. The output buffer is flushed again.**
