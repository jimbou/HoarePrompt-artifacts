Postcondition: **n is greater than 0, i is 0, mak is n-1, mak2 is n-1, pans is an empty list, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? n-1 n-1 0 0. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak which is n-1, then the value of i which is 0, and another i which is 0 is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of mak which is n-1, then another mak2 which is n-1, then the value of i which is 0, and another mak2 which is n-1, s is '<' if the input is '<', otherwise s is the input. The current value of s is '<'.**
