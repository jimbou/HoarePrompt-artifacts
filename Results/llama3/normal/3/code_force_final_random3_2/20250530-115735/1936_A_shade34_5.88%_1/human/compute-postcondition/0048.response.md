Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, s is the input, stdin is empty, and the output buffer contains the value of mak, then another mak, then the value of i, and another i, followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2, followed by the value of mak, then another mak2, then the value of i, and another mak2, followed by the value of mak, then the value of mak2, then the value of i, and the value of mak2, and the value of i if s is '='. Otherwise, the output buffer remains the same as before the if else block***
