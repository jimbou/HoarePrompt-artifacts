Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 0, `mak` is either a value from 0 to `n-1`, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 0, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], `s` is a string containing the user's input, and `s` is not '<', and the current value of `s` is '='**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` is appended to the list `pans`, which now contains the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer still contains the same strings, and the user's input `s` is still '='.
