Output: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is `n-1`, then another `mak` which is `n-1`, then the value of `i` which is 0, and another `i` which is 0. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is `n-1`, then another `mak` which is `n-1`, then the value of `i` which is 0, and another `i` which is 0, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is `n-1`, then another `mak` which is `n-1`, then the value of `i` which is 0, and another `i` which is 0 is printed, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is `n-1`, then another `mak2` which is `n-1`, then the value of `i` which is 0, and another `mak2` which is `n-1`**
