Output State: **`i` is 1, `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]. The current value of the input is '>'**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output buffer and the printed string also remain the same.
