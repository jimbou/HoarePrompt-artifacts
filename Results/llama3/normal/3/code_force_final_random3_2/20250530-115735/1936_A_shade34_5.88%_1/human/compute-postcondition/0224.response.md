Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the output buffer is flushed. The value of `mak` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was '>'. If the user input was never '>', then `mak` remains 0. The value of `i` is `n`, and this is printed: '!', the value of `mak2` and the value of `mak`. The output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the output buffer is flushed. The values of `mak`, `i`, and `mak2` remain the same, and the output buffer is cleared.
