Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `mak` is 3, `mak2` is either `n-1` if the input string is '<' or still `n-1` if the input string is not '<', the output buffer is flushed, and the following is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and if the input string is '<', then ? [1] [1] [2] [2] is printed, otherwise ? [0] [0] [2] [2] is printed, and ? [3] [3] [3] [3] is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The output buffer is still flushed, and the same messages are printed as before, with the addition of ? [3] [3] [3] [3] being printed.
