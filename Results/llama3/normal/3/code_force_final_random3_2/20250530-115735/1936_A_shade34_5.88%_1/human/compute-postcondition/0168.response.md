Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1, and the output "? 0 0 3 3" is printed if `mak` is 0, or "? 1 1 3 3" is printed if `mak` is 1, or "? 2 2 3 3" is printed if `mak` is 2, and the output buffer is flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, which means that any pending output is immediately written to the output stream. In this case, the output buffer contains the string "? 0 0 3 3", "? 1 1 3 3", or "? 2 2 3 3" depending on the value of `mak`. After flushing the output buffer, the output is immediately visible to the user. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `pans`, `mak`, and `mak2` remain unchanged.
