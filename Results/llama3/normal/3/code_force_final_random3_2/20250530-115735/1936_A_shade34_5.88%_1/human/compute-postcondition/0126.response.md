Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<', and the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2].**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 0, while the values of `i`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain the same as in the initial state. The output buffer still contains the string ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], but with the value of `mak` replaced by 0.
