Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 2, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 2, then another `mak` which is 2, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3. Otherwise, `mak` is 3, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, then another `mak` which is 3, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3, and '?' followed by the value of `mak` which is 3, then another `mak` which is 3, then the value of `i` which is 3, and another `i` which is 3 is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.**
