Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is n, mak is 0, mak2 is n-1, pans is a list of integers, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? n-1 n-1 n n. If the input is '<', then '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n. Otherwise, '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n, and '?' followed by the value of mak which is 0, then another mak which is 0, then the value of i which is n, and another i which is n is printed, and the output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been changed to 0, while the values of `n`, `i`, `mak2`, and `pans` remain the same. The output buffer is still flushed, and the printed output is updated to reflect the new value of `mak`.
