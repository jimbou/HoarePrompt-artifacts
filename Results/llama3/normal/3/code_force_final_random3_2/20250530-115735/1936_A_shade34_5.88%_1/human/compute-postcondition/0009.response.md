To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which is 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If the input is '<', then `mak` is 1, `_` is 0, and `stdin` is not empty and contains the string '<'. Otherwise, `mak` is 0, `_` is 0, and `stdin` is empty.**
