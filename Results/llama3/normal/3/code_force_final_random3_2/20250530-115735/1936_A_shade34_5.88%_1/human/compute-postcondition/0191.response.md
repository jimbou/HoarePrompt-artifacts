Postcondition: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, mak is either 0 or a value from 0 to n-1, mak2 is either n-1 or a value less than n-1, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ! [mak2] [mak], and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak] [i-1] [i-1] for all i from 1 to n-1, and the output buffer is flushed, and this is printed: ? [mak] [mak2] [i] [mak2], s is a string containing the user's input. If s is '<', then mak is 1 and pans is a list containing 1. If s is neither '<' nor '=', then mak is either 0 or a value from 0 to n-1 and pans is a list containing i.**
