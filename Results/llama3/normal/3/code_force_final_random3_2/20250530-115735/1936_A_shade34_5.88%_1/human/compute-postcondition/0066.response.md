To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. `n` is greater than 0: This information is not directly used in the print statement but indicates that `n` is a positive integer.

2. `i` is 3: This is used as an index in the list `pans`.

3. `mak` is 1 if the input is '<', otherwise `mak` is 2: Since the input condition is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `mak` based on this condition alone. However, we know it will be either 1 or 2.

4. `mak2` is `n-1`: This variable is not used in the print statement.

5. `pans` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements: Given that `i` is 3, and list indices start at 0, this ensures that `pans[i]` (or `pans[3]`) is a valid index.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

- `'?':` This will be printed as is.

- `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` can be either 1 or 2, this will print the second or third element of the `pans` list, respectively. Without knowing the exact value of `mak`, we can't specify which element is printed, but it will be either the second (`pans[1]`) or third (`pans[2]`) element.

- `pans[i]`: Given that `i` is 3, this will print the fourth element of the `pans` list (`pans[3]`).

Given the information, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **? [second or third element of pans] [second or third element of pans] [fourth element of pans] [fourth element of pans]**
