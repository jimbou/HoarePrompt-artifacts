The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` if all user inputs `s` are '=', otherwise `pans` is a list containing all values from 0 to `n-1` excluding the values for which the user input `s` is '<'. If the user input `s` is '<', then `mak` is 2 and `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`. Otherwise, `mak` is either 0 or 1, and the output "? 0 0 2 2" is printed if `mak` is 0, or "? 1 1 2 2" is printed if `mak` is 1, and the output buffer is flushed.**
