Output State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is either `n-1` or a value less than `n-1`, the output buffer is flushed and contains the string ? [0] [mak2] [n-1] [mak2], and this is printed: ? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]]. If the input is '>', then `mak` is 1, otherwise `mak` remains 0, and this is printed: ? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]. The output buffer is flushed.**

In this output state, the value of `mak` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
