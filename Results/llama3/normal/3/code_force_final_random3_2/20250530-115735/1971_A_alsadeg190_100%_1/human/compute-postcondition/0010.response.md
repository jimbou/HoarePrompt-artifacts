The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer between 0 and 9. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 9, `i` is 1, stdin contains x-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (1 <= x, y <= 9). If `x` is less than `y`, the current values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the value of `y` and the value of `x` (which is not less than `y`) are printed.**
