The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 and stdin contains x lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains x lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
