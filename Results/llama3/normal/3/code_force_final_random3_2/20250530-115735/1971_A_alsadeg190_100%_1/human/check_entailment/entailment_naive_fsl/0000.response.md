Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers x and y as input and outputs the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine which number is smaller and which is larger, and then prints them in the correct order.

The program also handles the case where x and y are equal, in which case it prints the same number twice. This is consistent with the problem description, which does not specify what to do in the case of equal numbers.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
