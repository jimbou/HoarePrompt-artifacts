The code prints the value of `y` and `x`. Since `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 9, the output will be two space-separated integers, where the first integer is the value of `y` and the second integer is the value of `x`. The exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the precondition, but they are within the range of 1 to 9.

Output: **[y] [x] (where y and x are integers between 1 and 9)**
