Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains x-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). If `x` is less than `y`, the current values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the value of `y` and the value of `x` (which is not less than `y`) are printed.***
