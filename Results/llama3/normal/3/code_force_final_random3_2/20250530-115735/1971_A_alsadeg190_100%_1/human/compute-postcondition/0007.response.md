The code prints the values of `y` and `x`, which are integers between 0 and 9. Since `x` is not less than `y`, we can conclude that `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. However, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y` without knowing the specific input from stdin.

Output: **y (an integer between 0 and 9), x (an integer between 0 and 9, where x is greater than or equal to y)**
