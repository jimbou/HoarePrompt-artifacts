Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains x lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if x < y:
        print(x, y)
    else:
        print(y, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is 0, stdin contains x-1 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9). If `x` is less than `y`, the current values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the value of `y` and the value of `x` (which is not less than `y`) are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 9, `i` is 1, stdin contains x-2 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (1 <= x, y <= 9). If `x` is less than `y`, the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the values of `y` and `x` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` and `y` are integers between 2 and 9, `i` is 2, stdin contains x-3 lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (2 <= x, y <= 9). If `x` is less than `y`, the values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the value of `y` and the value of `x` are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
