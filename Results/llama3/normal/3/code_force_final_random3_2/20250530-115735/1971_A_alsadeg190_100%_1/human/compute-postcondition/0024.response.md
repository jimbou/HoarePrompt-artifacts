Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is `x-1`, stdin is empty. If `x` is less than `y`, the current values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the value of `y` and the value of `x` (which is not less than `y`) are printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `x` and `y` will be between 0 and 9, and the value of `i` will be one less than the initial value of `x`. The stdin will be empty because all the lines will have been read. The loop will print the values of `x` and `y` in the correct order, with `x` first if it is less than `y`, and `y` first otherwise.
