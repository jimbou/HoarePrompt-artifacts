Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the first integer specifies the number of pairs to read. It then prints each pair in sorted order, with the smaller integer first.

The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine which integer is smaller and prints them in the correct order. The loop iterates over the number of test cases specified by the first integer, and for each test case, it reads two integers, compares them, and prints them in sorted order.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles cases where x is less than y, x is greater than y, and x is equal to y.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
