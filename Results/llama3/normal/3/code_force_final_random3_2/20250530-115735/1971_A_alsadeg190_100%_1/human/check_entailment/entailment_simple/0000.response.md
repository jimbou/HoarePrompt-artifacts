Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where it needs to output the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y. The program first reads an integer t, which represents the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads two integers x and y.

The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine which number is smaller and which is larger. If x is less than y, it prints x followed by y. Otherwise, it prints y followed by x. This logic is correct because it correctly identifies and prints the minimum and maximum values of x and y.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
