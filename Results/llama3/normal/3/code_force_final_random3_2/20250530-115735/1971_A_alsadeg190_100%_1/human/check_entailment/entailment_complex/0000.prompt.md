Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 9, `i` is `x-1`, stdin is empty. If `x` is less than `y`, the current values of `x` and `y` are printed. Otherwise, the value of `y` and the value of `x` (which is not less than `y`) are printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the first integer specifies the number of pairs to read. It then prints each pair in sorted order, with the smaller integer first. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to output the sorted pairs to the console.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
