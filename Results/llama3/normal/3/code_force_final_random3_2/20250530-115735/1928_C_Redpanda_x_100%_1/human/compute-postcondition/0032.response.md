Postcondition: ***`primes` is a list of prime numbers, `factors` is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is less than the length of `primes`, `rest` is an empty list, `prime` is the kth prime number in the list `primes`, `factor` is the last element in the list generated by `generate(k + 1)`, and `prime_to_i` is the product of all elements in the list generated by `generate(k + 1)` each multiplied by the kth prime number in the list `primes` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`.***
