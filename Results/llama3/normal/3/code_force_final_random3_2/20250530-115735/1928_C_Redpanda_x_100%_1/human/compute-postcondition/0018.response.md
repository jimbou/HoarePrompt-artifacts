Output State: **primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a value generated by generate(k + 1) that must have at least 2 elements, prime is the kth prime number in the list primes, factor is the second element in rest, prime_to_i is prime squared, factors[prime] is at least 1, _ is the product of factor and prime.**

In this output state, the values of `primes`, `factors`, `k`, `rest`, `prime`, and `factor` remain unchanged. The value of `prime_to_i` is updated to be the square of the original `prime` value, as it is multiplied by `prime` in the second line of code. The value of `_` is updated to be the product of `factor` and the original `prime` value, as it is assigned the result of `factor * prime_to_i` in the first line of code.
