Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a value generated by generate(k + 1), and prime is the kth prime number in the list primes
Code of the loop:
for factor in rest:
    prime_to_i = 1
    for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
        yield factor * prime_to_i
        prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a value generated by generate(k + 1) that must have at least 1 element, prime is the kth prime number in the list primes, factor is the first element in rest, prime_to_i is the kth prime number in the list primes raised to the power of factors[prime] + 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a value generated by generate(k + 1) that must have at least 2 elements, prime is the kth prime number in the list primes, factor is the second element in rest, prime_to_i is prime to the power of factors[prime] + 1, factors[prime] is at least 0, _ is the product of factor and prime to the power of factors[prime].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a value generated by generate(k + 1) that must have at least 1 element, prime is the kth prime number in the list primes, factor is the third element in rest, prime_to_i is the product of prime and the previous value of prime_to_i multiplied by prime to the power of factors[prime], factors[prime] is 0, _ is the product of factor and prime to the power of the previous value of factors[prime].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
