Output State: **`primes` is a list of prime numbers, `factors` is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, `k` is a non-negative integer equal to the length of `primes`, and the value 1 has been yielded.**

In this output state, the values of `primes`, `factors`, and `k` remain unchanged, as the code only contains a `yield` statement that returns the value 1. The `yield` statement does not modify any variables, but rather produces a value that can be used by the caller. The state of the program is updated to reflect that the value 1 has been yielded.
