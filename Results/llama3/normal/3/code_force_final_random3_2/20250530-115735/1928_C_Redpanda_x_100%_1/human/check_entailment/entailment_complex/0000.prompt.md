Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.

        while nn % i == 0:

    #State: n is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by the product of all its prime factors to their respective powers, factors is a dictionary with keys equal to all the prime factors of the original value of n and values equal to their respective powers, nn is 1, and i is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original value of n.
    if (nn > 1) :

    #State: *n is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by the product of all its prime factors to their respective powers, factors is a dictionary with keys equal to all the prime factors of the original value of n and values equal to their respective powers, if nn is greater than 1, then nn is a key in the factors dictionary with a value one more than its previous value, otherwise, nn remains 1, and i is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original value of n.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by the product of all its prime factors to their respective powers, `factors` is a dictionary with keys equal to all the prime factors of the original value of `n` and values equal to their respective powers, if `n` is greater than 1, then `n` is a key in the `factors` dictionary with a value one more than its previous value, otherwise, `n` remains 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original value of `n`, `primes` is a list of all the prime factors of the original value of `n`, and the value `factor` has been yielded and returned, `factor` is the last value yielded by `generate(0)` and has been yielded.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a generator that yields all prime factors of `n`. The function first calculates the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, then yields each prime factor. The input `n` is modified to be its original value divided by the product of all its prime factors to their respective powers. The function also returns a dictionary `factors` containing the prime factors and their powers, and a list `primes` of all prime factors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes).
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is an empty list, prime is the kth prime number in the list primes, factor is the last element in the list generated by generate(k + 1), prime_to_i is the product of all elements in the list generated by generate(k + 1) each multiplied by the kth prime number in the list primes raised to the power of factors[prime] + 1.
    #State: *`primes` is a list of prime numbers, `factors` is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the value 1 has been yielded. Otherwise, `k` is less than the length of `primes`, `rest` is an empty list, `prime` is the kth prime number in the list `primes`, `factor` is the last element in the list generated by `generate(k + 1)`, and `prime_to_i` is the product of all elements in the list generated by `generate(k + 1)` each multiplied by the kth prime number in the list `primes` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a sequence of numbers by recursively multiplying prime numbers with their powers, yielding a product for each combination of prime numbers and their powers, and returns 1 when the input index k is equal to the length of the list of prime numbers.
