Correctness: **False**.

The program is trying to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints, but it does not correctly implement the logic to find these values of k.

The problem description states that the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions, but the program does not take this into account. It only generates factors of the position n, but it does not check if these factors satisfy the condition of the settling.

For example, if n = 10 and x = 2, the program will generate factors 2 and 5, but it will not check if these factors satisfy the condition of the settling. In this case, only k = 2, 3, 5, 6 satisfy the condition, but the program will not find these values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
