Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by the product of all its prime factors to their respective powers, `factors` is a dictionary with keys equal to all the prime factors of the original value of `n` and values equal to their respective powers, if `n` is greater than 1, then `n` is a key in the `factors` dictionary with a value one more than its previous value, otherwise, `n` remains 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original value of `n`, and `primes` is a list of all the prime factors of the original value of `n`.
Code of the loop:
for factor in generate(0):
    yield factor


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by the product of all its prime factors to their respective powers, `factors` is a dictionary with keys equal to all the prime factors of the original value of `n` and values equal to their respective powers, if `n` is greater than 1, then `n` is a key in the `factors` dictionary with a value one more than its previous value, otherwise, `n` remains 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original value of `n`, `primes` is a list of all the prime factors of the original value of `n`, `factor` is the first value returned by `generate(0)`, and the value `factor` has been yielded.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by the product of all its prime factors to their respective powers, `factors` is a dictionary with keys equal to all the prime factors of the original value of `n` and values equal to their respective powers, if `n` is greater than 1, then `n` is a key in the `factors` dictionary with a value one more than its previous value, otherwise, `n` remains 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original value of `n`, `primes` is a list of all the prime factors of the original value of `n`, and the value `factor` has been yielded and returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by the product of all its prime factors to their respective powers, `factors` is a dictionary with keys equal to all the prime factors of the original value of `n` and values equal to their respective powers, if `n` is greater than 1, then `n` is a key in the `factors` dictionary with a value one more than its previous value, otherwise, `n` remains 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original value of `n`, `primes` is a list of all the prime factors of the original value of `n`, and the value `factor` has been yielded and returned, `factor` is the next value yielded by `generate(0)` and has been yielded.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
