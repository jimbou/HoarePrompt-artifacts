To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.


The loop head is `for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the state. However, we can infer that the loop variable is an integer that takes values from 0 to `factors[prime]`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `factors[prime]` is at least 0, and the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute again, the loop variable `_` must be incremented by 1.


Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can only adjust the state of `factors[prime]`. If `factors[prime]` is at least 1, the loop can execute again.


State: **primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers such that factors[prime] is at least 1, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a value generated by generate(k + 1) that must have at least 1 element, prime is the kth prime number in the list primes, factor is the first element in rest, prime_to_i is the kth prime number in the list primes**
