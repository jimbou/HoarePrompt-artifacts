Output State: **primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary mapping prime numbers to their powers, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), rest is a value generated by generate(k + 1) that must have at least 2 elements, prime is the kth prime number in the list primes, factor is the second element in rest, prime_to_i is the cube of prime, factors[prime] is at least 1, _ is the product of factor and prime squared plus 1.**

The code first yields the product of factor and prime squared, then updates prime_to_i to be the cube of prime. The value of prime_to_i is now the cube of prime, and the value of _ is the product of factor and prime squared plus 1. No other variables are affected.
