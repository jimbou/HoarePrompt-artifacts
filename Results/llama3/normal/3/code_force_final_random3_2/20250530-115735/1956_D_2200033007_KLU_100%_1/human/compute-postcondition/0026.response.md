Output State: **`i` is at least 1, `j` is `start_index + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is `i` and `arr[start_index + 1]` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `arr[j]` has been updated to `i`, where `j` is `start_index + 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now has `i` at both `start_index` and `start_index + 1`. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
