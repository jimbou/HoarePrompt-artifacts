This function takes a list of non-negative integers and two indices, start_index and end_index, as input. It returns an empty list if the subarray from start_index to end_index has a length of 1 and the value at start_index is 0. If the maximum value in the subarray is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, it returns a list containing a tuple (start_index, end_index). Otherwise, it recursively searches for a subarray that meets the condition and returns the sum of the results of func_2 for the subarrays from start_index to i-1 and from i+1 to end_index if found. If no such subarray is found, no action is taken.
