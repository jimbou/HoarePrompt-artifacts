Output State: **`i` is at least 0, `j` is `start_index + i`, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with argument `i - 1` and its return value has been returned.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decreased by 1, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the new value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The function call has returned a value, which is included in the output state.
