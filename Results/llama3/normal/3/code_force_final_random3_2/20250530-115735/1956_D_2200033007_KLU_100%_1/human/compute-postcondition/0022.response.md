Output State: **i is at least 1, j is i, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, res is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, is_already_stairs is False, and arr[start_index + i] is not equal to i.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line, `make_stairs(i - 1)`, calls a function `make_stairs` with the argument `i - 1`. The effect of this line depends on the implementation of the `make_stairs` function, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact impact of this line on the program state.

The second line, `res.append((start_index, start_index + i))`, appends a tuple containing `start_index` and `start_index + i` to the list `res`. This line modifies the state of the `res` variable by adding a new element to the list.

Since the implementation of the `make_stairs` function is not provided, we cannot determine the exact impact of the first line on the program state. Therefore, we can only conclude that the state of the `res` variable is modified by the second line, and the other variables remain unchanged.

In summary, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new element to the `res` list. The `i`, `j`, `arr`, `start_index`, `is_already_stairs`, and `arr[start_index + i]` variables remain unchanged.
