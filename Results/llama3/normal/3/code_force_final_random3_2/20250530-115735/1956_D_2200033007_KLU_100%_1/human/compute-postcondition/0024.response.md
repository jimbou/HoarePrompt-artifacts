Output State: **`i` is at least 1, `j` is `start_index`, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`**

In this output state, the value of `arr[start_index]` has been updated to `i`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` now has its element at index `start_index` set to `i`, and all other conditions and relationships between variables remain the same as in the initial state.
