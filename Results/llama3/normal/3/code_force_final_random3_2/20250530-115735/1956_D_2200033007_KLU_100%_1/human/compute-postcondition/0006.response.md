Output State: **`i` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `is_already_stairs` has been updated to False, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions. The list `arr` and the list of tuples `res` retain their original values, and the indices `i`, `j`, and `start_index` continue to satisfy the given constraints.
