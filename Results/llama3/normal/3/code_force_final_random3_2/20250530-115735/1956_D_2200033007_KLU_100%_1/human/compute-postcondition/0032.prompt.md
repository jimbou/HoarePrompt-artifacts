You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, and res is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers.
    is_already_stairs = True

If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` for any `j` in the range of `i + 1`, then `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement in the code snippet. The program simply ends without returning any value.

For any `j` in the range of `i + 1`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, and `is_already_stairs` is False.

The value of i is 0, j is 0, arr is a list of integers with arr[start_index] equal to 1, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, and res is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended to it. The value of is_already_stairs is False.

For any `j` in the range of `i + 1`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, and `is_already_stairs` is False.

        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is at least 0, `j` is `i` or `start_index + i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. For any `j` in the range of `i + 1`, the current value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1` and its return value has been discarded. Otherwise, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all `i`, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with argument `i - 1` and its return value has been returned.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement in the code snippet. The program simply ends without returning any value.

Case_2: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The values of variables i, j, arr, start_index, and res remain unchanged. The value of i is 0, j is 0, arr is a list of integers with arr[start_index] equal to 1, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, and res is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended to it. The value of is_already_stairs is False.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
