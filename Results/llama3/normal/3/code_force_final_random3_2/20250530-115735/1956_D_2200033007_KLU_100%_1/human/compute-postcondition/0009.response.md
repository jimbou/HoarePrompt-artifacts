Output State: **`i` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `j`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `res` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `is_already_stairs` is now explicitly set to False, regardless of the previous condition.
