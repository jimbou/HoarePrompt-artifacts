Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` by considering all possible cases: when the subarray is of length 1, when the maximum sum is achieved by making the entire subarray equal to its length, and when the maximum sum is achieved by dividing the subarray into two parts and making each part equal to its length. The function `func_2` constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum by recursively calling itself for the subarrays. The function `make_stairs` is a helper function that makes the subarray from `start_index` to `start_index + i` equal to `i` by performing the necessary operations.

The program correctly handles the base cases and the recursive cases, and it correctly updates the `res_dict` dictionary to store the results of the subproblems. The program also correctly constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
