Output State: **`i` is at least 0, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. For any `j` in the range of `i + 1`, the current value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, and `is_already_stairs` is False. The current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1` and its return value has been discarded.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decreased by 1, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`. The return value of the function has been discarded, meaning that it has not been assigned to any variable. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
