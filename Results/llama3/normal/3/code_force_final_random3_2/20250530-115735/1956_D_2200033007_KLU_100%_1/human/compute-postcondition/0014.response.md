Postcondition: ***`i` is at least 0, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. For any `j` in the range of `i + 1`, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, and `is_already_stairs` is False.***
