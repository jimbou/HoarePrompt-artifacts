Output State: **`i` is at least 1, `j` is `start_index + i`, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` remains at least 1, and `j` has reached the end of the loop range, which is `start_index + i`. The list `arr` has been modified such that all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` have been set to `i`. The other variables, `start_index`, `res`, and `is_already_stairs`, remain unchanged, with `start_index` still being a non-negative integer less than the length of `arr`, `res` still being a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` still being False. Additionally, the condition that `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` still holds true.
