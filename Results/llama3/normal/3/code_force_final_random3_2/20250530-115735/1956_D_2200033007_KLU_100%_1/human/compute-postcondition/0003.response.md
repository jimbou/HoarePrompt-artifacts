Output State: **`i` is at least 0, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. The current value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `i`, `j`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `res` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `is_already_stairs` has been updated to False. The condition that the current value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` still holds true.
