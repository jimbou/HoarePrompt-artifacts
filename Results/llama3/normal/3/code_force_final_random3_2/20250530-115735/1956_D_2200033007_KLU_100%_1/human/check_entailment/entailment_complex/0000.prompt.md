Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained from a subarray within a given array of non-negative integers. It takes three parameters: `start_index`, `end_index`, and `arr`, where `start_index` and `end_index` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(arr). The function returns the maximum value that can be obtained from the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`. If the subarray has only one element, the function returns the maximum value between 1 and the value of that element. If the subarray has more than one element, the function calculates the maximum value by considering all possible splits of the subarray and returns the maximum value that can be obtained. The function also stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.

Otherwise, it recursively searches for a subarray that meets the condition and returns the sum of the results of func_2 for the subarrays from start_index to i-1 and from i+1 to end_index if found. If no such subarray is found, no action is taken.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function transforms a given list of integers into a "staircase" structure by modifying the list in-place and appending tuples to a result list. It takes four parameters: a non-negative integer `i`, a list of integers `arr`, a non-negative integer `start_index`, and a list of tuples `res`. The function recursively calls itself with decreasing values of `i` until it reaches 0. If the list is already in a "staircase" structure, the function returns without modifying the list. If `i` is 0, it appends a tuple to the result list and sets the value at the current index in the list to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, it checks if the value at the current index plus `i` is equal to `i`. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with `i-1`. If it's not, the function sets all values from the current index to the current index plus `i` to `i`, appends a tuple to the result list, and then recursively calls itself with `i-1`. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the input list and result list in-place.
