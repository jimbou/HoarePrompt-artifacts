Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. Function 1 (`func_1`): This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained from a subarray within a given array of non-negative integers. It uses dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations. The function correctly handles the base case where the subarray has only one element and returns the maximum value between 1 and the value of that element. For subarrays with more than one element, it correctly calculates the maximum value by considering all possible splits of the subarray.

2. Function 2 (`func_2`): This function takes a list of non-negative integers and two indices, `start_index` and `end_index`, as input. It returns an empty list if the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` has a length of 1 and the value at `start_index` is 0. If the maximum value in the subarray is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, it returns a list containing a tuple (`start_index`, `end_index`). Otherwise, it recursively searches for a subarray that meets the condition and returns the sum of the results of `func_2` for the subarrays from `start_index` to `i-1` and from `i+1` to `end_index` if found. If no such subarray is found, no action is taken.

3. Function 3 (`make_stairs`): This function transforms a given list of integers into a "staircase" structure by modifying the list in-place and appending tuples to a result list. It correctly handles the base case where the list is already in a "staircase" structure and returns without modifying the list. For lists that are not in a "staircase" structure, it correctly sets all values from the current index to the current index plus `i` to `i`, appends a tuple to the result list, and then recursively calls itself with `i-1`.

The main program correctly calls `func_1` to calculate the maximum value that can be obtained from the input array and stores the result in the variable `res`. It then calls `func_2` to get the list of operations required to achieve the maximum value and stores the result in the variable `changes`. Finally, it prints the maximum value and the number of operations, followed by the list of operations.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
