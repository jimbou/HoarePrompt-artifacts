This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained from a subarray within a given array of non-negative integers. It takes three parameters: `start_index`, `end_index`, and `arr`, where `start_index` and `end_index` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(arr). The function returns the maximum value that can be obtained from the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]`. If the subarray has only one element, the function returns the maximum value between 1 and the value of that element. If the subarray has more than one element, the function calculates the maximum value by considering all possible splits of the subarray and returns the maximum value that can be obtained. The function also stores the results of subproblems in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
