The only variables in the loop head are variables  j, start_index and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `start_index` and `i`. If `j` is less than `start_index + i + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `start_index + 1`, `i` is at least 1, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` must be `start_index + 2`, `i` is at least 1, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`. 
State: **`i` is at least 1, `j` is `start_index + 2`, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is `i` and `arr[start_index + 1]` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`**
