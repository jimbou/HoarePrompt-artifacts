The only variables in the loop head are variable  j and i, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is True does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is at least 0 and j is now 0. 
State: **`i` is at least 0, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is True**
