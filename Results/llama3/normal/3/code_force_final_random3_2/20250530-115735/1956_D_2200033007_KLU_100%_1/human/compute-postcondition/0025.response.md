To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of `j`. If `j` is less than `start_index + i + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `start_index`, `i` is at least 1, and `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `start_index + 1`. The value of `i` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head. The value of `start_index` also remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is `start_index + 1`
* `i` is at least 1 (no change)
* `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)` (no change)

The other variables (`arr`, `res`, `is_already_stairs`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is at least 1, `j` is `start_index + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[start_index]` is `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < `len(arr)`, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`**
