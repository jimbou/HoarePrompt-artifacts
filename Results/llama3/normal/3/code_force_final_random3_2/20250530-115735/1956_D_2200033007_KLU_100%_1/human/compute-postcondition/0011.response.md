Output State: **`i` is at least 0, `j` is `i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` for any `j` in the range of `i + 1`, then `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` remains True.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `i`, and the value of `is_already_stairs` will be False if any element in the subarray of `arr` starting at `start_index` and of length `i + 1` is not equal to its index in that subarray. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` will remain True. The values of `arr`, `start_index`, and `res` are unchanged.
