Postcondition: ***`i` is at least 0, `j` is `i` or `start_index + i`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. For any `j` in the range of `i + 1`, the current value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1` and its return value has been discarded. Otherwise, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all `i`, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with argument `i - 1` and its return value has been returned.***
