Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation to maximize the sum of the elements of the array. The problem description states that the operation can be performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times, but the program does not keep track of the number of operations performed. 

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle the case when the maximum sum is achieved by setting all elements in a subarray to the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the subarray. The function `func_2` only checks if the maximum sum is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, but it does not consider the case when the maximum sum is achieved by setting all elements to a smaller value.

For example, if the input array is [0, 1, 2, 3], the program will not correctly maximize the sum of the elements. The correct solution would be to set all elements to 0, which would result in a sum of 0, but the program will not achieve this solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
