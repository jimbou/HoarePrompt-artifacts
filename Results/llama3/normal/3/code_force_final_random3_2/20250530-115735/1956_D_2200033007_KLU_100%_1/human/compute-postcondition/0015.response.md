Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. For any `j` in the range of 1, `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, and `is_already_stairs` is False.***
