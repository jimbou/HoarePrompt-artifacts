Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `is_already_stairs` which is set to True. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
