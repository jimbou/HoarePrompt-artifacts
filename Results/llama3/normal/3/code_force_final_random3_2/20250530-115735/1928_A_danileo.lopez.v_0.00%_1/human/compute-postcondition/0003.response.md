Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `t` must be greater than 0. The current values of `a` and `b` are such that at least one of them is even, i.e., either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even.**
