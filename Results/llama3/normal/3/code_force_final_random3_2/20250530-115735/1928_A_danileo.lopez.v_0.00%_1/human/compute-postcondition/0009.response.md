Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `t` must be greater than 0. If either `a` or `b` (or both) is even, 'Yes' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'No' is printed.***
