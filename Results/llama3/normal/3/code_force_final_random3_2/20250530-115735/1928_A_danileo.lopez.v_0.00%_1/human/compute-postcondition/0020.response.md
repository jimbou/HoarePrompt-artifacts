Output: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) and are the first pair of integers from the stdin, `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) minus the first pair of integers, `t` must be greater than 0. If either `a` or `b` is even, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed, and 'Yes' is printed**
