Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers representing the size of a rectangle. It then prints 'Yes' if either dimension of the rectangle is even, and 'No' otherwise, repeating this process for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves stdin empty and prints a 'Yes' or 'No' result for each input rectangle.**
