Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `t` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two integers from the first line of input. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `_` remains 0. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
