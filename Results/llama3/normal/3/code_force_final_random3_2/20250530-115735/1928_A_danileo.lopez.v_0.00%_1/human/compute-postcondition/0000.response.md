The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts the first line of input from stdin, which contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), the number of test cases. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains multiple lines of input, with the first line (containing the value of `t`) removed. The remaining lines contain two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**
