To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, so we can only adjust the states of `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `t` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be decremented by 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive).

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `t` must be greater than 0**
