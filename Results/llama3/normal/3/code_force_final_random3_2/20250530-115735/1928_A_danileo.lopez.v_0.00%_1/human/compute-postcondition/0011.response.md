Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `t` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decreased by 1 because one line of input has been read from stdin. The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers read from the first line of input. The value of `_` remains unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but one less than before. The range of `t` has been updated to reflect that it has been decreased by 1.
