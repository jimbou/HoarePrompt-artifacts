The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), `a` and `b` are integers (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `t` must be greater than 0. If either `a` or `b` is even, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.**
