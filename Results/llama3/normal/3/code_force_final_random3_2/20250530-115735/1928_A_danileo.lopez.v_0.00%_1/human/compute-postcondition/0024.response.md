Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is equal to the initial value of `t`, stdin is empty, and 'Yes' or 'No' has been printed for each pair of integers that were initially in stdin.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, the standard input (stdin) will be empty because all pairs of integers have been read, and 'Yes' or 'No' will have been printed for each pair of integers that were initially in stdin, depending on whether either number in the pair was even or both were odd.
