Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least one more element, `n` is the first element of the next test case, `x` is the second element of the next test case, `y` is the third element of the next test case, `arr` is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 1 element, `results` is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of the values of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, `count` is the sum of the original count and the sum of the values of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times (num % x, num % y) appears in arr, `num` is the last element in arr, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is num % y, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y)**

The code appends the current count to the results list. The count is the sum of the original count and the sum of the values of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
