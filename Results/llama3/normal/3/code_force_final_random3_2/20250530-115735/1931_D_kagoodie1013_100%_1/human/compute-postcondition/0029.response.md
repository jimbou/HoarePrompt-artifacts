Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases with at least one more element, n is the first element of the next test case, x is the second element of the next test case, y is the third element of the next test case, arr is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 1 element, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of the values of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, count is the sum of the original count and the sum of the values of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to the number of times (num % x, num % y) appears in arr, num is the last element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all elements in the array `arr`. The `residue_map` dictionary now contains the count of each residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` that appears in `arr`. The `count` variable has been updated to include the sum of the values of `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map`, which represents the total count of residue pairs. The `results` list has been updated to include the original count plus the sum of the values of `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map`. The other variables remain unchanged.
