Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the problem description. It uses a dictionary to store the residues of the numbers in the array modulo x and y, and then for each number, it checks if there is a pair that satisfies the conditions.

The program correctly handles the case when x or y is 1, and it also correctly handles the case when the array contains duplicate numbers. The program also correctly handles the case when the array is empty.

The program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array, and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array. This is because the program uses a dictionary to store the residues of the numbers in the array, and the size of the dictionary can be up to n in the worst case.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the problem description.
