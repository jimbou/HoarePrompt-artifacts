Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases with at least one more element, n is the first element of the next test case, x is the second element of the next test case, y is the third element of the next test case, arr is the fourth element of the next test case, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, num is the last element in the original list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

The code resets the count to 0 and initializes an empty dictionary for residue_map. The values of test_cases, n, x, y, arr, results, num, r_x, r_y, and current_key remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
