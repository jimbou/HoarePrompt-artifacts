The only variable in the loop head is variable  num, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `num` is the third element in the list.
State: **test_cases is a list of test cases, results is an empty list, count is the original count plus the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) and its value incremented by 1, arr is a list that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**
