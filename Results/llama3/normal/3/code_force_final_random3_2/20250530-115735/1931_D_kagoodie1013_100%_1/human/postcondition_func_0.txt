This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains an integer n and a list of n integers, along with two integers x and y. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the residue of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the occurrences of these residues. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs of integers in the corresponding test case that have the same residue modulo x and y. The function does not modify the input list of test cases.
