Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases, results is an empty list, count is the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, residue_map is a dictionary with the keys (num % x, num % y) and their values incremented by 1, arr is an empty list, num is the last element in the original list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the test_cases list remains unchanged, the results list is still empty, the count variable has been incremented by the sum of the values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, the residue_map dictionary has been updated with the keys (num % x, num % y) and their values incremented by 1, the arr list is now empty because all elements have been processed, num is the last element in the original list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, and current_key is (num % x, num % y).
