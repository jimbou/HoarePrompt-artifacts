Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases with at least one more element, n is the first element of the next test case, x is the second element of the next test case, y is the third element of the next test case, arr is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the value of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, count is the sum of the original count and the value of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to 1 plus the original value of (num % x, num % y), num is the third element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

The code block modifies the values of `count`, `residue_map`, and `current_key`. The first line assigns the value of `-num % x` to `r_x`, and the second line assigns the value of `num % y` to `r_y`. The third line increments `count` by the value of `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map`, which is 0 if the key does not exist. The fourth line assigns the value of `(num % x, num % y)` to `current_key`. The fifth line increments the value of `current_key` in `residue_map` by 1. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, and `num` remain unchanged.
