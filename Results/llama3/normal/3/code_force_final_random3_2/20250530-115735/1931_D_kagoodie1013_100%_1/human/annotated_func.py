#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of three elements: an integer n, and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers.

    #State: test_cases is an empty list, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, arr is an empty list, num is undefined, r_x is undefined, r_y is undefined, current_key is undefined
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' that contains the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, where count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, and r_x and r_y are undefined.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains an integer n and a list of n integers, along with two integers x and y. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the residue of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the occurrences of these residues. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs of integers in the corresponding test case that have the same residue modulo x and y. The function does not modify the input list of test cases.
