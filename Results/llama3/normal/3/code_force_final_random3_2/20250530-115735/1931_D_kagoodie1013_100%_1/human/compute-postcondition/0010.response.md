Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, count is the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, residue_map is a dictionary with the keys (num % x, num % y) and their values incremented by 1, arr is an empty list, num is the last element in the original list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

The code appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The value of `count` is the original count plus the sum of values of `residue_map` for the keys `(r_x, r_y)` if they exist. The other variables remain unchanged.
