Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of three elements: a positive integer n, and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, results is an empty list, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    r_x = -num % x
    r_y = num % y
    count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
    current_key = num % x, num % y
    residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of test cases, results is an empty list, count is the original count plus the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) and its value incremented by 1, arr is a list that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: test_cases is a list of test cases, results is an empty list, count is the original count plus the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) and its value incremented by 1, arr is a list that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: test_cases is a list of test cases, results is an empty list, count is the original count plus the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) and its value incremented by 1, arr is a list that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
