To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. `n` must be a positive integer, as it represents the number of integers in the list `arr`.
2. `x` and `y` are integers, but their values are not crucial for the loop to execute. However, they should be present in the test case.
3. `arr` must be a list of `n` integers, as it is unpacked from the test case.


Considering these adjustments, the updated state is:


State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of three elements: a positive integer `n`, and two integers `x` and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers, `results` is an empty list**
