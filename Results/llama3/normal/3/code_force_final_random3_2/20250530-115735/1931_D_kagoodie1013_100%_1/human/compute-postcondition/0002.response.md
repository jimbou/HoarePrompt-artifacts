Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of three elements: a positive integer n, and two integers x and y, followed by a list of n integers, results is an empty list, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary**

The code initializes two new variables, `count` and `residue_map`, and assigns them the values 0 and an empty dictionary, respectively. The initial state of `test_cases` and `results` remains unchanged.
