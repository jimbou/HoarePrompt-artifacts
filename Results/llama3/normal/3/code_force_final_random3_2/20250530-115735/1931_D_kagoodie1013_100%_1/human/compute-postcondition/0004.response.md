Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases, results is an empty list, count is the original count plus the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) and its value incremented by 1, arr is a list that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y).**

In this output state, the value of count has been incremented by the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists. The residue_map has been updated with the key (num % x, num % y) and its value incremented by 1. The values of r_x and r_y have been calculated as -num % x and num % y respectively. The current_key has been set to (num % x, num % y). All other variables remain unchanged.
