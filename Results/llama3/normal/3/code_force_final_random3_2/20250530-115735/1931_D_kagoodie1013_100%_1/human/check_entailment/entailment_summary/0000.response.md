Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary, residue_map, to store the residues of the numbers in the array modulo x and y. For each number in the array, it calculates the residue modulo x and y, and then checks if the complementary residue (i.e., the residue that would make a beautiful pair) is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs. It then updates the dictionary with the current number's residue.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It iterates over the array only once, making it efficient for large inputs. The use of a dictionary to store the residues allows for efficient lookups and updates.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. The line `r_x = -num % x` should be `r_x = (x - num % x) % x` to correctly calculate the residue modulo x. The current implementation would result in incorrect residues for negative numbers.

Correctness: **False**
