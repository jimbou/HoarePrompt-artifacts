Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices is considered beautiful if the sum of the elements at those indices is divisible by x and the difference is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary, residue_map, to store the residues of the elements in the array modulo x and y. For each element, it calculates the residue modulo x and y, and then checks if the complementary residue (i.e., the residue that would make the sum divisible by x and the difference divisible by y) is already present in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

The program then returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of beautiful pairs in the corresponding test case.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic for finding beautiful pairs. It iterates over the array, calculates the residues, and checks for complementary residues in the dictionary. The use of a dictionary allows for efficient lookup and counting of residues.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the line `r_x = -num % x`, the `-` sign is unnecessary and can be removed. The correct line should be `r_x = num % x`. This is because the residue of a number modulo x is the remainder when the number is divided by x, and the `-` sign would give the wrong result.

Correctness: **True**
