Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least one more element, `n` is the first element of the next test case, `x` is the second element of the next test case, `y` is the third element of the next test case, `arr` is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 1 element, `results` is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of `residue_map` for the keys `(r_x, r_y)` if they exist, `count` is the original count plus the sum of values of `residue_map` for the keys `(r_x, r_y)` if they exist, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(num % x, num % y)` having a value one greater than its original value for all elements in `arr`, `num` is the last element in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**

The code appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The value of `count` is the original count plus the sum of values of `residue_map` for the keys `(r_x, r_y)` if they exist. The other variables remain unchanged.
