Output State: **test_cases is an empty list, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, count is 0, residue_map is an empty dictionary, arr is an empty list, num is undefined, r_x is undefined, r_y is undefined, current_key is undefined**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list of test cases is empty, the results list contains the final count of residue pairs for each test case, the count of residue pairs is reset to 0, the residue map is empty, the array of numbers is empty, and the variables num, r_x, r_y, and current_key are undefined because they are no longer needed.
