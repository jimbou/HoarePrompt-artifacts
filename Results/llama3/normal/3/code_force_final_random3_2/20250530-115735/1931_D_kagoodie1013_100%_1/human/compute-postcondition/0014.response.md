Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases with at least one more element, n is the first element of the next test case, x is the second element of the next test case, y is the third element of the next test case, arr is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 1 element, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, count is the original count plus the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) having a value one greater than its original value, num is the first element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

The code updates the values of `count`, `residue_map`, and `current_key`. The first line calculates the new value of `r_x` as `-num % x`, and the second line calculates the new value of `r_y` as `num % y`. The third line increments `count` by the value of `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists, or by 0 if it does not. The fourth line updates the value of `residue_map` for the key `(num % x, num % y)` by incrementing it by 1. The fifth line updates the value of `current_key` to `(num % x, num % y)`.
