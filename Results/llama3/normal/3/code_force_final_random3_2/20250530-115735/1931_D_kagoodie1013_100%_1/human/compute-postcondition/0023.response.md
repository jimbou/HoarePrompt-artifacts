According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` must have at least 1 element and `num` is the first element in `arr`. 
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least one more element, `n` is the first element of the next test case, `x` is the second element of the next test case, `y` is the third element of the next test case, `arr` is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 1 element, `results` is a list with the last element being the original count, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `arr`, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is num % y, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y)**
