Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases with at least one more element, n is the first element of the next test case, x is the second element of the next test case, y is the third element of the next test case, arr is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 3 elements, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, count is the original count plus the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) having a value one greater than its original value, num is the third element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

The code block modifies the values of `count`, `residue_map`, and `current_key`. The first two lines calculate the values of `r_x` and `r_y` based on `num`, `x`, and `y`. The third line increments `count` by the value of `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists. The fourth line updates `current_key` to `(num % x, num % y)`. The fifth line increments the value of `residue_map` for the key `current_key` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
