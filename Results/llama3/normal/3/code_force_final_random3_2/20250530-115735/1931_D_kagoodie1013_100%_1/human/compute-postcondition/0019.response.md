Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases with at least one more element, n is the first element of the next test case, x is the second element of the next test case, y is the third element of the next test case, arr is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 1 element, results is a list with the last element being the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, count is the original count plus the sum of values of residue_map for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) having a value one greater than its original value for all elements in arr, num is the last element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The list of test cases remains unchanged, with at least one more test case available.
- The values of n, x, and y remain the same, corresponding to the next test case.
- The array 'arr' has been fully processed, with its elements used to update the 'residue_map' and 'count'.
- The 'results' list has been updated with the final count, which includes the original count plus the sum of values in 'residue_map' for the keys (r_x, r_y) if they exist.
- The 'residue_map' dictionary has been updated with the count of occurrences of each residue pair (num % x, num % y) for all elements in 'arr'.
- The variables 'num', 'r_x', 'r_y', and 'current_key' hold the values corresponding to the last element processed in 'arr'.
