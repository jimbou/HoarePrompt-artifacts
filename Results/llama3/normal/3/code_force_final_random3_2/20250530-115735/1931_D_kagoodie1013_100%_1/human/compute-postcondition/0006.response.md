Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases, results is an empty list, count is the original count plus the value of residue_map for the key (r_x, r_y) if it exists, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) and its value incremented by 1, arr is a list that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

The code block modifies the values of `r_x`, `r_y`, `count`, `current_key`, and `residue_map`. The first two lines calculate the values of `r_x` and `r_y` based on the value of `num`. The third line increments the value of `count` by the value of `residue_map` for the key `(r_x, r_y)` if it exists. The fourth line updates the value of `current_key` to `(num % x, num % y)`. The fifth line increments the value of `residue_map` for the key `current_key` by 1. The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `arr`, and `num` remain unchanged.
