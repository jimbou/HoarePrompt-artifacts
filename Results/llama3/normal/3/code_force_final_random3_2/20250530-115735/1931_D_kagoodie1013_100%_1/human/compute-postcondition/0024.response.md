Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases with at least one more element, n is the first element of the next test case, x is the second element of the next test case, y is the third element of the next test case, arr is the fourth element of the next test case and must have at least 1 element, results is a list with the last element being the original count, count is the sum of the original count and the value of (r_x, r_y) in residue_map, residue_map is a dictionary with the key (num % x, num % y) mapped to 1, num is the first element in arr, r_x is -num % x, r_y is num % y, current_key is (num % x, num % y)**

The code updates the values of `r_x`, `r_y`, `count`, `residue_map`, and `current_key`. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged. The value of `count` is incremented by the value of `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map`, which is initially 0. The `residue_map` dictionary is updated with the key `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to 1. The values of `r_x` and `r_y` are recalculated based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The value of `current_key` is updated to `(num % x, num % y)`.
