Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, `s` is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[s]` + `a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[b]` + `a[p[b] - 1]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[p[b] - 1]` * `k` + `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[p[s] - 1]` * `k` + `sp`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`. If `k` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues executing.**
