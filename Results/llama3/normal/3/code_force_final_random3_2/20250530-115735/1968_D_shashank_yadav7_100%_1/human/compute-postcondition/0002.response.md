Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, b is a positive integer minus 1, s is a positive integer minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b, bm is the value of a at index b multiplied by k, sm is the value of a at index s multiplied by k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.**

The code executes a series of assignments and calculations based on the input values. The first line reads four space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to n, k, b, and s. The second line reads n space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to the list p. The third line reads n space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to the list a. The fourth and fifth lines decrement b and s by 1, respectively. The sixth line assigns the value of a at index s to sp. The seventh line assigns the value of a at index b to bp. The eighth line assigns the value of a at index b multiplied by k to bm. The ninth line assigns the value of a at index s multiplied by k to sm. The value of t and i remains unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 1.
