Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on the maximum score they can achieve by moving through a permutation of indices and accumulating values from an array. The function takes no parameters and returns no values, but instead prints the winner of the game for each test case. The game is played for multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines of input: the number of indices, the number of moves, and the starting indices for Bodya and Sasha, followed by the permutation of indices and the array of values. The function calculates the maximum score for each player by simulating their moves and accumulating values, and then prints the winner of the game based on their maximum scores.**
