Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is a positive integer minus 1, `s` is a positive integer minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is the value of `a` at index `b`. If `k` is 0, then `bm` is 0, `sm` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is a positive integer minus 1, and `bm` is the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by (`k` minus 1), `sm` is the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by (`k` minus 1).***
