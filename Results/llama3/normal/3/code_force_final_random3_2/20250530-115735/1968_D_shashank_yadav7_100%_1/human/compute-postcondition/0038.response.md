Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is either -1 or 0, `b` is the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, `s` is the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by -1, `sm` is the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by -1, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, and `i` is 0. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with `k` being -1.**
