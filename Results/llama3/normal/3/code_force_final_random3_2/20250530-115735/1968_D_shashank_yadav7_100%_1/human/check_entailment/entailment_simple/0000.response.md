Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game for both Bodya and Sasha, keeping track of their maximum possible scores at each turn. The program uses a greedy approach, always choosing the move that maximizes the score for each player. This is optimal because the game is deterministic, and the players can always make the move that maximizes their score.

The program also correctly handles the case where the game lasts for more than n turns, where n is the length of the permutation. In this case, the program simulates the game for n turns, and then uses the maximum possible score for each player to determine the winner.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the permutation. This is because the program simulates the game for at most n turns, and each turn takes constant time.

The program's space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the permutation. This is because the program stores the permutation and the array a in memory.

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
