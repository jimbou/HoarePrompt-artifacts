Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is either -3 or -2, `b` is the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, `s` is the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the value of `a` at index `s` plus the value of `a` at index `s` plus the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is the value of `a` at index `b` plus the value of `a` at index `b` plus the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is the maximum value between the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by `k` plus the value of `a` at index `b` plus the value of `a` at index `b` and the original value of `bm`, `sm` is the maximum value between the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by `k` plus the value of `a` at index `s` plus the value of `a` at index `s` and the original value of `sm`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, and `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is affected by the break statement.
