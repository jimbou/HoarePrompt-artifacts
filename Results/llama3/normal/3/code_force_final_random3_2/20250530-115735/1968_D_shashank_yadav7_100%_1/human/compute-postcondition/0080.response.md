Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, b is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to its original value plus a[s] + a[p[s] - 1] + a[s], bp is an integer equal to its original value plus a[b] + a[p[b] - 1] + a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp and a[b] * k + bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp and a[s] * k + sp, t is a positive integer greater than n.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `p`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. The values of `b` and `s` are updated to be one less than the value at the index of `p` corresponding to their original values. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively, in addition to their original increments. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the new calculated values based on `a[b]`, `a[s]`, `k`, `bp`, and `sp`.
