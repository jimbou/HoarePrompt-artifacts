The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is n, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than n plus 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than n, `i` is n plus 1, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, `s` is the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the sum of the values of `a` at index `s` from the initial state to the final state, `bp` is the sum of the values of `a` at index `b` from the initial state to the final state, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by `k` plus the original value of `a` at index `b`, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by `k` plus the original value of `a` at index `s`, `k` is 0 or 1. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, 'Bodya' is printed. If `bm` is less than `sm`, 'Sasha' is printed. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, 'Draw' is printed.**
