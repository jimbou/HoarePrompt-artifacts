Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, b is a positive integer minus 1, s is a positive integer minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b, bm is the value of a at index b multiplied by k, sm is the value of a at index s multiplied by k, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is greater than 0, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the original value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b plus the original value of a at index b, bm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index b multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index b, sm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index s multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index s.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, n is greater than 2, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the original value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b plus the original value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b, bm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index b multiplied by (k-1) plus the original value of a at index b, sm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index s multiplied by (k-1) plus the original value of a at index s, k is one less than its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 3, n is greater than 3, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the original value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b plus the original value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b, bm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index b multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index b, sm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index s multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index s, and if k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
