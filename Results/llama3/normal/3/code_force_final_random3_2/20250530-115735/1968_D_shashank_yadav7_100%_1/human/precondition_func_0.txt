stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a. The integer n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, P_B and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n.
