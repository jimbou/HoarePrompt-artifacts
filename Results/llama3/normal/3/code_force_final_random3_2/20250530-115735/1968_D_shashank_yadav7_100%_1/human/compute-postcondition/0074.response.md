Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer equal to p[b] - 1, `s` is an integer equal to p[s] - 1, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `sp` is an integer equal to its original value plus a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to its original value plus a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * (k-1) + bp, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * (k-1) + sp, `t` is a positive integer greater than n, `k` is a positive integer. If k is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
