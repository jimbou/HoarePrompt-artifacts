Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game for each test case and determines the winner based on the maximum score that can be achieved by each player.

The program first reads the input for each test case, which consists of the number of indices `n`, the number of moves `k`, and the starting indices for Bodya `b` and Sasha `s`. It then reads the permutation of indices `p` and the array of values `a`.

The program then simulates the game for each player by iterating `n` times. In each iteration, it updates the current index for each player by moving to the next index in the permutation, and it updates the maximum score for each player by considering the maximum score that can be achieved by staying at the current index or moving to the next index.

Finally, the program prints the winner of the game based on the maximum scores achieved by each player.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of moves `k` is greater than the number of indices `n`, by simulating the game for `n` moves and then using the maximum score achieved by each player to determine the winner.

The program also correctly handles the case where the starting indices for Bodya and Sasha are the same, by simulating the game for each player separately and then comparing their maximum scores to determine the winner.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
