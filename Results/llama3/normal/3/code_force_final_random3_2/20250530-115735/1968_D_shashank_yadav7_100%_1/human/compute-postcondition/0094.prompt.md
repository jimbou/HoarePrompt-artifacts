Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a. The integer n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, P_B and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n, n is a positive integer, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the sum of the values of a at index s from the initial state to the final state, bp is the sum of the values of a at index b from the initial state to the final state, bm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index b multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index b, sm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index s multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index s, k is 0 or 1. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. If bm is equal to sm, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, k is a negative integer, b is the value of p at index b minus 1 minus 1 ... minus 1 (n times), s is the value of p at index s minus 1 minus 1 ... minus 1 (n times), p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s ... plus the value of a at index s (n times), bp is the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b ... plus the value of a at index b (n times), bm is the maximum value between the value of a at index b multiplied by k plus the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b ... plus the value of a at index b and the original value of bm, sm is the maximum value between the value of a at index s multiplied by k plus the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s ... plus the value of a at index s and the original value of sm, t is a positive integer greater than n, and i is n-1. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Draw' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, i is equal to n, b is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of a[s] and a[p[s] - 1] for i iterations, bp is an integer equal to its original value plus the sum of a[b] and a[p[b] - 1] for i iterations, bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp and a[b] * k + bp for i iterations, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp and a[s] * k + sp for i iterations, t is a positive integer greater than n, k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n. If bm is greater than sm, 'Bodya' is printed. If bm is less than sm, 'Sasha' is printed. If bm is equal to sm, 'Draw' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
