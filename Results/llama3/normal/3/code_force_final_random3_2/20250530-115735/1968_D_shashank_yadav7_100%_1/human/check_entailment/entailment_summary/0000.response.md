Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game for each test case, calculating the maximum score for each player by accumulating values from the array as they move through the permutation of indices. The program then prints the winner of the game based on their maximum scores.

The program handles the case where the number of moves is less than the length of the permutation by breaking out of the loop early, which is correct. It also handles the case where the maximum scores of the two players are equal by printing "Draw", which is correct.

The program uses a greedy approach to calculate the maximum score for each player, which is correct because the game is designed such that the players always try to maximize their score. The program also uses a simple and efficient algorithm to simulate the game, which is correct.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
