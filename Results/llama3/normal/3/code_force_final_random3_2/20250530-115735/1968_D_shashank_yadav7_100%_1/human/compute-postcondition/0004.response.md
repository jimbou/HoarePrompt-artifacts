Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer minus 1, `b` is a positive integer minus 1, `s` is a positive integer minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by (`k` minus 1), `sm` is the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by (`k` minus 1), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `k`, which is now a positive integer minus 1. The values of `bm` and `sm` are also updated to reflect the new value of `k`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1.
