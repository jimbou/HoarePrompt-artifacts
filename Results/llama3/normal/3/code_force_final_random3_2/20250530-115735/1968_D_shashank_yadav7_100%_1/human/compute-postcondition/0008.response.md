Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 1, n is greater than 0, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the original value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b plus the original value of a at index b, bm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index b multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index b, sm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index s multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index s.**

The code modifies the values of `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`. The new values of `b` and `s` are calculated by subtracting 1 from the values of `p` at indices `b` and `s`, respectively. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a` at indices `s` and `b`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the values of `a` at indices `b` and `s` multiplied by `k` plus the original values of `a` at indices `b` and `s`, respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
