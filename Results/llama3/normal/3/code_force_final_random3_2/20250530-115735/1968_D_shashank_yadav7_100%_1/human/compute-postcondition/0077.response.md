Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, `s` is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[s]` + `a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[b]` + `a[p[b] - 1]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[p[b] - 1]` * `k` + `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[p[s] - 1]` * `k` + `sp`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1. If `k` is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now one less than its original value. If `k` is now equal to 0, we exit the innermost loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain the same as before.
