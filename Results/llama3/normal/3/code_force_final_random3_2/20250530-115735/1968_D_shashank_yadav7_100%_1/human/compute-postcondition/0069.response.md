Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer, `s` is an integer, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer, `bp` is an integer, `bm` is an integer, `sm` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
