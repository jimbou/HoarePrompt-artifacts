Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, `s` is the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the value of `a` at index `s` plus the original value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is the value of `a` at index `b` plus the original value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by (`k-1`) plus the original value of `a` at index `b`, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by (`k-1`) plus the original value of `a` at index `s`, `k` is one less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the value of `a` at index `b` or `s` multiplied by the new value of `k` (which is one less than its original value) plus the original value of `a` at index `b` or `s`.
