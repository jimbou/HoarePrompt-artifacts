Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is 0 or 1, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b, bm is the value of a at index b multiplied by k, sm is the value of a at index s multiplied by k, t is a positive integer greater than n, i is n plus 1, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, k is either -1 or 0, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b, bm is the maximum value between the value of a at index b multiplied by -1 plus the value of a at index b and the original value of bm, sm is the maximum value between the value of a at index s multiplied by -1 plus the value of a at index s and the original value of sm, t is a positive integer greater than n, and i is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, k is either -2 or -1, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b, bm is the maximum value between the value of a at index b multiplied by k plus the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b and the original value of bm, sm is the maximum value between the value of a at index s multiplied by k plus the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s and the original value of sm, t is a positive integer greater than n, and i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, k is either -3 or -2, b is the value of p at index b minus 1 minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1 minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b, bm is the maximum value between the value of a at index b multiplied by k plus the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b and the original value of bm, sm is the maximum value between the value of a at index s multiplied by k plus the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s and the original value of sm, t is a positive integer greater than n, and i is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
