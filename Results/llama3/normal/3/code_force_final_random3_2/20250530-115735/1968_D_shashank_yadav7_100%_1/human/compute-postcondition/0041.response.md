Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is either -2 or -1, `b` is the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, `s` is the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the value of `a` at index `s` plus the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is the value of `a` at index `b` plus the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is the maximum value between the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by -1 plus the value of `a` at index `b` and the original value of `bm`, `sm` is the maximum value between the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by -1 plus the value of `a` at index `s` and the original value of `sm`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, and `i` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been decremented by 1, so it is now either -2 or -1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still a positive integer, `b` and `s` still being the values of `p` at their respective indices minus 1, `p` and `a` still being lists of `n` integers, `sp` and `bp` still being the sums of the values of `a` at their respective indices, `bm` and `sm` still being the maximum values between the negated and original values of `a` at their respective indices, `t` still a positive integer greater than `n`, and `i` still 1.
