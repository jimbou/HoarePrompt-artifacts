In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
- The values of `b` and `s` are updated based on the values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`, respectively, and are equal to `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` and `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, respectively.
- The values of `p` and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `sp` is equal to its original value plus the sum of `a[s]` and `a[p[s] - 1]` for `i` iterations.
- The value of `bp` is equal to its original value plus the sum of `a[b]` and `a[p[b] - 1]` for `i` iterations.
- The value of `bm` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp` and `a[b] * k + bp` for `i` iterations.
- The value of `sm` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp` and `a[s] * k + sp` for `i` iterations.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and is a positive integer greater than `n`.
- The value of `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`.
