Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, b is an integer equal to p[b] - 1, s is an integer equal to p[s] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to its original value plus a[s], bp is an integer equal to its original value plus a[b], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * k + bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * k + sp, t is a positive integer greater than n. If k is 0, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the values of `b` and `s` have been updated based on the values in the list `p`. The values of `sp` and `bp` have been incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` have been updated to be the maximum of their original values and the new calculated values based on `a[b]`, `a[s]`, `k`, `bp`, and `sp`. The value of `k` determines whether these changes are made or not. All other variables remain unchanged.
