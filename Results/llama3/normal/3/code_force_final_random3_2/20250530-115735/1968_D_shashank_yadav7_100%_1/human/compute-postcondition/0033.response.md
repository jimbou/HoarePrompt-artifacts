Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is 0 or 1, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b, bm is the value of a at index b multiplied by k, sm is the value of a at index s multiplied by k, t is a positive integer greater than n, i is n plus 1, stdin is empty.**

The code block reads in four integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. It then reads in two lists of integers from stdin and assigns them to `p` and `a`. The values of `b` and `s` are decremented by 1. The values of `a` at indices `s` and `b` are assigned to `sp` and `bp`, respectively. The values of `a` at indices `b` and `s` multiplied by `k` are assigned to `bm` and `sm`, respectively. The initial state's values of `t` and `i` are not modified by the code. Stdin is empty after the code execution.
