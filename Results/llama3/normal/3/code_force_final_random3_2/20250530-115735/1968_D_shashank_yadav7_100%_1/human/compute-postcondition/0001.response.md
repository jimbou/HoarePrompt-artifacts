The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a. The integer n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, P_B and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n.**
