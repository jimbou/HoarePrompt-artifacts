Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, `s` is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[s]` + `a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[b]` + `a[p[b] - 1]`, `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[p[b] - 1]` * `k` + `bp`, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and `a[p[s] - 1]` * `k` + `sp`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the only effect of the code is to exit the current loop or if statement.
