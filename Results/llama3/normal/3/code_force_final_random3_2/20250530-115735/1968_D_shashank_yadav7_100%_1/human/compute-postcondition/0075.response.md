Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, b is an integer equal to p[p[b] - 1] - 1, s is an integer equal to p[p[s] - 1] - 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is an integer equal to its original value plus a[s] + a[p[s] - 1], bp is an integer equal to its original value plus a[b] + a[p[b] - 1], bm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp, sm is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp, t is a positive integer greater than n, k is a positive integer. If k is equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**

In this final state, the values of `b` and `s` have been updated to be equal to `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` and `p[p[s] - 1] - 1` respectively, based on the new values of `p[b]` and `p[s]`. The values of `sp` and `bp` have been incremented by `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, and then further incremented by `a[p[s] - 1]` and `a[p[b] - 1]` respectively. The values of `bm` and `sm` have been updated to be the maximum of their original values and `a[p[b] - 1] * k + bp` and `a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp` respectively. The values of `n`, `i`, `p`, `a`, `t`, and `k` remain unchanged.
