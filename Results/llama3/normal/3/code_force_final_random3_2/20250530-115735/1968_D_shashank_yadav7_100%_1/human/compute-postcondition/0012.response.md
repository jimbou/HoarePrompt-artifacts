Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, `s` is the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the value of `a` at index `s` plus the original value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is the value of `a` at index `b` plus the original value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by (`k-1`) plus the original value of `a` at index `b`, `sm` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by (`k-1`) plus the original value of `a` at index `s`, `k` is one less than its original value. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
