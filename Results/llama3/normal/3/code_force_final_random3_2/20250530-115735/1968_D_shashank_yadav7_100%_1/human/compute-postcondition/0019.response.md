Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n, n is a positive integer, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the sum of the values of a at index s from the initial state to the final state, bp is the sum of the values of a at index b from the initial state to the final state, bm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index b multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index b, sm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index s multiplied by k plus the original value of a at index s, k is 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 0.
* The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
* The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
* The value of `b` is the result of repeatedly applying the transformation `b = p[b] - 1` until the loop terminates.
* The value of `s` is the result of repeatedly applying the transformation `s = p[s] - 1` until the loop terminates.
* The lists `p` and `a` remain unchanged.
* The value of `sp` is the sum of the values of `a` at index `s` from the initial state to the final state.
* The value of `bp` is the sum of the values of `a` at index `b` from the initial state to the final state.
* The value of `bm` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by `k` plus the original value of `a` at index `b`.
* The value of `sm` is the maximum of its original value and the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by `k` plus the original value of `a` at index `s`.
* The value of `k` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the loop terminated due to `k` reaching 0 or the loop executing `n` times.
