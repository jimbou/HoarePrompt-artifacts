The input contains an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, k, P_B, P_S, followed by two lists of n integers, p and a. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, P_B and P_S are positive integers less than or equal to n, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a is a list of positive integers.
