Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the game lasts for more than n turns, where n is the length of the permutation. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the scores of the players because it only iterates n times to calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by staying at the same position or moving to the next position in the permutation.

For example, if the input is:

10
8 10 4 1
5 1 4 3 2 8 6 7
1 1 2 1 2 100 101 102

The program will not correctly calculate the scores of the players because it only iterates 8 times, but the game lasts for 10 turns.

To correctly handle this case, the program should iterate k times, where k is the duration of the game, to calculate the scores of the players.
