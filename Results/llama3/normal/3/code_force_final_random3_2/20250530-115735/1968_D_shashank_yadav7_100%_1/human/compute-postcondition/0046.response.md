Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is either -3 or -2, `b` is the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, `s` is the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `sp` is the value of `a` at index `s` plus the value of `a` at index `s` plus the value of `a` at index `s`, `bp` is the value of `a` at index `b` plus the value of `a` at index `b` plus the value of `a` at index `b`, `bm` is the maximum value between the value of `a` at index `b` multiplied by `k` plus the value of `a` at index `b` plus the value of `a` at index `b` and the original value of `bm`, `sm` is the maximum value between the value of `a` at index `s` multiplied by `k` plus the value of `a` at index `s` plus the value of `a` at index `s` and the original value of `sm`, `t` is a positive integer greater than `n`, and `i` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `k` being either -3 or -2. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and relationships.
