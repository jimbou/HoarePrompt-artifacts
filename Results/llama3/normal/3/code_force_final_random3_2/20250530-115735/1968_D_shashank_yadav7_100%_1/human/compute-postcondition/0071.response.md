The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer equal to p[b] - 1, `s` is an integer equal to p[s] - 1, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `sp` is an integer equal to its original value plus a[s], `bp` is an integer equal to its original value plus a[b], `bm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[b] * k + bp, `sm` is an integer equal to the maximum of its original value and a[s] * k + sp, `t` is a positive integer greater than n. If k is 0, no changes are made.**
