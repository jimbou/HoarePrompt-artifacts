Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 2, n is greater than 2, b is the value of p at index b minus 1, s is the value of p at index s minus 1, p is a list of n integers, a is a list of n integers, sp is the value of a at index s plus the original value of a at index s plus the value of a at index s, bp is the value of a at index b plus the original value of a at index b plus the value of a at index b, bm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index b multiplied by (k-1) plus the original value of a at index b, sm is the maximum of its original value and the value of a at index s multiplied by (k-1) plus the original value of a at index s, k is one less than its original value.**

The code modifies the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`. The value of `b` is updated to be the value of `p` at index `b` minus 1, and the value of `s` is updated to be the value of `p` at index `s` minus 1. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated to be the maximum of their original values and the value of `a` at index `b` or `s` multiplied by (`k-1`) plus the original value of `a` at index `b` or `s`. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the value of `a` at index `s` or `b`. The value of `k` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
