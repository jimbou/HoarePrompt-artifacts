The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is N if nums[N] != num, otherwise s is the last index of the list of integers where nums[index] != num, e is 0, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num. If ppp is 23, the list of integers nums is printed. does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to the input is greater than 0 and _ is now 0.
