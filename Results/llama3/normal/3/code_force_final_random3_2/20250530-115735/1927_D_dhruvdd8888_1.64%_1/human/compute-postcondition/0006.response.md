According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 0.
State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of the original list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, then `arr` is an empty list. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, `num`). `num` is now equal to the first element of the list of integers.**
