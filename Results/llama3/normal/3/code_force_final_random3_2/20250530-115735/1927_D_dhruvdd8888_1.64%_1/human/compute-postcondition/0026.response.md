Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, `s` is `N` if `nums[N] != num`, otherwise `s` is the last index of the list of integers where `nums[index] != num`, `e` is 0, `num` is -1, `LA` is -1 if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, otherwise `LA` is the number of elements in `arr` minus 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs remaining: a list of integers and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, then `arr` is an empty list. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing tuples `(1 + s, i, num)` for each `i` where `nums[i] != num`. If `ppp` is 23, the list of integers `nums` is printed, input is greater than 0, `_` is 0. The current value of `tc` is greater than 5, and if `ppp` is 23, the values of `l` and `r` are printed.***
