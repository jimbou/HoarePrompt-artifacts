Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first element of the original list of integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of N is an integer that was read from stdin, and nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 appended to the end. The variables s and e are initialized to 0. The variable num is assigned the value of the first element of the original list of integers. The variable arr is an empty list. Stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now has three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers.
