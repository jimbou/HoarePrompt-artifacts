Based on the given precondition, let's analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `s` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
* `e` is the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
* `num` is -1.
* `LA` is -1 if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, otherwise `LA` is the number of elements in `arr` minus 1.
* `eli` is the insertion point of `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
* `l` and `r` are integers greater than 1 and `l` is less than or equal to `r`.

Since `num` is -1, and the first element of `nums` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, `LA` will be the number of elements in `arr` minus 1.

The print statement is `print(s - 1, s)`. To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `s`.

`s` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. Since `eli` is the insertion point of `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr` to maintain sorted order, and `l` is greater than 1, `eli` will be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `min(eli, LA)` will be 1, and `s` will be the second element of the tuple at index 1 in `arr`.

However, the exact value of `s` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `arr`. Nevertheless, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **s - 1 (where s is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in arr), s (where s is the second element of the tuple at index 1 in arr)**
