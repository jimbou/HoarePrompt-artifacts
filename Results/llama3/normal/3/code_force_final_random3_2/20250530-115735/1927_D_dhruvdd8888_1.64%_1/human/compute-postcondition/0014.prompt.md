Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first element of the original list of integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N + 1):
    if nums[i] != num:
        arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
        s = i
    num = nums[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is 0, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first element of the original list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num). num is now equal to the first element of the list of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 1 if nums[i] != num, otherwise s is 0, e is 0, num is the second element of the original list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num) and another tuple (2, 1, num) if nums[i] != num, otherwise arr remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 2 if nums[i] != num, otherwise s is 0, e is 0, num is the second element of the original list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num) and another tuple (2, 1, num) if nums[i] != num, otherwise arr contains one tuple (1, 0, num) and another tuple (3, 2, num).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
