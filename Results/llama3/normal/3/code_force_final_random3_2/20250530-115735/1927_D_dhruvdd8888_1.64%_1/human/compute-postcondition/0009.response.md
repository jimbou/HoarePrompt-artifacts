Output State: **N is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 1 if nums[i] != num, otherwise s is 0, e is 0, num is the second element of the original list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num) and another tuple (2, 1, num) if nums[i] != num, otherwise arr remains the same.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to the second element of the original list of integers, which is `nums[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining. The value of `s` is still dependent on whether `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, and the value of `arr` is still dependent on whether the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`.
