Output State: **N is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 2, e is 0, num is the second element of the original list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num) and another tuple (2, 1, num) if nums[i] != num, otherwise arr contains one tuple (1, 0, num) and another tuple (3, 2, num).**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to 2, which is the original value of `i`. The list `arr` has been appended with a new tuple, where the first element is 1 plus the original value of `s`, the second element is the original value of `i`, and the third element is the original value of `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.
