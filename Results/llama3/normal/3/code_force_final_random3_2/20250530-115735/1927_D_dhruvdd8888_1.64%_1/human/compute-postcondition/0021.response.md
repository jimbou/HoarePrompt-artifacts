Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, `s` is `N` if `nums[N] != num`, otherwise `s` is the last index of the list of integers where `nums[index] != num`, `e` is 0, `num` is -1, `LA` is -1 if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, otherwise `LA` is the number of elements in `arr` minus 1, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs remaining: a list of integers and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, then `arr` is an empty list. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing tuples `(1 + s, i, num)` for each `i` where `nums[i] != num`. If `ppp` is 23, the list of integers `nums` is printed, input is greater than 0, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to integers based on the input from stdin, which now contains two inputs remaining. The other variables remain unchanged, with their values still dependent on the initial conditions.
