This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It first reads an integer N and a list of integers, and then creates a list of tuples based on the input. The function then reads additional input pairs of integers and uses the created list to determine the output for each pair. If the first element of the pair is greater than a certain value, it prints -1, -1 or s-1, s. If the first element is not greater, it prints -1, -1 or s, e+1, depending on the value of e. The function continues this process until all input pairs have been processed. If a specific condition (ppp == 23) is met, it prints the list of integers.
