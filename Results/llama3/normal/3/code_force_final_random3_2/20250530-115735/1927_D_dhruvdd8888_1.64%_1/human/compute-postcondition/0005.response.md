Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is 0, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first element of the original list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num). num is now equal to the first element of the list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of num is now equal to the first element of the list of integers. All other variables remain unchanged.
