Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The program first reads the input array and creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of a contiguous subarray with the same elements. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the tuple that corresponds to the range [l, r] and prints the required output.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. If the start index of the tuple is greater than l, it checks if the start index is 1. If it is, it prints -1, -1. Otherwise, it prints s-1, s. If the start index is not greater than l, it checks if the end index is greater than or equal to r. If it is, it prints -1, -1. If the end index is less than N, it prints s, e+1. Otherwise, it prints -1, -1.

The program also handles the case where the first element of the input array is equal to the value of the contiguous subarray. In this case, the list of tuples is empty, and the program correctly handles this case.

The program also handles the case where the input array contains only one element. In this case, the list of tuples contains only one tuple, and the program correctly handles this case.

The program also handles the case where the query range [l, r] is equal to the range of the contiguous subarray. In this case, the program correctly prints s, e+1.

The program also handles the case where the query range [l, r] is not equal to the range of the contiguous subarray. In this case, the program correctly prints -1, -1 or s-1, s.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
