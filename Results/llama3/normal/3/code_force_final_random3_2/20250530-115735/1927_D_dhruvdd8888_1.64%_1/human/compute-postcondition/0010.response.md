According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `N` must be greater than 1.
State: **N is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 1 if nums[i] != num, otherwise s is 0, e is 0, num is the second element of the original list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num) and another tuple (2, 1, num) if nums[i] != num, otherwise arr remains the same.**
