Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by first creating a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end indices of a subarray with the same elements, and the element itself. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the tuple that corresponds to the subarray that contains the query range. If the start index of the subarray is greater than the start of the query range, it means that the query range is contained in a subarray with the same elements, so it prints -1, -1. If the end index of the subarray is greater than or equal to the end of the query range, it means that the query range is contained in a subarray with the same elements, so it prints -1, -1. Otherwise, it prints the start index of the subarray and the index after the end of the subarray, which are two different elements in the query range.

Correctness: **True**
