Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the query range (l, r) is equal to the range of a single element in the array. In this case, the program should return (-1, -1) because there are no two different elements in the range. However, the program returns the indices of the same element, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the query is (1, 1), the program should return (-1, -1) because there is only one element in the range. However, the program returns (1, 1) which is incorrect.

This case is not handled correctly by the program, therefore the correctness is **False**.
