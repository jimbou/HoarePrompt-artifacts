Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, l is the first integer from the input, r is the second integer from the input, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr.**

Explanation: The code consists of two lines. The first line uses the bisect_left function to find the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order and assigns it to eli. The second line unpacks the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr and assigns the second and third elements to s and e respectively. The values of N, i, nums, num, LA, l, and r remain unchanged. The value of eli is newly introduced, and the values of s and e are updated based on the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr.
