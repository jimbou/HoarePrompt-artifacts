Postcondition: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, l and r are integers greater than 1 and l is less than or equal to r, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr. If e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than N, the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr which is s, and the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr which is e plus 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is being printed.**
