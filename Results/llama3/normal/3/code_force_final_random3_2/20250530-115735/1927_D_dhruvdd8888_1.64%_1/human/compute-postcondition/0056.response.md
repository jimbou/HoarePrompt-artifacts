Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, `s` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, `e` is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, `num` is -1, `LA` is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, `l` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases with no input remaining. If `ppp` equals 23, the first integer from the input which is `l` and the second integer from the input which is `r` are being printed.***
