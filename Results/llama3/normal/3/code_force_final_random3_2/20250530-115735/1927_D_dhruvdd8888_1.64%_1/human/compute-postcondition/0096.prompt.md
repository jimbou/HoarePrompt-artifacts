Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is N if nums[N] != num, otherwise s is the last index of the list of integers where nums[index] != num, e is 0, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num. If ppp is 23, the list of integers nums is printed.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, l is an integer, r is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs remaining: a list of integers and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num. If s > l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1 and s are printed. If s is less than or equal to l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than r, then if e is less than N, the value of s and the value of e + 1 are printed. If e is not less than N, -1, -1 are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, l is the first integer from the input, r is the second integer from the input, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, the values -1, -1 are printed. Otherwise, the values s - 1, s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, the values -1 and -1 are printed. If e is less than r, the values of s and e + 1 are printed if e is less than N, otherwise the values -1, -1 are being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, l and r are integers greater than 1 and l is less than or equal to r, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1, s is printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than N, s, e plus 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
