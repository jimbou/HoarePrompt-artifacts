Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is 0, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first element of the original list of integers, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num), stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include a tuple containing the values 1, 0, and `num`, which are the results of the expressions `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`, respectively. The value of `s` has also been updated to be equal to `i`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
