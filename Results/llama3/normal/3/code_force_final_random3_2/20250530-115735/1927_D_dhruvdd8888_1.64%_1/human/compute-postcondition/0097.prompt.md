You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list of integers. The second integer is the number of pairs of integers. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The list of pairs of integers contains pairs of integers between 1 and the length of the list of integers.
    input = sys.stdin.readline

    #State: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is N if nums[N] != num, otherwise s is the last index of the list of integers where nums[index] != num, e is 0, num is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num.

If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num. If ppp is 23, the list of integers nums is printed.

If s is greater than the first integer from the input, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1, s is printed. If s is not greater than the first integer from the input, then if e is greater than or equal to the second integer from the input, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than N, s, e plus 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is N if nums[N] != num, otherwise s is the last index of the list of integers where nums[index] != num, e is 0, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num. The current value of ppp is 23, and the list of integers nums is being printed.

Case_2: N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, stdin is empty, and the values of l and r are not defined. If s is greater than the first integer from the input, then if s is equal to 1, -1, -1 is printed. Otherwise, s - 1, s is printed. If s is not greater than the first integer from the input, then if e is greater than or equal to the second integer from the input, -1, -1 is printed. If e is less than N, s, e plus 1 are printed. Otherwise, -1, -1 is printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
