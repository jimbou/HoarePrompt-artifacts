Output State: **N is an integer greater than 0, i is 1, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is 1, e is 0, num is the first element of the original list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, num) and another tuple (2, 1, num).**

Explanation:
The first line appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple contains the value of `1 + s`, which is 1 since `s` is 0, the value of `i`, which is 1, and the value of `num`, which is the first element of the original list of integers. If the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, then `arr` is an empty list. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing one tuple (1, 0, `num`) and another tuple (2, 1, `num`).

The second line assigns the value of `i` to `s`, making `s` equal to 1.

No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `N` remains an integer greater than 0, `i` remains 1, `nums` remains a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, `e` remains 0, and `num` remains the first element of the original list of integers. The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers.
