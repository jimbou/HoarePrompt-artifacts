Output: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, l is an integer, r is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases with two inputs remaining: a list of integers and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num. The current value of s is 1 and is higher than the current value of l, and -1, -1 is printed**
