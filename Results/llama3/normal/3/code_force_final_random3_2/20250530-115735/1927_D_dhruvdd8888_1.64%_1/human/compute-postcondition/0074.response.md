The only variable in the loop head is the loop counter `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of the input. At the end of the last iteration, the loop counter `_` is not explicitly mentioned, but we know that it is incremented by 1 after each iteration. So, for the loop to execute again, the loop counter `_` must be less than the input value.

However, since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we cannot adjust its value directly. Instead, we can adjust the state of the input value.

State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, l is the first integer from the input, r is the second integer from the input, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr. If s is greater than l, then if s is equal to 1, the values -1, -1 are printed. Otherwise, the values s - 1, s are printed. If s is not greater than l, then if e is greater than or equal to r, the values -1 and -1 are printed. If e is less than r, the values of s and e + 1 are printed if e is less than N, otherwise the values -1, -1 are being printed. The input value must be greater than 1**
