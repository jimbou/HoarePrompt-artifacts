Output: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `N`, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, `s` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `num` is -1, `LA` is -1 if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, otherwise `LA` is the number of elements in `arr` minus 1, `l` and `r` are integers greater than 1 and `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `eli` is the insertion point of `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr` to maintain sorted order, `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`. If `s` is greater than `l`, then if `s` is equal to 1, the values -1, -1 are printed. Otherwise, the values `s - 1, s` are printed. If `s` is not greater than `l`, then if `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, the values -1 and -1 are printed. If `e` is less than `r`, the values of `s` and `e + 1` are printed if `e` is less than `N`, otherwise the values -1, -1 are being printed. and this is printed: "l" and "r" which are integers greater than 1 and `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
