Output State: **N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is N if nums[N] != num, otherwise s is the last index of the list of integers where nums[index] != num, e is 0, num is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. If the first element of nums is equal to num, then arr is an empty list. Otherwise, arr is a list containing tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums[i] != num.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of N remains unchanged.
*   The loop counter i reaches the value of N.
*   The list of integers nums remains unchanged.
*   The value of s is updated to the last index where nums\[index\] != num. If no such index exists, s remains 0.
*   The value of e remains unchanged at 0.
*   The value of num is updated to -1, which is the last element of the list of integers.
*   The stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases with three inputs remaining.
*   The list arr contains tuples (1 + s, i, num) for each i where nums\[i\] != num. If no such i exists, arr remains an empty list.
