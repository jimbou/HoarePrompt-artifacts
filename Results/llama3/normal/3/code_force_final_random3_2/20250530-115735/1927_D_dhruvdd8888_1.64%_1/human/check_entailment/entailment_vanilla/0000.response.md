Reasoning:  
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in an array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program uses a technique of grouping consecutive equal elements in the array and storing their start and end indices in a list `arr`. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the appropriate group in `arr` that overlaps with the query range `[l, r]`. If such a group is found, it checks if the end of the group is within the query range. If it is, it prints the start and end indices of the group. If not, it prints `-1 -1`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1.  The function `func_1` is called without being defined. It should be defined before it's called.
2.  The variable `ppp` is used but not defined. It seems like it's supposed to be the test case number, but it's not clear how it's being used.
3.  The line `if tc > 5:` is used to skip the rest of the function if the number of test cases is greater than 5. This seems arbitrary and might not be the intended behavior.
4.  The line `if ppp == 23:` is used to print some debug information, but it's not clear why this specific test case is being targeted.

Despite these issues, the program's logic for solving the problem is correct. It correctly groups consecutive equal elements, uses binary search to find the appropriate group for each query, and prints the correct indices.

Correctness: **False**
