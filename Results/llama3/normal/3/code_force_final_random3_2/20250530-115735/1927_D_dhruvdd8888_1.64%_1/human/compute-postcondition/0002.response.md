Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of the original list of integers, `arr` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer, a list of integers, and a list of pairs of integers. The current value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`***
