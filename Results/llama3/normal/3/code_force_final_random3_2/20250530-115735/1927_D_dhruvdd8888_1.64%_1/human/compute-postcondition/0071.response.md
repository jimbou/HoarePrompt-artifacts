Postcondition: ***N is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is N, nums is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end, s is the value of the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the value of the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, num is -1, LA is -1 if the first element of nums is equal to num, otherwise LA is the number of elements in arr minus 1, l is the first integer from the input, r is the second integer from the input, eli is the insertion point of (l, 0, 0) in arr to maintain sorted order, s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr. If e is less than N, the values of s and e + 1 are printed. Otherwise, the values -1, -1 are being printed.***
