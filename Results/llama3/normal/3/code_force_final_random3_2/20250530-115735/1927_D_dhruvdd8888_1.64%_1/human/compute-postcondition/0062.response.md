Based on the given initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

* `s` is the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
* `e` is the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
* `num` is -1.
* `LA` is -1 if the first element of `nums` is equal to `num`, otherwise `LA` is the number of elements in `arr` minus 1.
* `eli` is the insertion point of `(l, 0, 0)` in `arr` to maintain sorted order.
* `l` is the first integer from the input.
* `r` is the second integer from the input.

Since `num` is -1, and the first element of `nums` is not equal to -1 (as it is a list of integers between 1 and 10^6 with an additional element -1 at the end), `LA` is the number of elements in `arr` minus 1.

The `print` statement prints `s - 1` and `s`. Since `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `e` is the third element of the same tuple, we can infer that `s` and `e` are related to the tuple at the insertion point `eli` in `arr`.

However, without knowing the exact values of `arr`, `l`, and `r`, we cannot determine the exact values of `s` and `e`. Nevertheless, we can describe the output as:

Output: **s - 1 (where s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr), s (where s is the second element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
