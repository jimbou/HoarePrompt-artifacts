Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, the string '?' along with the value of `maxi` (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`), the value of `maxi` again (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`), the value of `i`, and the value of `i` again, is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 1. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing a single element 1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, and `res` is a string containing '=' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 1. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and `res` is a string containing '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 1, and `res` is not equal to '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 2, `res` is a string containing either '<', '=' or '?', `arr` is a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2. The string '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed if `res` is not '<'. If `res` is '=', an additional element 2 is added to the list `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 3, `res` is either '<', '=' or '?', and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If `res` is '=', `arr` is updated to contain an additional element 3. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged, containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
