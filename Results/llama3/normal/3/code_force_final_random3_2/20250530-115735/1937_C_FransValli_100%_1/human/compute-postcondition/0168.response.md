To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `stdin` contains no input, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` and `i` are unchanged.**
