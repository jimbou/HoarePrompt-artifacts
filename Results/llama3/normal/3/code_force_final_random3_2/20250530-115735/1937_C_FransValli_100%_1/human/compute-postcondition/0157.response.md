Based on the initial state, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)`

Here's what we know from the initial state:

* `n` is greater than or equal to 1
* `i` is equal to `n`
* `arr` has at least `n-1` elements
* `item` is the last element of `arr`
* `res` is either '>' or not '>'
* If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`.

Now, let's look at the print statement:

* `!` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `maxi` is not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its value. However, based on the context, it's likely that `maxi` is the maximum value in the `arr` list. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, then `arr` has at least one element, and `maxi` would be the maximum value among those elements.
* `mini` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`, which is `item`. Otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `arr` and `res`, we can't determine the exact values of `maxi` and `mini`. However, we can describe their values based on the given information.

Output: **! [maxi] [mini] (where maxi is the maximum value in the arr list, and mini is either the last element of arr if res is '>', or the second element of arr otherwise)**
