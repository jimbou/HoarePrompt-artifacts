Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `arr` is a list containing a single element 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 3, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated to be the input from stdin, which is either '<' or not '<'. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state still includes the information about the previous output and prints, as well as the values of the other variables. Note that `res` is returned twice, and its value is also printed twice.
