Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, the string '?' along with the value of `maxi` (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`), the value of `maxi` again (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`), the value of `i`, and the value of `i` again, is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variables `n` and `maxi` retain their initial values, a new list `arr` is created with a single element 0, and the printing of the strings with the specified values continues as before.
