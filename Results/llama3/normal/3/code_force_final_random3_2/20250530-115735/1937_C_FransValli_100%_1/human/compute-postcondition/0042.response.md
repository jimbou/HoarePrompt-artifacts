To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3
* `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive)
* `i` is 2
* `res` is a string containing either '<', '=' or '?'
* `arr` is a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2

Since the loop head only involves the variable `i` and `n`, we can only adjust these two variables.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`maxi`, `res`, and `arr`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 3, `res` is a string containing either '<', '=' or '?', `arr` is a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2**
