Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 3, `res` is either '<', '=' or '?', `arr` is a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2, and stdin contains no input.**

The value of `res` is updated to the input value, which can be either '<', '=' or '?'. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to get the input value for `res`.
