According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input is an integer greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 1) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the input is an integer greater than 1.
State: **stdin contains one input: an integer greater than 1**
