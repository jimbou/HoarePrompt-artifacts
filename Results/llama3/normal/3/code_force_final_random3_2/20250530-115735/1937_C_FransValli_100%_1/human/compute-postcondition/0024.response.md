Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `maxi`. However, we know that `maxi` is an integer within a specific range.
* `arr` is a list containing a single element 0. Therefore, `arr[0]` is 0.
* `i` is 1.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`

The print statement will output a string that includes the following elements:

* The string '?'.
* The value of `maxi`, which is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive).
* The value of `arr[0]`, which is 0.
* The value of `maxi` again.
* The value of `i`, which is 1.

Since the exact value of `maxi` is not provided, we can't determine the exact output of the print statement. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where maxi is an integer between 0 and n-1, inclusive)**
