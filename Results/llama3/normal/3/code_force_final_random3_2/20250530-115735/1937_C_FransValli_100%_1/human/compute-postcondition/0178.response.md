Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is the input string, `maxi` is either 3 or unchanged, `i` is either 3 or unchanged, and the current output is either ? 0 0 1 1 [3] [3] [3] [3] or ? 0 0 1 1 [3] [3] [3] [3] or ? 0 0 1 1 [i] [i] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [3] [3] [3] [3] or ? [3] [3] [3] [3] or ? [i] [i] [i] [i], stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` is updated to be either 3 or unchanged, because `i` is either 3 or unchanged. The current output and the printed output are also updated accordingly. The values of the other variables remain the same.
