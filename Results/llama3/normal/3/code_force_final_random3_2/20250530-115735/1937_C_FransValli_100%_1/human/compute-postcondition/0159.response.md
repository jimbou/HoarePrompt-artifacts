The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin.  If the stdin has at least one input the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains no input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must have at least one input.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least `n-1` elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains at least one input**
