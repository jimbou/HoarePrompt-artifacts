Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', if `res` is '<', then `mini` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1`, and `maxi` is 1, if `res` is '=', then `mini` is 0, `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and `n-2`, and `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`, if `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-2`, and `maxi` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`, `mini` is equal to the second element of `arr`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of the second element of `arr` twice, followed by the value of the second element of `arr` twice, stdin contains no input. If `res` is '>', then the conditions are met. Otherwise, no additional conditions are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the fourth element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` (either the third or second element of `arr`), the value of `mini` again, the value of `item` (the fourth element of `arr`), and the value of `item` again




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
