The only objects in the loop head are variables  item and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 elements, item is the second element of arr. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the item is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `res` is a string, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is equal to `item`.**
