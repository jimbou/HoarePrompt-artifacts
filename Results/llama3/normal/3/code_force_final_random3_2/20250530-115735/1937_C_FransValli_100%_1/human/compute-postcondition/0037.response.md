Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 2, `res` is a string containing either '<', '=' or '?', `arr` is a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, and the string '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed if `res` is not '<'.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of `n`, `maxi`, and `i` remain the same. The value of `res` is updated to a string containing either '<', '=' or '?', which is obtained from the input. The value of `arr` is also updated based on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `arr` contains a single element 1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` contains two elements 0 and 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains a single element 0. Additionally, if `res` is not '<', then the string '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed.
