Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string (the new input from stdin), `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is an empty list, `res` is either '<' or not '<', and `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and the printed values are '?' , [1], [1], [1], [1]. Otherwise, if `maxi` is `k`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, the printed values are '?' , [k], [k], [k], [k].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` remains the same, which is greater than or equal to 1.
*   The value of `i` becomes `n` after the loop finishes executing.
*   The value of `res` is still a string that represents the new input from stdin.
*   The value of `mini` remains the same, which is an integer between 0 and 99, or `n-1`.
*   The value of `arr` remains an empty list.
*   The value of `res` can be either '<' or not '<'.
*   The value of `maxi` can be any integer between 1 and `n-1`.
*   If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1, and the printed values are '?' , [1], [1], [1], [1].
*   If `maxi` is `k`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, then the printed values are '?' , [k], [k], [k], [k].
