Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `?`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `maxi`: The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<' or '>', then `maxi` is 1. If `res` is '=', then `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 3, `maxi` can take on any value from 1 to `n-1` when `res` is '='.
* `arr[0]`: The value of `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `arr` contains a single element 2, so `arr[0]` is 2. If `res` is '>', then `arr` contains a single element 1, so `arr[0]` is 1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` contains two elements 0 and 1, so `arr[0]` is 0.
* `maxi` (again): This is the same as the first `maxi` and will have the same value.
* `i`: The value of `i` is given as 3.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:

* '?' (a literal string)
* The value of `maxi`, which depends on the value of `res` (either 1 or a value between 1 and `n-1`)
* The value of `arr[0]`, which depends on the value of `res` (either 2, 1, or 0)
* The value of `maxi` again (same as the first `maxi`)
* The value of `i`, which is 3

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3** (where [maxi] is either 1 or a value between 1 and `n-1`, and [arr[0]] is either 2, 1, or 0, depending on the value of `res`)
