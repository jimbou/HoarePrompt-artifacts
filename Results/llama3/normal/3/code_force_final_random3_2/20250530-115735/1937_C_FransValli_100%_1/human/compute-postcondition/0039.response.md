Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 2, `res` is a string containing either '<', '=' or '?', `arr` is a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0 and an additional element 2, and the string '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed if `res` is not '<'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, `maxi` is still between 0 and `n-1`, `i` is still 2, `res` is still either '<', '=' or '?', and `arr` now has an additional element 2 appended to it. The print statement remains the same, printing the string '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, but only if `res` is not '<'.
