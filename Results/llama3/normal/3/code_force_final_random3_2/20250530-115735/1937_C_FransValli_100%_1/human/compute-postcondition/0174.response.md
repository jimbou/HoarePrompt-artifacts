The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is a string. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2, `i` is 3, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [2] [2] [2] [2]. Otherwise, `maxi` is either 1 or unchanged, `i` is either 3 or unchanged, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]**
