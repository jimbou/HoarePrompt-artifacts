Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` (either the third or second element of `arr`), the value of `mini` again, the value of `item` (the fourth element of `arr`), and the value of `item` again**

In this output state, the value of `res` is updated to either '>' or not '>', which affects the value of `mini`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element of `arr`, otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `item` remain unchanged. Additionally, the specified string is printed, which includes the value of `mini` (either the third or second element of `arr`) and the value of `item` (the fourth element of `arr`).
