To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is 1**
