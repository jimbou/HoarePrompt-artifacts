Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 3, `res` is either '<', '=' or '?', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element 3, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and stdin still contains no input.
