The code prints a string containing several values: '?' , the value of `maxi`, the first element of the list `arr` (which is 0), the value of `maxi` again, and the value of `i` (which is 1). The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is printed immediately.

Since `res` is either '<' or not '<', there are two possible scenarios:

1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1. In this case, the printed values are '?' , [1], [1], [1], [1].
2. If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`. In this case, the printed values are '?' , [k], [k], [k], [k], where `k` is the value of `maxi`.

Output: **? [maxi] 0 [maxi] 1 (where maxi is either 1 or an integer between 2 and n-1)**
