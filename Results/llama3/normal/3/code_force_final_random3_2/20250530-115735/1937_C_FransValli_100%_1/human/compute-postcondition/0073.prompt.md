You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is `n`, `res` is a string (the new input from stdin), `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, and `arr` is either a list containing a single element `n-1`, or a list containing two elements `n-1` and `n-1`, or a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2, or a single element 3, or a single element 4, or a single element 5, or a single element 6, or a single element 7, or a single element 8, or a single element 9, or a single element 10, or a single element 11, or a single element 12, or a single element 13, or a single element 14, or a single element 15, or a single element 16, or a single element 17, or a single element 18, or a single element 19, or a single element 20, or a single element 21, or a single element 22, or a single element 23, or a single element 24, or a single element 25, or a single element 26, or a single element 27, or a single element 28, or a single element 29, or a single element 30, or a single element 31, or a single element 32, or a single element 33, or a single element 34, or a single element 35, or a single element 36, or a single element 37, or a single element 38, or a single element 39, or a single element 40, or a single element 41, or a single element 42, or a single element 43, or a single element 44, or a single element 45, or a single element 46, or a single element 47, or a single element 48, or a single element 49, or a single element 50, or a single element 51, or a single element 52, or a single element 53, or a single element 54, or a single element 55, or a single element 56, or a single element 57, or a single element 58, or a single element 59, or a single element 60, or a single element 61, or a single element 62, or a single element 63, or a single element 64, or a single element 65, or a single element 66, or a single element 67, or a single element 68, or a single element 69, or a single element 70, or a single element 71, or a single element 72, or a single element 73, or a single element 74, or a single element 75, or a single element 76, or a single element 77, or a single element 78, or a single element 79, or a single element 80, or a single element 81, or a single element 82, or a single element 83, or a single element 84, or a single element 85, or a single element 86, or a single element 87, or a single element 88, or a single element 89, or a single element 90, or a single element 91, or a single element 92, or a single element 93, or a single element 94, or a single element 95, or a single element 96, or a single element 97, or a single element 98, or a single element 99, or a single element 100, or a single element 101, or a single element 102, or a single element 103, or a single element 104, or a single element 105, or a single element 106, or a single element 107, or a single element 108, or a single element 109, or a single element 110, or a single element 111, or a single element 112, or a single element 113, or a single element 114, or a single element 115, or a single element 116, or a single element 117, or a single element 118, or a single element 119, or a single element 120, or a single element 121, or a single element 122, or a single element 123, or a single element 124, or a single element 125, or a single element 126, or a single element 127, or a single element 128, or a single element 129, or a single element 130, or a single element 131, or a single element 132, or a single element 133, or a single element 134, or a single element 135, or a single element 136, or a single element 137, or a single element 138, or a single element 139, or a single element 140, or a single element 141, or a single element 142, or a single element 143, or a single element 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the item is the trird element in the list. The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mini`, the value of `mini` again, the value of `item`, and the value of `item` again, with the flush parameter set to True.
