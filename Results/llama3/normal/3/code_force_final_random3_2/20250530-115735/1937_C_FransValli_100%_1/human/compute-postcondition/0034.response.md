To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `maxi`, `arr`, and `res` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 2. If `res` is '<', then `arr` is a list containing a single element 1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, and `res` is a string containing '=' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 2. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and `res` is a string containing '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 2, and `res` is not equal to '<'.**
