Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is an input from the user, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the fourth element of `arr`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of the fourth element of `arr` twice, followed by the value of the fourth element of `arr` twice, stdin contains no input. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
