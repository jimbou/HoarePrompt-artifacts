Output State: **The loop will execute until the initial input integer is reached, and the final output state will be the last printed statement '! [maxi] [mini]', where 'maxi' is the maximum value found in the last iteration and 'mini' is the minimum value found in the last iteration.**

In natural language, the loop will continue to execute until it has iterated the number of times specified by the initial input integer. In each iteration, it will find the maximum and minimum values within the range of the current iteration. The final output state will be the last printed statement, which will contain the maximum and minimum values found in the last iteration.
