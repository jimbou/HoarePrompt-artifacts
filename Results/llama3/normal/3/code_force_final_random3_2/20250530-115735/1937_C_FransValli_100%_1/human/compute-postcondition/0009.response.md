The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `maxi` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains one input: a string, `i` is 2, `res` is either '<' or not '<', and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1, otherwise `maxi` remains 0.**
