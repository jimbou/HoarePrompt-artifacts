Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 3, `res` is either '<', '=' or '?', and stdin contains no input. If `res` is '<', `arr` is a list containing a single element 3. If `res` is '=', `arr` is updated to contain an additional element 3. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged, containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2.***
