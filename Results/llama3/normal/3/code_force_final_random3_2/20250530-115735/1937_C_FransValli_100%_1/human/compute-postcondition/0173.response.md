Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is a string. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2, `i` is 2, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [2] [2] [2] [2]. Otherwise, `maxi` is either 1 or unchanged, `i` is either 2 or unchanged, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i].***
