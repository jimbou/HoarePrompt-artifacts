Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 1, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to a list containing a single element 1, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output and print statements are still the same. The value of `res` is still '<' and is returned.
