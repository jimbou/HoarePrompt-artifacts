Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `maxi` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `res` is a string, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1, otherwise `maxi` remains 0, and the string '?' along with the value of `maxi` (either 0 or 1), the value of `maxi` again (either 0 or 1), the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `i` again which is 2, is printed, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `n` remains an integer greater than 2, the value of `maxi` is either 0 or 1, the value of `i` is 2, and the value of `res` is a string. The string '?' along with the value of `maxi` (either 0 or 1), the value of `maxi` again (either 0 or 1), the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `i` again which is 2, is printed. The stdin is empty because it contained one input: a string which has been used by the input() function.
