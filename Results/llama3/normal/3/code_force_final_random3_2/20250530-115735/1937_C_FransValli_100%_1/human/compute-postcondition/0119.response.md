The code prints a string containing several values: '?' , the value of `maxi`, the first element of the list `arr`, the value of `maxi` again, and the value of `i`. 

The value of `maxi` is either 1 (when `res` is '<' or '='), or an integer between 2 and `n-1` (when `res` is not '='). 

The first element of the list `arr` is either 1 (when `res` is '<'), or 0 (when `res` is '=' or not '='). 

The value of `i` is 2.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 2 (where maxi is the value of maxi and arr[0] is the first element of the list arr)**
