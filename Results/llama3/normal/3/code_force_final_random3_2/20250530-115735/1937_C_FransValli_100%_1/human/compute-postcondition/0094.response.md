The code prints a string with a '?' character, followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and the value of `i` twice. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is printed immediately.

Since `maxi` can be either 0, 1, or 2, and `i` is 2, the possible outputs are:

- If `maxi` is 0, the output will be: `? 0 0 2 2`
- If `maxi` is 1, the output will be: `? 1 1 2 2`
- If `maxi` is 2, the output will be: `? 2 2 2 2`

However, the precondition also states that if `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1. Therefore, if `res` is '<', the output will be: `? 1 1 2 2`

Since we don't know the exact value of `res`, we can't determine the exact output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a string with a '?' character, followed by the value of `maxi` twice, and the value of `i` twice.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is either 0, 1, or 2, and i is 2)**
