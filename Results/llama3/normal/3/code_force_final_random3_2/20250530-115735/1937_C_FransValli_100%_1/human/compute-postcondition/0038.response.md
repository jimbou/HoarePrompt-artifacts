Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 2, `res` is a string containing either '<', '=' or '?', `arr` is a list containing a single element 2, and the string '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 2 is being printed if `res` is not '<'.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` assigns a new list containing a single element `i` to the variable `arr`. Since `i` is 2, the new list contains only the element 2. The other variables `n`, `maxi`, `res` are not affected by this code. The print statement is also not affected, as it is printing the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`, which are still valid.
