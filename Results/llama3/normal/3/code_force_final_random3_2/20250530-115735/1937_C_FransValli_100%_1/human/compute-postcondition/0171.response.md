Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is a string, `maxi` is either 1 or unchanged, `i` is either 2 or unchanged, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]**.

In this output state, the value of `res` is a string that is input from the user, and its value is not specified. The values of `maxi` and `i` depend on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` and `i` are unchanged. The current output is updated to include the values of `maxi` and `i`. The other variables, `n`, `arr`, and `item`, are not affected by the code and remain the same.
