Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least `n-1` elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the value of `n` remains the same, `i` is still equal to `n`, and the list `arr` has at least `n-1` elements. The variable `item` is now the last element of `arr`, and `res` can be either '>' or not '>'. The standard input is empty. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is updated to the last element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` remains the second element of `arr`.
