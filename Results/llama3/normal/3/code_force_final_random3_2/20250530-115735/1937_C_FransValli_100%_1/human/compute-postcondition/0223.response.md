Postcondition: **`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is an input from the user, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`. The current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is equal to `item`, and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. Otherwise, the output remains unchanged.**
