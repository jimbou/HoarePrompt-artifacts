Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 3, `res` is either '<', '=' or '?', `arr` is a list containing either a single element 1 and 3, two elements 0 and 1 and 3, or a single element 0 and 3, or a single element 2 and 3, and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3. The value of `maxi` is still an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive). The value of `i` is still 3. The value of `res` is still either '<', '=' or '?'. The list `arr` now contains an additional element 3, appended to its original contents. The stdin still contains no input.
