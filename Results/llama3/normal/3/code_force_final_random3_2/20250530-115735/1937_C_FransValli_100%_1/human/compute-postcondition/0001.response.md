Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, maxi is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer greater than 1, which was obtained from the input. The variable `maxi` is initialized to 0. Stdin is empty because it contained only one input, which was consumed by the `input()` function.
