The only objects in the loop head are variables  item and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 3 elements, item is the third element of arr. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the item is the fourth element of arr.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is an input from the user, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`.**
