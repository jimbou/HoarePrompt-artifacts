Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index `maxi` of the maximum value in the permutation `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done in `n-1` queries.

2. Then, it finds all indices `arr` that have the same maximum value as `maxi`. This is done in `n-1` queries.

3. Next, it finds the index `mini` of the minimum value among the indices in `arr`. This is done in `len(arr)-1` queries, which is at most `n-1` queries.

4. Finally, it prints the pair of indices `maxi` and `mini` that maximize the XOR operation.

The total number of queries is at most `3n-3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.

The program correctly finds a pair of indices that maximize the XOR operation, and it does so within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
