Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`, `mini` is equal to the second element of `arr`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of the second element of `arr` twice, followed by the value of the second element of `arr` twice, stdin contains no input.
