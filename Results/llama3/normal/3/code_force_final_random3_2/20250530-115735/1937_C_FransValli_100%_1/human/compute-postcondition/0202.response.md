Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `maxi` can be either `n-1` (which is at least 3) or the original value of `maxi` (which is not specified). For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume `maxi` is `n-1`.
* `arr` is a list containing either a single element 2, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0 and then 2. Since `res` is either '<' or not '<', we will consider both cases:
	+ If `res` is '<', `arr` contains a single element 2.
	+ If `res` is not '<', `arr` contains either two elements 0 and 1 or a single element 0 and then 2.
* `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`. This implies that `arr` has at least two elements.
* `i` is 3.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`

* `maxi` is printed twice, with the value of `n-1` (which is at least 3).
* `arr[0]` is printed, which is the first element of the list `arr`. Based on the possible values of `arr`, this can be either 2 (if `res` is '<'), 0 (if `res` is not '<' and `arr` contains two elements), or 0 (if `res` is not '<' and `arr` contains a single element 0 and then 2).
* `i` is printed, with the value of 3.

Considering the possible values of `arr` and `res`, the output can be one of the following:

* If `res` is '<', the output is: `? [n-1] 2 [n-1] 3`
* If `res` is not '<' and `arr` contains two elements, the output is: `? [n-1] 0 [n-1] 3`
* If `res` is not '<' and `arr` contains a single element 0 and then 2, the output is: `? [n-1] 0 [n-1] 3`

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `res` and the structure of `arr` based on the initial state, we will provide a general description of the output:

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i] (where maxi is n-1, arr[0] is either 2, 0, or 0, and i is 3)**
