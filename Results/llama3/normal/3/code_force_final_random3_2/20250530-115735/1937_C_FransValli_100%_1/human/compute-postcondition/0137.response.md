To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `item` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, we have the following states:

* `n` is greater than or equal to 1
* `i` is `n`
* `res` is either '<', '=', or '>'
* If `res` is '<', then `mini` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1`, and `maxi` is 1
* If `res` is '=', then `mini` is 0, `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and `n-2`, and `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`
* If `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-2`, and `maxi` is 1

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to have at least 2 elements. We can do this by setting `arr` to have at least 2 elements, regardless of the value of `res`. We can also set `item` to be the second element of `arr`, since the loop will iterate over `arr[1:]`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', `arr` has at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element of `arr**, `mini` is either `n-1`, 0, or `n-2`, `maxi` is either 1, or either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`**

Note that we didn't change the states of `mini` and `maxi` since they are not part of the loop head.
