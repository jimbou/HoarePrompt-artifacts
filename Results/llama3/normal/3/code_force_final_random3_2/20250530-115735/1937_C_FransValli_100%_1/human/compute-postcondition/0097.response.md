Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 2, `res` is a string (the new input from stdin), `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or n-1, and `arr` is an empty list, and this is printed: '?' , [2], [2], [2], [2]. If res is '<', then maxi is 1 and the printed values are '?' , [1], [1], [1], [1].**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed values have also been updated to reflect the new value of `maxi`.
