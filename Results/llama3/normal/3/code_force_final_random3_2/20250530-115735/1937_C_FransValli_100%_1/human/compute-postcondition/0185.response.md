Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 1, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is either '>' or not '>', which is determined by the input from the user. The other variables remain unchanged. The current output and the printed message are also updated accordingly. Note that `res` is returned, indicating that its value is now available for further processing.
