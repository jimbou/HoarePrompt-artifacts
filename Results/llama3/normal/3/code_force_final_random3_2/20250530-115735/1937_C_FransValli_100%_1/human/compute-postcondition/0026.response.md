Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `i` is 1, `res` is a string containing '?' followed by the value of `maxi` which is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi` which is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), followed by the value of `i` which is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2. The value of `maxi` remains an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive). The list `arr` still contains a single element 0. The value of `i` remains 1. A new variable `res` is introduced, which is a string containing a specific sequence of characters: '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, then the first element of the list `arr` (which is 0), then the value of `maxi` again, and finally the value of `i`.
