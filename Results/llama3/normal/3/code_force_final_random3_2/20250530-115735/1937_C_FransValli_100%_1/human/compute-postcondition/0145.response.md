The code prints a string that starts with '?', followed by the value of `mini` twice, and then the value of `item` twice. `mini` is equal to the second element of `arr`, and `item` is equal to the third element of `arr`. Since `arr` has at least 3 elements, `mini` and `item` are well-defined.

Output: **? [second element of arr] [second element of arr] [third element of arr] [third element of arr]**
