Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is an input from the user, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is equal to `item`, and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item].**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be a string input from the user. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `mini` and the printed output are still dependent on the value of `res`.
