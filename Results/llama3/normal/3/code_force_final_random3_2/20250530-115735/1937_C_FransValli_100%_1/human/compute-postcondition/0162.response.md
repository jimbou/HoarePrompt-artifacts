Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects involved in the print statement.

* `maxi` is 0, as specified in the initial state.
* `i` is 1, as specified in the initial state.
* `flush=True` is a parameter that forces the output buffer to be flushed immediately, but it doesn't affect the output itself.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string '?' followed by the values of `maxi` and `i`, which are both 0 and 1, respectively.

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
