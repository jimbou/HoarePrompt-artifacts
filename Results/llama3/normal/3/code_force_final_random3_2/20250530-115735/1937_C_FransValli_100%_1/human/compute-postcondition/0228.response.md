Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is an input from the user, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `mini` is the fourth element of `arr`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of the fourth element of `arr` twice, followed by the value of the fourth element of `arr` twice, stdin contains no input:**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for `mini`, which is now assigned the value of the fourth element of `arr`, which is also the value of `item`. The program also prints a string consisting of '?' followed by the value of `mini` (which is the fourth element of `arr`) twice, followed by the value of `item` (which is the same as `mini`) twice. The stdin is now empty as it has been used to provide input for `res`.
