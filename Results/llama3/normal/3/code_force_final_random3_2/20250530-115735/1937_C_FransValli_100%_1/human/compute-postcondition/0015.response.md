To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 at the end of each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1, making it 3.

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `res`, `maxi`, and the printed output, are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is a string, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2, otherwise `maxi` is either 0 or 1, and the string '?' along with the value of `maxi` (either 0, 1 or 2), the value of `maxi` again (either 0, 1 or 2), the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `i` again which is 2, is printed, stdin is empty**
