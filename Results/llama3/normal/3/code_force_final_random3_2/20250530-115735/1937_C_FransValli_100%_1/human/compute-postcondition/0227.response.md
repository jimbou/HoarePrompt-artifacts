Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is an input from the user, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of `mini` twice, followed by the value of `item` twice, stdin contains one input: a string**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to be a string that is an input from the user. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one input: a string, which was not present in the initial state.
