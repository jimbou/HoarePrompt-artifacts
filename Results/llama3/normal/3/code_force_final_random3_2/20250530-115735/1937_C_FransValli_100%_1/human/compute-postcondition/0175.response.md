The code prints a string that starts with '?' followed by the values of `maxi` and `i`. 

Based on the precondition, if `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `maxi` is either 1 or unchanged and `i` is either 3 or unchanged.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can't determine the exact values of `maxi` and `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string '?' followed by two occurrences of `maxi` and two occurrences of `i`.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is either 1 or 2 and i is either 3 or unchanged)**
