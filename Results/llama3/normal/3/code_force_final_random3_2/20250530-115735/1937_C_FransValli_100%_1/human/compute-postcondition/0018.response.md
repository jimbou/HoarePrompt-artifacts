Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or ' ' or any other character, `maxi` is either 0 or 1 or 2, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: '?' along with the value of `maxi` (either 0, 1 or 2), the value of `maxi` again (either 0, 1 or 2), the value of `i` which is 3, and the value of `i` again which is 3.**

The value of `res` is updated to the input character, which can be any character. The value of `maxi` is still either 0, 1, or 2, depending on the value of `res`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin is empty since the input has been read. The printed statements remain the same.
