Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `stdin` is empty, and for each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, the string '?' along with the value of `maxi` (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`), the value of `maxi` again (either 0, 1, 2, ..., `n-1`), the value of `i`, and the value of `i` again, is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, `maxi` will be the maximum value of `i` that was less than the input `res` (or 0 if no such `i` was found), the standard input `stdin` will be empty, and a series of strings will have been printed to the standard output, each string representing a query with the current maximum value and the current iteration number.
