Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables `maxi` and `i` as follows:

* If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and `i` is 2.
* Otherwise, `maxi` and `i` are unchanged.

Since the precondition does not specify the value of `res`, we cannot determine the exact values of `maxi` and `i`. However, we can describe the possible values of `maxi` and `i` based on the condition.

The `print` statement will print the string '?' followed by the values of `maxi`, `maxi`, `i`, and `i`, with `flush=True` to ensure the output is displayed immediately.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where maxi is either 1 or its previous value, and i is either 2 or its previous value, depending on the value of res)**
