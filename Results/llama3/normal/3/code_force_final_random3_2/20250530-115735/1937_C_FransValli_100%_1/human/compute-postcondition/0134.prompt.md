Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is a string (the new input from stdin), `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `res` is either '<' or not '<', and `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and the printed values are '?' , [1], [1], [1], [1]. Otherwise, if `maxi` is `k`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, the printed values are '?' , [k], [k], [k], [k].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. If `res` is '<', then `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1, `maxi` is 1. The printed values are '?' , [1], [1], [1], [1]. If `res` is '=', then `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`. If `maxi` is `k`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, the printed values are '?' , [k], [k], [k], [k], and this is printed: '?' , [maxi], [arr[0]], [maxi], [i]. If `res` is not '=', then `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`. If `maxi` is `k`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, the printed values are '?' , [k], [k], [k], [k], and this is printed: '?' , [maxi], [arr[0]], [maxi], [i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', if `res` is '<', then `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 2 if `res` is '<', a single element 1 if `res` is '>', and two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', `maxi` is 1 if `res` is '<' or '>', and either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1` if `res` is '='. The printed values are '?' , [maxi], [arr[0]], [maxi], [i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', if `res` is '<', then `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 3 if `res` is '<', a single element 2 if `res` is '<' or a single element 1 if `res` is '>', and two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', `maxi` is 1 if `res` is '<' or '>', and either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1` if `res` is '='. The following is printed: '?' , [maxi], [arr[0]], [maxi], [i]. If `res` is '=', the list `arr` now contains an additional element `i` which is 3. Otherwise, the list `arr` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
