Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and `n-1` if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0 and then `n-1`, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the loop has finished executing, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The value of `n` remains unchanged, `arr` contains a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<', or two elements 0 and `n-1` if `res` is '=', or a single element 0 and then `n-1` otherwise. The value of `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`. The value of `res` is either '<' or not '<'. The value of `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged. The value of `i` is `n-1`. The current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin.
