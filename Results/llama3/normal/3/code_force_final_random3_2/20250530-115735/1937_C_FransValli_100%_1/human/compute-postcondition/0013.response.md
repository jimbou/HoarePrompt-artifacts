Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `maxi` is 2, `i` is 2, `res` is a string, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` is '<', then the string '?' along with the value of `maxi` which is 2, the value of `maxi` again which is 2, the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `i` again which is 2, is printed, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to 2, which is the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The printed output remains the same, but the conditional statement regarding `res` is still applicable.
