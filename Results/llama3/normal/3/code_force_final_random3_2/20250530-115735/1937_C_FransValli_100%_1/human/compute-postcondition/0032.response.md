Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `i` is 1. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, and `res` is a string containing '=' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 1. Otherwise, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, and `res` is a string containing '?' followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi`, followed by the value of `i` which is 1, and `res` is not equal to '<'.***
