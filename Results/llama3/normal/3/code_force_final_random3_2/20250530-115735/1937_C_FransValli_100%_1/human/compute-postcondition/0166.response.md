The code `maxi = i` assigns the value of `i` to `maxi`. In the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `maxi` is now 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. `n` is still an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` still has at least n-1 elements, `item` is still the last element of `arr`, `res` is still '<', and `stdin` still contains no input. The printed output is still ? 0 0 1 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `maxi` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is '<', `stdin` contains no input, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1.**
