Based on the precondition, let's analyze the variables and objects involved in the print statement:

* `maxi`: This variable is either `n-1` or unchanged. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `maxi` will be at least 2.
* `arr`: This list contains either a single element 1 (if `res` is '<'), two elements 0 and 1 (if `res` is '='), or a single element 0 (if `res` is not '<' or '='). Since `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, we can infer that `arr` has at least two elements.
* `i`: This variable is 2.

Now, let's examine the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`

The output will be a string that starts with '?' followed by the values of `maxi`, `arr[0]`, `maxi`, and `i`.

Since `arr` has at least two elements, `arr[0]` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `res`.

The output will be in the format: `? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] [i]`

Here, `[maxi]` will be at least 2, `[arr[0]]` will be either 0 or 1, and `[i]` will be 2.

Output: **? [at least 2] [0 or 1] [at least 2] 2**
