The code prints a string that starts with '?' and is followed by the value of `mini` twice, the value of `item` twice, and then the values of `maxi` and `i` twice, respectively.
Since `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, `item` is the second element of `arr`, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, and `i` is `n-1`, the print statement will output the string '?' followed by the values of `mini`, `item`, `maxi`, and `i` as described.
Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i] (where mini is either 0 or n-1, item is the second element of arr, maxi is either n-1 or unchanged, and i is n-1)**
