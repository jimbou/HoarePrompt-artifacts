Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is either `n-1` or unchanged, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i].**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been changed to a list containing a single element 0. The value of `item` is no longer the last element of `arr` because `arr` has been reassigned. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
