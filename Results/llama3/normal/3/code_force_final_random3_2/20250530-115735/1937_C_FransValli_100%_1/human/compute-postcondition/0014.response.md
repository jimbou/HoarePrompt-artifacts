Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `res` is a string, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2, otherwise `maxi` is either 0 or 1, and the string '?' along with the value of `maxi` (either 0, 1 or 2), the value of `maxi` again (either 0, 1 or 2), the value of `i` which is 2, and the value of `i` again which is 2, is printed, stdin is empty***
