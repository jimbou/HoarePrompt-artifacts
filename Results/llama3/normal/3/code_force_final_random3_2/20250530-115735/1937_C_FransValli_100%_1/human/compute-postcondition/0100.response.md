The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `maxi`, the value of `maxi` again, the value of `i`, and the value of `i` again. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is displayed immediately.

The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1. Otherwise, `maxi` is 2.

The value of `i` is given as 3.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing a question mark, the value of `maxi` (either 1 or 2), the value of `maxi` again, the value of `i` (which is 3), and the value of `i` again.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3 (where maxi is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of res)**
