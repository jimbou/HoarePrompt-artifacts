Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `res` is either '<' or '>' or '=' or '?' or '!' or ' ' or any other character, `maxi` is 3, stdin is empty, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and this is printed: '?' along with the value of `maxi` which is 3, the value of `maxi` again which is 3, the value of `i` which is 3, and the value of `i` again which is 3.**

Explanation: The code `maxi = i` assigns the value of `i` to `maxi`. Since `i` is 3, `maxi` is now 3. The other variables and the printed values remain unchanged.
