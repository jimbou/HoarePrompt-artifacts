Functionality: **This function accepts an integer input from the user, representing the number of iterations. For each iteration, it finds the maximum and minimum values within a range of numbers (from 1 to the current iteration number) by querying the user through a series of comparison questions. After determining the maximum and minimum values, it prints the result in the format '! [maxi] [mini]'. The function repeats this process until the initial input integer is reached, providing the maximum and minimum values for each iteration.**
