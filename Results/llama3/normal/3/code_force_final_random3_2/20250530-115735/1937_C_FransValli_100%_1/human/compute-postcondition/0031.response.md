Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, `i` is 1, `res` is a string containing '=' followed by the value of `maxi` which is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), followed by the first element of the list `arr` which is 0, followed by the value of `maxi` which is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), followed by the value of `i` which is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `arr` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `res` still contains the initial value '=' followed by the value of `maxi`, the first element of the list `arr`, the value of `maxi`, and the value of `i`.
