Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and `n-1` if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0 and then `n-1`, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element of `arr`, `res` is a string, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `mini` is either 0 or `n-1`, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is equal to `item`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is an input from the user, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`. The current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is equal to `item`, and this is printed: ? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]. Otherwise, the output remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least `n`, `arr` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, `res` is a string that is an input from the user, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is `n-1`. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the fourth element of `arr`, and this is printed: '?' followed by the value of the fourth element of `arr` twice, followed by the value of the fourth element of `arr` twice, stdin contains no input. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
