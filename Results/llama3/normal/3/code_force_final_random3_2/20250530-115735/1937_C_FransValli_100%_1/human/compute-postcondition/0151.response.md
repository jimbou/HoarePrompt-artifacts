The code prints a string containing a question mark, the value of `mini`, the value of `mini` again, the value of `item`, and the value of `item` again. The value of `mini` is either the third element of `arr` or the second element of `arr`, depending on whether `res` is '>' or not. The value of `item` is the fourth element of `arr`. The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is displayed immediately.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item] (where mini is either the 3rd element of arr or the 2nd element of arr, and item is the 4th element of arr)**
