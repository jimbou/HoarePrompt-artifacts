Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least n, arr has at least n-1 elements, item is the last element of arr, res is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input, maxi is either n-1 or unchanged, i is either n-1 or unchanged, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the integer `n` must be at least `n`, the array `arr` has at least `n-1` elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', and `stdin` contains no input. The value of `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, and the value of `i` is either `n-1` or unchanged. The current output is a string of '?' followed by the values of `maxi` and `i` repeated four times.
