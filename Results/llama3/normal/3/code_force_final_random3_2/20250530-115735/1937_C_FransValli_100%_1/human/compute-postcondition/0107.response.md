The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `res` is a string (the new input from stdin), `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `res` is either '<' or not '<', and `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1 and the printed values are '?' , [1], [1], [1], [1]. Otherwise, if `maxi` is `k`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and `n-1`, the printed values are '?' , [k], [k], [k], [k]**
