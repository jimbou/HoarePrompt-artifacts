Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 1, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned. The current value of `res` is '='**

The value of `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `arr` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
