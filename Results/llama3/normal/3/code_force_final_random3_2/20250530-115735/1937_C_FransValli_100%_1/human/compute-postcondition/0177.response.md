Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is the input string, `maxi` is either 1 or 2, `i` is either 3 or unchanged, and the current output is either ? 0 0 1 1 [2] [2] [2] [2] or ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to the input string. The values of `maxi` and `i` are either unchanged or updated based on the previous value of `res`. The current output and the printed output are also updated accordingly. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to accept the input string.
