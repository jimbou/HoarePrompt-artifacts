Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input, `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is either `n-1` or unchanged, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '<':
        arr = [i]
    elif res == '=':
        arr.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 1, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list containing a single element 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 2, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `arr` is a list containing a single element 3 if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 2 if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2 and then 3, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 3, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
