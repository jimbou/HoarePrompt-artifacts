Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `arr` is a list containing a single element 2 if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2 and then 3, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 3, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned, and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is at least 4. The list `arr` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `i`, which is 3. The value of `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`. The value of `res` remains either '<' or not '<'. The value of `maxi` remains either `n-1` or unchanged. The value of `i` remains 3. The current output and printed values remain the same. The stdin remains empty. The value of `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned again. The value of `res` is assigned the value of the input from stdin, but since stdin is empty, this assignment does not change the value of `res`.
