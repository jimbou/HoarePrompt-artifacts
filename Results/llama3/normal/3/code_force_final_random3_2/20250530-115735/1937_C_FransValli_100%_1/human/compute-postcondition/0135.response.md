Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', if `res` is '<', then `mini` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1` if `res` is '<', a single element `n-2` if `res` is '<' or a single element `n-3` if `res` is '>', and two elements 0 and `n-2` if `res` is '=', `maxi` is 1 if `res` is '<' or '>', and either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1` if `res` is '='. The following is printed: '?' , [maxi], [arr[0]], [maxi], [i]. If `res` is '=', the list `arr` now contains an additional element `i` which is `n-1`. Otherwise, the list `arr` remains unchanged.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` is now `n`.
- The value of `res` can be '<', '=', or '>'.
- If `res` is '<', then `mini` can be any value between 0 and `n-1`, `arr` contains a single element `n-1`, and `maxi` is 1.
- If `res` is '=', then `mini` can be any value between 0 and `n-1`, `arr` contains two elements 0 and `n-2`, and `maxi` can be any value between 1 and `n-1`.
- If `res` is '>', then `mini` can be any value between 0 and `n-1`, `arr` contains a single element `n-2`, and `maxi` is 1.
- The list `arr` is updated based on the value of `res`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` contains an additional element `i` which is `n-1`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.
