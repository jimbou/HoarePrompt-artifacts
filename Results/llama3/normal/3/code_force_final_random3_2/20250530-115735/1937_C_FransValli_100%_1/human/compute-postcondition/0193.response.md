The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 2, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned.**
