Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', `stdin` contains no input, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1, and `res` has been assigned the value from the input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state, except that `res` has been assigned a value from the input. Since `stdin` contains no input, the value of `res` is not specified, but it is either '>' or not '>'.
