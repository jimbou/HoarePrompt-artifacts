Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `item` is the third element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the third element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`.***
