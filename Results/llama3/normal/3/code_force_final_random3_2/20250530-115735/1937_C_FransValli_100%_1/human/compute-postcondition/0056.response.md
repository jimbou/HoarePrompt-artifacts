The code prints a string containing a question mark '?', the value of `mini` repeated twice, and the value of `item` repeated twice. The `flush=True` argument is used to force the output buffer to be flushed, but it does not affect the output itself.

Since `mini` is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), and `item` is an element of the list `arr` which can contain a single element `n-1`, or a list containing two elements `n-1` and `n-1`, or a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2, or a single element 3, or a single element 4, or a single element 5, or a single element 6, or a single element 7, or a single element 8, or a single element 9, or a single element 10, or a single element 11, or a single element 12, or a single element 13, or a single element 14, or a single element 15, or a single element 16, or a single element 17, or a single element 18, or a single element 19, or a single element 20, or a single element 21, or a single element 22, or a single element 23, or a single element 24, or a single element 25, or a single element 26, or a single element 27, or a single element 28, or a single element 29, or a single element 30, or a single element 31, or a single element 32, or a single element 33, or a single element 34, or a single element 35, or a single element 36, or a single element 37, or a single element 38, or a single element 39, or a single element 40, or a single element 41, or a single element 42, or a single element 43, or a single element 44, or a single element 45, or a single element 46, or a single element 47, or a single element 48, or a single element 49, or a single element 50, the output will be a string containing a question mark '?', the value of `mini` repeated twice, and the value of `item` repeated twice.

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]**
