Based on the initial state, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that will be printed.

* `maxi` is an integer between 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can't determine the exact value of `maxi`. However, we can describe it as an integer between 0 and `n-1`.
* `arr` is a list containing either a single element 1, two elements 0 and 1, or a single element 0, or a single element 2. Since we don't know the exact contents of the list, we can't determine the exact value of `arr[0]`. However, we can describe it as the first element of the list `arr`, which can be 0, 1, or 2.
* `i` is 3, which is a constant value.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)`

The print statement will output a string containing the following elements:

* '?' (a literal string)
* `maxi` (an integer between 0 and `n-1`)
* `arr[0]` (the first element of the list `arr`, which can be 0, 1, or 2)
* `maxi` (again, an integer between 0 and `n-1`)
* `i` (the constant value 3)

Since we can't determine the exact values of `maxi` and `arr[0]`, we can't provide a precise numerical output. However, we can describe the output as:

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 3 (where maxi is an integer between 0 and n-1, and arr[0] is the first element of the list arr, which can be 0, 1, or 2)**
