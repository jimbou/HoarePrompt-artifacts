Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `res` is either '<', '=', or '>', if `res` is '<', then `mini` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-1`, and `maxi` is 1, if `res` is '=', then `mini` is 0, `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and `n-2`, and `maxi` is either 1, 2, 3, ..., `n-1`, if `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list containing a single element `n-2`, and `maxi` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` is now `n`.
- The value of `res` can be '<', '=', or '>'.
- If `res` is '<', then `mini` is `n-1`, `arr` contains a single element `n-1`, and `maxi` is 1.
- If `res` is '=', then `mini` is 0, `arr` contains two elements 0 and `n-2`, and `maxi` can be any value between 1 and `n-1`.
- If `res` is '>', then `mini` is `n-2`, `arr` contains a single element `n-2`, and `maxi` is 1.
- The list `arr` is updated based on the value of `res`. If `res` is '=', then `arr` contains an additional element `i` which is `n-1`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.
