Output: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr` has at least `n-1` elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', stdin contains no input. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is the last element of `arr`. Otherwise, `mini` is the second element of `arr`, and this is printed: '!', the value of `maxi` and the value of `mini` which is either the last element of `arr` or the second element of `arr` depending on the value of `res`**
