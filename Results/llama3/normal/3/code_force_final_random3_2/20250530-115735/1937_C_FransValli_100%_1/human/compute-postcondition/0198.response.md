Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list containing a single element 1 if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is a list containing two elements 0 and 1 if `res` is '=', otherwise `arr` is a list containing a single element 0 and then 2, `item` is no longer the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '<' or not '<', `maxi` is either `n-1` or unchanged, `i` is 2, and the current output is ? 0 0 1 1 [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], and this is printed: ? [maxi] [0] [maxi] [i], stdin contains no input, and `res` is returned, and the value of `res` is returned.**

In this output state, the list `arr` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state still reflects the initial conditions, with `n` being at least 3, `res` being either '<' or not '<', and `maxi` being either `n-1` or unchanged. The current output and printed values also remain the same.
