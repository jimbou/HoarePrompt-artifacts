Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `maxi` is 0, `stdin` contains one input: a string, `i` is 1, `res` is a string, and this is printed: ? 0 0 1 1**

In this output state, the value of `res` is assigned the input string from `stdin`, which now contains one input: a string. The values of the other variables (`n`, `maxi`, `i`) remain unchanged. The print statement remains the same, printing: ? 0 0 1 1.
