To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


*   The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.
*   The variable `i` is not defined before the loop, but it will be defined within the loop. For the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 1.


Based on this analysis, the adjusted state is:


State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `arr` has at least n-1 elements, `item` is the last element of `arr`, `res` is either '>' or not '>', `stdin` contains no input**
