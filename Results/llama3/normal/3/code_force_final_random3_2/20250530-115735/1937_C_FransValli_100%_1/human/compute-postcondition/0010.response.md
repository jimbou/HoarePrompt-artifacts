Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables and objects that are printed.

The print statement is: `print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)`

Here's a breakdown of the values:

* `?`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
* `maxi`: This variable is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1, otherwise `maxi` remains 0. Since we don't know the exact value of `res`, we can't determine the exact value of `maxi`. However, we can describe it as "either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `res`".
* `i`: This variable is an integer with a value of 2.

Now, let's combine these values to describe the output:

Output: **? [either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `res`], [either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `res`], 2, 2**
