Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[i][j]` updated for all `i` and `j`, `dp[n - 5][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 4][j]`, `dp[n - 3][j - 1]` + 1, and `dp[n - 4][j + 1]`, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` + 1, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, specifically for `i` equal to `n` - 5. The other variables remain unchanged.
