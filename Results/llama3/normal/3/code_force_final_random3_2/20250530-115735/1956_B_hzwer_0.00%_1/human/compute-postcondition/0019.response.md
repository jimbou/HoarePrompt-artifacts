Output State: **n is at least 1, j is n - 3, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[n - 1][0] = 0, dp[n - 2][0] = 0, dp[n - 3][n - 2] = dp[n - 2][n - 2], i is n - 3, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n is still at least 1, the value of j is still n - 3, the list of cards remains the same with n integers, the 2D list dp remains the same with size (n + 1) x (n + 1) but the value of dp[n - 3][n - 2] has been updated to dp[n - 2][n - 2], the value of i is still n - 3, and there are (t - 1) test cases remaining in the stdin.
