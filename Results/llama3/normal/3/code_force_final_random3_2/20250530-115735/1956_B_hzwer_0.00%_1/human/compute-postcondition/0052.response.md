The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Since `i` is `n` - 5, we can substitute this value into the code to get `dp[n - 5][j] = dp[n - 4][j]`.

The initial state tells us that `dp[i][j]` is updated for all `i` and `j`, so we know that `dp[n - 4][j]` has a value. However, we don't know what that value is.

The other variables are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 4, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[n - 5][j]` updated to be equal to `dp[n - 4][j]`, `dp[i][j]` is updated for all `i` and `j` except `i` is not equal to `n` - 5, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5. The current value of `j + 1` does not exist in the list `cards`.**
