Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[n - 1][0] = 0 and dp[n - 2][0] = 0, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
        elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 1, j is 0, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[n - 1][0] = 0 and dp[n - 2][0] = 0, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, i is n - 3. dp[i][j] is set to dp[i + 1][j] if j + 1 does not appear in cards. If j + 1 appears in cards exactly once, then dp[i][j] is set to the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1. If j + 1 appears in cards more than once, then dp[i][j] is set to the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 1, j is -1, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[i][j] updated for all i and j, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, and i is n - 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 1, j is -1, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[i][j] updated for all i and j, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, and i is n - 5. dp[i][j] is updated based on the count of j + 1 in cards. If j + 1 does not exist in cards, then dp[i][j] is updated to dp[i + 1][j]. If j + 1 exists in cards, then if cards contains exactly one occurrence of j + 1, dp[i][j] is updated to the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] plus 1. If cards contains more than one occurrence of j + 1, then dp[i][j] is updated to be the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
