This function calculates the maximum possible score that can be obtained from a list of cards, considering different possible moves such as skipping a card, playing a card, or playing a pair of cards. It takes no explicit parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting multiple test cases where each test case consists of a number of cards and the card values. The function returns the maximum possible score for each test case.
