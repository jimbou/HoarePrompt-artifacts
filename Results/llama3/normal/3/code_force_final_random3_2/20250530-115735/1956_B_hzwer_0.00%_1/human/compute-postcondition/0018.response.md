The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be `n - 3`. Also, `i` is `n - 3`, so `i` is equal to `j`. 
State: **n is at least 1, j is n - 3, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[n - 1][0] = 0, dp[n - 2][0] = 0. If j + 1 does not appear in cards, then dp[n - 3][n - 2] = dp[n - 2][n - 2]. If j + 1 appears in cards, then dp[n - 3][n - 2] is set to the maximum of dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1, and dp[n - 2][n - 1] if j + 1 appears more than once in cards. Otherwise, dp[n - 3][n - 2] is set to the maximum of dp[n - 2][n - 2] and dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1. stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, and i is n - 3**
