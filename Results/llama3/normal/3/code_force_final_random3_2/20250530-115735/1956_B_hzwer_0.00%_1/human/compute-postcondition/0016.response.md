Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, j is n - 2, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[n - 1][0] = 0, dp[n - 2][0] = 0, and dp[n - 3][n - 2] is set to the maximum of dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1, and dp[n - 2][n - 1] if j + 1 appears more than once in cards. Otherwise, dp[n - 3][n - 2] is set to the maximum of dp[n - 2][n - 2] and dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1. stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, and i is n - 3.***
