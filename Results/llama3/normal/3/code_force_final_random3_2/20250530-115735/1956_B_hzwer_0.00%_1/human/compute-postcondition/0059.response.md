Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 4, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[i][j]` updated for all `i` and `j`, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5. If `j + 1` does not exist in `cards`, then `dp[n - 5][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[n - 4][j]`. If `j + 1` exists in `cards`, then if `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` plus 1. If `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` + 1, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.***
