Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 3][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is updated, `dp[n - 4][n - 2]` is updated to `max(dp[n - 3][n - 2], dp[n - 2][n - 3] + 1)`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, and `i` is `n - 4`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains at least 1, `j` remains `n - 2`, and `cards` remains a list of `n` integers. The 2D list `dp` is updated at position `[n - 4][n - 2]` with the maximum value between `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 2][n - 3] + 1`. The other values in `dp` remain the same, including `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 3][0] = 0`, and the updated `dp[n - 4][n - 1]`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `(t - 1)`, and `i` remains `n - 4`.
