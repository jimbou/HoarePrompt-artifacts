Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, `i` is `n - 3`, stdin contains `(t - 1)` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, which means it now holds the maximum value between these two options. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `(t - 1)` test cases.
