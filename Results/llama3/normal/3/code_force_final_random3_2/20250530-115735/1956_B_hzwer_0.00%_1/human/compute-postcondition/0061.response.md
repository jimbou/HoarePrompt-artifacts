Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[i][j]` updated to `dp[i + 1][j]` for `i` = `n` - 5, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[i][j]` for `i` = `n` - 5 has been updated to the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The 2D list `dp` has been modified at the position `[i][j]` where `i` is `n` - 5. The rest of the variables and the stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
