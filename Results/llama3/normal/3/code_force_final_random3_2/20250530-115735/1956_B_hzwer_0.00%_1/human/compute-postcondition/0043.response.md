Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 3][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 4][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is updated, `dp[n - 4][n - 3]` is updated to be equal to `dp[n - 3][n - 3]`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, and `i` is `n - 4`.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, which means `dp[n - 4][n - 3]` is now equal to `dp[n - 3][n - 3]`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
