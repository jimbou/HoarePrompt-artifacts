Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, j is n - 3, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[n - 3][0] = 0, dp[n - 4][0] = 0, dp[n - 4][n - 1] is updated, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, and i is n - 4. If cards does not contain j + 1, then dp[n - 4][n - 3] is updated to be equal to dp[n - 3][n - 3]. If cards contains exactly one occurrence of j + 1, then dp[n - 4][n - 3] is updated to max(dp[n - 3][n - 3], dp[n - 2][n - 4] + 1). If cards contains more than one occurrence of j + 1, then dp[n - 4][n - 3] is updated to max(dp[n - 3][n - 3], dp[n - 2][n - 4] + 1, dp[n - 3][n - 2]).***
