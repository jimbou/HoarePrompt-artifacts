Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[i][j]` updated for all `i` and `j`, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `i` is `n` - 5, and `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated based on the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains (`t` - 1) test cases.
