You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), the number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n), the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: n is at least 1, j is -1, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[i][j] updated for all i and j, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, and i is -1. dp[i][j] is updated based on the count of j + 1 in cards. If j + 1 does not exist in cards, then dp[i][j] is updated to dp[i + 1][j]. If j + 1 exists in cards, then if cards contains exactly one occurrence of j + 1, dp[i][j] is updated to the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] plus 1. If cards contains more than one occurrence of j + 1, then dp[i][j] is updated to be the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum possible score that can be obtained from the list of cards, considering the dynamic programming table dp has been updated based on the count of each card value in the list, and the score is calculated by considering the maximum of different possible moves, including skipping a card, playing a card, or playing a pair of cards.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum possible score that can be obtained from the list of cards, considering the dynamic programming table dp has been updated based on the count of each card value in the list, and the score is calculated by considering the maximum of different possible moves, including skipping a card, playing a card, or playing a pair of cards.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
