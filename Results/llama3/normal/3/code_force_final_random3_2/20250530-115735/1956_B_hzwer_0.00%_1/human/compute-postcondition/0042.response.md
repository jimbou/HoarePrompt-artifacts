The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` is `n - 3`.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 3][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 4][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is updated, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, and `i` is `n - 4`.**
