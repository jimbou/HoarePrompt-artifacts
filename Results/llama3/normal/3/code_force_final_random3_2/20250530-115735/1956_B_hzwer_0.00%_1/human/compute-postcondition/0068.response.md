Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) where `dp[n - 5][2]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][2]` and `dp[n - 3][1]` + 1, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp` at position `[n - 5][2]` has been updated to be the maximum of the value at position `[n - 4][2]` and the value at position `[n - 3][1]` plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
