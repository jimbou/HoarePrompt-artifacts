To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 and `j` is within the range from `n - 1` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

Given that `n` is already at least 1, we can focus on adjusting `j`. Since `j` needs to be within the specified range, we can set `j` to be `n - 1` to ensure the loop executes.

The other variables (`cards`, `dp`, `stdin`, and `i`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0` and `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 4`**
