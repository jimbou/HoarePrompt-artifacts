The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `j` must be 2.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1), `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5**
