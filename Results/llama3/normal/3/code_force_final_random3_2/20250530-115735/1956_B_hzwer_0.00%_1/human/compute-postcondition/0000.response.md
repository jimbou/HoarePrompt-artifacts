Output State: **n is an integer, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[n - 1][0] = 0 and dp[n - 2][0] = 0, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin and assigns them to `cards`. The third line creates a 2D list `dp` of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0. The fourth and fifth lines assign 0 to `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]`, respectively. 

Since `n` is an integer and `cards` is a list of `n` integers, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, the final state includes these variables with their respective values. The value of `n` is an integer, and the value of `cards` is a list of `n` integers. The value of `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` equal to 0. 

Also, since the first line of stdin contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two lines, after reading the first test case, stdin contains `(t - 1)` test cases.
