To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that `j` is the variable being iterated, and its value decreases by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. To execute the loop again, `j` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` is `n - 2`.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `cards`, `dp`, `stdin`, `i`, and `t`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0` and `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 3`**
