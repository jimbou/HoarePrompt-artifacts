Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still equal to `n` - 5, and `j` is still equal to 2.
