To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 and `j` is within the range of `n - 1` to `-1` (inclusive). Since `n` is already at least 1, we can focus on adjusting `j`.

For the loop to execute, `j` should be at least `n - 1`. Since `i` is `n - 5`, we can infer that `n` is at least 5. Therefore, `j` should be at least 4.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 4, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[i][j]` updated for all `i` and `j`, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5**
