The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`. The value of `i` is `n` - 5, and `j` is 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains (`t` - 1) test cases. The size of `dp` is (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1). The value of `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]` which is `dp[(n - 5) + 1][2]` which is `dp[n - 4][2]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) where `dp[n - 5][2]` is `dp[n - 4][2]`, `i` is `n` - 5, and stdin contains (`t` - 1) test cases.**
