Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n + 1`) x (`n + 1`) with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 1]` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, otherwise `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, `i` is `n - 3`, stdin contains (`t - 1`) test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is specifically updated based on whether `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`. The rest of the state remains the same as the initial state.
