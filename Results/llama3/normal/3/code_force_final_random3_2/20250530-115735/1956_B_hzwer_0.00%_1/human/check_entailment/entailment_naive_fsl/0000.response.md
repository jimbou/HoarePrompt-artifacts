Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem described, and it correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

The program initializes a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (n+1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player if they have `i` cards left and the opponent has `j` cards left.

The program then fills up the `dp` array in a bottom-up manner, starting from the base cases where `i` is `n-1` or `n-2`. For each cell `dp[i][j]`, it considers three cases:

1. If the current card is not present in the player's hand, it simply copies the value from the cell `dp[i+1][j]`.
2. If the current card is present in the player's hand only once, it considers two options: either play the card and score a point, or don't play the card and move to the next cell `dp[i+1][j]`. It chooses the maximum of these two options.
3. If the current card is present in the player's hand twice, it considers three options: either play one of the cards and score a point, or play both cards and score two points, or don't play either card and move to the next cell `dp[i+1][j]`. It chooses the maximum of these three options.

Finally, the program returns the value of `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player if they play optimally.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach and considers all possible cases, making it correct for all potential inputs.
