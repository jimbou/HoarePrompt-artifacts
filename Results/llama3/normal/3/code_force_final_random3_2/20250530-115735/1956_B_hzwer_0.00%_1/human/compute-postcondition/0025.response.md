The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - 4`.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0` and `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 4`**
