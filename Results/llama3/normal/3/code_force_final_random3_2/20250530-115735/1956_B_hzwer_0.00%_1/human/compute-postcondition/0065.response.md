Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1), `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5. If `cards` does not contain `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[n - 5][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 4][j]`, `dp[n - 3][j - 1]` + 1, and `dp[n - 4][j + 1]`.***
