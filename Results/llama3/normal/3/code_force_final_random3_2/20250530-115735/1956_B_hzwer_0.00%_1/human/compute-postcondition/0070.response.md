Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1), `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, then `dp[n - 5][2]` is the maximum of `dp[n - 4][2]` and `dp[n - 3][1]` + 1. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.***
