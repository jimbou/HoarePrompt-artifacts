To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 4. To execute the loop again, `j` must be decremented by 1, since the loop iterates in reverse order.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 3, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[i][j]` updated for all `i` and `j`, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5.**

Note that the states of `cards`, `dp`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head. Only the state of `j` is adjusted to reflect the decrement by 1.
