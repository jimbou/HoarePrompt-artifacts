Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1] = max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 3`. The number `j + 1` is present in the list `cards` exactly once.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, where `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The 2D list `dp` now has an additional value at position `[n - 3][n - 1]`, which is the maximum of the two values calculated. The rest of the preconditions remain valid, including the presence of the number `j + 1` in the list `cards` exactly once.
