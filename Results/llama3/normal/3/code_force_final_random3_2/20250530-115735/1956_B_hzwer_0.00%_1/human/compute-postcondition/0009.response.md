Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 3][n - 1] = max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1, dp[n - 2][n])`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 3`. The number `j + 1` is present in the list `cards` more than once.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `i` is still `n - 3`, and `j` is still `n - 1`. The number `j + 1` is still present in the list `cards` more than once.
