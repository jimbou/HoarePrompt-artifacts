The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 4`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - 5`. Since `n` is at least 1, `n - 5` is at least -4.
State: **n is at least 1, j is -1, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[i][j] updated for all i and j, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, and i is n - 5**
