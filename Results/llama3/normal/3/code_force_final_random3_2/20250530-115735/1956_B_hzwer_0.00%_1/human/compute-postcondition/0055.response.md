Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 4, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[i][j]` updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` plus 1 for `i` equals `n` - 5, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5. The list `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` plus 1, specifically for `i` equals `n` - 5. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
