Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, and `dp[n - 4][n - 1] = dp[n - 3][n - 1]`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 4`. The current value of `j + 1` is not present in the list `cards`.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`, where `i` is `n - 4` and `j` is `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is now equal to `dp[n - 3][n - 1]`.
