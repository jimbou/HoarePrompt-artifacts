Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 4, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (`n` + 1) x (`n` + 1) with `dp[i][j]` updated to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` + 1, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, `stdin` contains (`t` - 1) test cases, and `i` is `n` - 5. The list `cards` contains more than one occurrence of `j + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of three possible values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1]` + 1, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. This update is based on the values of `dp` that were already updated for all `i` and `j`. The other variables, including `n`, `j`, `cards`, `stdin`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
