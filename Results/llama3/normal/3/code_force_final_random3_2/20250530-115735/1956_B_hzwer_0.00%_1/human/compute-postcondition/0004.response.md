Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers and does not contain `j + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, and `dp[n - 3][n - 1] = dp[n - 2][n - 1]`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 3`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 1, `j` is still `n - 1`, and the list `cards` still contains `n` integers and does not contain `j + 1`. The 2D list `dp` still has a size of `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, and its values at indices `[n - 1][0]` and `[n - 2][0]` are still 0. Additionally, the value of `dp` at index `[n - 3][n - 1]` is now equal to the value of `dp` at index `[n - 2][n - 1]`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `(t - 1)`, and the value of `i` is still `n - 3`.
