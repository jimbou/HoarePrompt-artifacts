#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), the number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n), the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: n is at least 1, j is -1, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with dp[i][j] updated for all i and j, stdin contains (t - 1) test cases, and i is -1. dp[i][j] is updated based on the count of j + 1 in cards. If j + 1 does not exist in cards, then dp[i][j] is updated to dp[i + 1][j]. If j + 1 exists in cards, then if cards contains exactly one occurrence of j + 1, dp[i][j] is updated to the maximum of dp[i + 1][j] and dp[i + 2][j - 1] plus 1. If cards contains more than one occurrence of j + 1, then dp[i][j] is updated to be the maximum of dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, and dp[i + 1][j + 1].
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum possible score that can be obtained from the list of cards, considering the dynamic programming table dp has been updated based on the count of each card value in the list, and the score is calculated by considering the maximum of different possible moves, including skipping a card, playing a card, or playing a pair of cards.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum possible score that can be obtained from a list of cards, considering different possible moves such as skipping a card, playing a card, or playing a pair of cards. It takes no explicit parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting multiple test cases where each test case consists of a number of cards and the card values. The function returns the maximum possible score for each test case.
