Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, and `dp[n - 3][n - 2] = max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1, dp[n - 2][n - 1])`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 3`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 1, `j` is still `n - 2`, and `cards` is still a list of `n` integers. The 2D list `dp` has been updated with a new value at position `[n - 3][n - 2]`, which is the maximum of the values at positions `[n - 2][n - 2]`, `[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, and `[n - 2][n - 1]`. The values of `dp` at positions `[n - 1][0]` and `[n - 2][0]` are still 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `(t - 1)`, and the value of `i` is still `n - 3`.
