Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `cards` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with `dp[n - 1][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 2][0] = 0`, `dp[n - 3][n - 2] = max(dp[n - 2][n - 2], dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1)`, `stdin` contains `(t - 1)` test cases, `i` is `n - 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, where `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 2`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
