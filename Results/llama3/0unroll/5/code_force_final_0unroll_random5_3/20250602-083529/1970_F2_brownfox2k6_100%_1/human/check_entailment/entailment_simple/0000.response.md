Reasoning: 

The given program appears to be a correct implementation of the Quidditch game simulation. It correctly initializes the game state, processes the actions of the players and the Bludger, and updates the game state accordingly. The program also correctly handles the scoring and elimination of players.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to update the positions of the objects on the field and to check for collisions between the Bludger and the players, respectively. The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of an object based on the direction of movement, and the `func_2` function correctly checks for collisions and eliminates players if necessary.

The program also correctly handles the scoring of goals and the printing of the final score. It checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly, and it prints the final score at the end of the game.

Overall, the program appears to be a correct implementation of the Quidditch game simulation.

Correctness: **True**
