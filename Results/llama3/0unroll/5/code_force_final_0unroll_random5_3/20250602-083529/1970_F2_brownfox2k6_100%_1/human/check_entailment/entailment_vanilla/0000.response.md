Reasoning:

The provided program is a Python script that appears to be a solution to the Quidditch game simulation problem. The script defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes an object `obj` and a direction `d` as input. It updates the position of the object based on the direction. The direction can be one of 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', which correspond to moving up, down, left, or right, respectively.

`func_2` takes a time `t` as input and checks if any player is at the same position as the Bludger. If a player is found, it prints an "ELIMINATED" message with the player's name and updates the player's position to [-1, -1].

The script also defines a `player` dictionary that stores the positions of the players and a `blud` variable that stores the position of the Bludger.

The script reads the input from the user, which includes the size of the field, the initial positions of the players and the Bludger, and the actions to be performed.

The script then simulates the game by iterating over the actions and updating the positions of the players and the Bludger accordingly. If a player is eliminated, it calls `func_2` to print the "ELIMINATED" message.

The script also checks if a player scores a goal and updates the score accordingly.

Finally, the script prints the final score.

Correctness: **True**

The script appears to be a correct solution to the Quidditch game simulation problem. It correctly updates the positions of the players and the Bludger based on the actions, checks for eliminations and goal scoring, and prints the final score. The script also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when a player is eliminated or scores a goal.
