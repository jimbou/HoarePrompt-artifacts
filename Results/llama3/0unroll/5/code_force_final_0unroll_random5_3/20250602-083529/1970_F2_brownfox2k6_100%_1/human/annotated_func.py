#State of the program right berfore the function call: obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, and d is a string representing a direction (U, D, L, or R) indicating the direction of movement.
    if (d == 'U') :
        obj[0] -= 1
    else :
        if (d == 'D') :
            obj[0] += 1
        else :
            if (d == 'L') :
                obj[1] -= 1
            else :
                if (d == 'R') :
                    obj[1] += 1
                #State: *`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field. If the direction of movement `d` is 'R', the y-coordinate of `obj` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of `obj` and `d` remains unchanged.
            #State: *`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field. If the direction of movement `d` is 'L', the y-coordinate of `obj` is decreased by 1. If the direction of movement `d` is 'R', the y-coordinate of `obj` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of `obj` and `d` remains unchanged.
        #State: `obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field. If the direction of movement `d` is 'D', the x-coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1. If the direction of movement `d` is 'L', the y-coordinate of `obj` is decreased by 1. If the direction of movement `d` is 'R', the y-coordinate of `obj` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of `obj` and `d` remains unchanged.
    #State: The object's coordinates are updated based on the direction of movement. If the direction is 'U', the x-coordinate is decreased by 1. If the direction is 'D', the x-coordinate is increased by 1. If the direction is 'L', the y-coordinate is decreased by 1. If the direction is 'R', the y-coordinate is increased by 1. If the direction is none of the above, the object's coordinates and direction remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:Moves an object on a field in a specified direction, updating its coordinates accordingly. The function takes a list of two integers representing the object's current coordinates and a string indicating the direction of movement (U, D, L, or R). It then updates the object's coordinates based on the direction: moving up (U) decreases the x-coordinate by 1, moving down (D) increases the x-coordinate by 1, moving left (L) decreases the y-coordinate by 1, and moving right (R) increases the y-coordinate by 1. If the direction is not one of the above, the object's coordinates remain unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer representing the current time in the game, player is a dictionary where the keys are player identifiers (strings) and the values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field.
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time in the game, `player` is a dictionary where the keys are player identifiers (strings) and the values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is a list of player identifiers (strings) that were hit by the Bludger.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed output. The loop iterates over the sorted list of player identifiers in the `out` list and prints the current time `t`, the player identifier `p`, and the string `'ELIMINATED'`. The values of `t`, `player`, `blud`, and `out` remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:Identifies and eliminates players hit by the Bludger, printing the current time and the eliminated player's identifier, and updates the player's position to [-1, -1].
