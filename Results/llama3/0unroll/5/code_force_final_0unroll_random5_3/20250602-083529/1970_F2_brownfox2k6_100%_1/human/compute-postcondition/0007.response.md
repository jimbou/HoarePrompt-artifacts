Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, where the y-coordinate is decreased by 1, and `d` is 'L' indicating the direction of movement is to the left.**

In this output state, the value of `obj` has been updated such that its second element (the y-coordinate) is decreased by 1. The value of `d` remains unchanged, still indicating that the direction of movement is to the left.
