Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when a player scores in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in the wrong goal, the other team wins a point. However, the program does not check for this condition and does not update the score accordingly.

For example, if the input is:

3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T

The program will print "4 BLUE GOAL" and "FINAL SCORE: 0 1", but it should print "4 RED GOAL" and "FINAL SCORE: 1 0" because the red player scored in the blue goal, which means the red team wins a point.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle this specific case correctly.
