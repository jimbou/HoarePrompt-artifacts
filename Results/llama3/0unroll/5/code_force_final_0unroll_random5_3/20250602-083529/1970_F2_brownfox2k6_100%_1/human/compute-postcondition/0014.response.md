Postcondition: **The object's coordinates are updated based on the direction of movement. If the direction is 'U', the x-coordinate is decreased by 1. If the direction is 'D', the x-coordinate is increased by 1. If the direction is 'L', the y-coordinate is decreased by 1. If the direction is 'R', the y-coordinate is increased by 1. If the direction is none of the above, the object's coordinates and direction remain unchanged.**
