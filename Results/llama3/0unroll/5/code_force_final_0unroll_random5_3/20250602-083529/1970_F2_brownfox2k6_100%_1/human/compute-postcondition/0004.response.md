Output State: The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed output. The loop iterates over the sorted list of player identifiers in the `out` list and prints the current time `t`, the player identifier `p`, and the string `'ELIMINATED'`. The values of `t`, `player`, `blud`, and `out` remain unchanged.
