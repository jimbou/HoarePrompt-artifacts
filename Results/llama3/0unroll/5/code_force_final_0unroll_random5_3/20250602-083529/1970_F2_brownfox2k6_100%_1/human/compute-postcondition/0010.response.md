Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, where the y-coordinate is incremented by 1, and `d` is a string representing a direction, and the current value of `d` is 'R' indicating the direction of movement is to the right.**

In natural language, this means that the object's y-coordinate has moved one unit to the right, while its x-coordinate remains the same. The direction of movement, represented by the variable `d`, is still to the right, as indicated by the value 'R'.
