Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field. If the direction of movement `d` is 'L', the y-coordinate of `obj` is decreased by 1. If the direction of movement `d` is 'R', the y-coordinate of `obj` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of `obj` and `d` remains unchanged.***
