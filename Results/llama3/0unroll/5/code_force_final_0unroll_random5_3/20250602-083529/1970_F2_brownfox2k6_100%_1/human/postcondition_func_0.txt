Moves an object on a field in a specified direction, updating its coordinates accordingly. The function takes a list of two integers representing the object's current coordinates and a string indicating the direction of movement (U, D, L, or R). It then updates the object's coordinates based on the direction: moving up (U) decreases the x-coordinate by 1, moving down (D) increases the x-coordinate by 1, moving left (L) decreases the y-coordinate by 1, and moving right (R) increases the y-coordinate by 1. If the direction is not one of the above, the object's coordinates remain unchanged.
