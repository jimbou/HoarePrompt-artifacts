Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum possible penalty for a given string of '+' and '-' characters. The program splits the string into parts separated by '-' characters and calculates the total length of these parts. It then calls the function func_1 to calculate the minimum penalty.

The function func_1 iterates over the characters in the string, maintaining a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments a counter and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the counter value plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise 0.

The program's logic is correct because it effectively counts the number of times the balance becomes negative and the final balance status, which corresponds to the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function func_1 is called with the original expression and the result_length, but it does not use the result_length. Instead, it should be called with the parts of the expression separated by '-' characters, and the length of each part should be used to calculate the penalty.

Correctness: **False**
