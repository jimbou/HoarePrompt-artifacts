#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: Output State: The final balance is the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the expression, and the count is the number of times the balance went below 0 during the iteration.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the total of the number of times the balance went below 0 during the iteration and 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string expression consisting of '+' and '-' characters and its length as input, and returns the total number of times the balance went below 0 during the iteration plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise 0. The function effectively counts the number of times the balance becomes negative and the final balance status, providing a summary of the balance fluctuations in the given expression.
