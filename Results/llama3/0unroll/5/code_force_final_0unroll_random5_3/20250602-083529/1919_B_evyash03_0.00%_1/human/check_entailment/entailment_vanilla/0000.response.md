Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then splits the string into parts separated by '-' and calculates the total length of the parts.

The program then calls the function `func_1` with the string and the total length of the parts as arguments. This function calculates the minimum possible penalty by iterating over the string and keeping track of the balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments the count of penalties and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count of penalties plus 1 if the balance is positive at the end.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is not correctly calculating the minimum possible penalty. The correct approach would be to calculate the total number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then return the absolute difference between these two counts.

Correctness: **False**
