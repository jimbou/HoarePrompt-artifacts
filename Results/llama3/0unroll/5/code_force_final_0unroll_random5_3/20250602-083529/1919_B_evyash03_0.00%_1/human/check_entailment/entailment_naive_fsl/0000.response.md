Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty. The issue lies in the way it splits the array into subarrays. The program splits the array at every '-' character, but this is not the optimal way to split the array. The optimal way to split the array is to split it into subarrays that have a sum of 0, or as close to 0 as possible.

For example, consider the input '+-+-'. The program would split this into ['+', '-', '+', '-'], which would result in a penalty of 4. However, the optimal way to split this array is ['+-', '+-'], which would result in a penalty of 0.

The program does not take into account the fact that the optimal way to split the array may involve splitting it into subarrays that contain both '+' and '-' characters. It only splits the array at '-' characters, which is not sufficient to find the minimum possible penalty.
