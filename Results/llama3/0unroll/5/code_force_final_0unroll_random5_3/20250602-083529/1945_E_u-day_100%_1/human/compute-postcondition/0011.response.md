To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `low = pos`
2. `high = pos + 1`
3. `st` is a set of integers from 0 to `n-1` that are greater than `pos`.
4. `pos` remains the same.
5. `n` remains the same.
6. `k` remains the same.
7. `arr` remains the same.
8. The element at index `low` in `arr` is not equal to `k`.
9. 1 is printed (this seems to be an additional statement but is not directly relevant to the print statement in question).

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

From the initial state, we know that `low = pos`. Therefore, `low + 1` is equivalent to `pos + 1`.

Since `pos` remains the same, `pos + 1` will simply be the value of `pos` incremented by 1.

However, without knowing the explicit value of `pos`, we cannot provide a numerical value for `pos + 1`. But we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **pos + 1, pos + 1 (where pos is the unchanged value of pos)**
