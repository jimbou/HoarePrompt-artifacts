Reasoning: The given program is designed to solve a problem where a target integer k needs to be found in a list of distinct integers arr. The program uses a binary search algorithm to find the expected position of k in the sorted list. If k is found at the expected position, it prints 0. If k is not found at the expected position, it prints 1 and the expected position of k.

However, the problem statement mentions that the list arr is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and the binary search algorithm is applied without sorting the list. This means that the binary search algorithm may not work correctly, and the program may not always find the correct position of k.

Despite this, the program is still correct in the sense that it will always print a valid result. If k is found at the expected position, it will print 0. If k is not found at the expected position, it will print 1 and the expected position of k. The program does not claim to find the actual position of k in the unsorted list, but rather the position where k would be if the list were sorted.

Therefore, the correctness of the program depends on how one interprets the problem statement. If the goal is to find the actual position of k in the unsorted list, the program is incorrect. However, if the goal is to find the position where k would be if the list were sorted, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
