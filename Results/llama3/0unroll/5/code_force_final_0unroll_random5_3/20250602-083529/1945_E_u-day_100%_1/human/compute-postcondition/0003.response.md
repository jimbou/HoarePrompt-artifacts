Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, pos is the index of the element k in the list arr if k exists in arr, otherwise pos is -1, low is 0, high is n, st is an empty set**

The code initializes two new variables, `low` and `high`, and assigns them the values 0 and `n`, respectively. It also creates an empty set `st`. The existing variables `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties as specified in the initial state.
