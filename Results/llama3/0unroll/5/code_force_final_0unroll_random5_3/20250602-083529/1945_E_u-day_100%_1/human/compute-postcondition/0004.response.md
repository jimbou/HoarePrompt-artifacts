Output State: **low = pos, high = pos + 1, st = a set of integers from 0 to n-1 that are greater than pos, pos remains the same, n remains the same, k remains the same, arr remains the same.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable "low" will be equal to the index of the element "k" in the list "arr", and the variable "high" will be equal to the index of the element "k" plus one. The set "st" will contain all the integers from 0 to n-1 that are greater than the index of the element "k". The variables "pos", "n", "k", and "arr" remain unchanged.
