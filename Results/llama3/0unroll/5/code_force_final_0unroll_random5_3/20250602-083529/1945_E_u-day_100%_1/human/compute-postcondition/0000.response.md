Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, pos is -1**

The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns the returned tuple of two integers to `n` and `k`. Since `func_1()` returns a tuple of two integers, `n` and `k` are updated with new values. The second line calls the function `func_2()` and assigns the returned list of integers to `arr`. The third line initializes a new variable `pos` with the value `-1`. 

After executing the entire code block, the values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` are updated based on the return values of `func_1()` and `func_2()`. The variable `pos` is introduced with a value of `-1`. The initial state's constraints on `n` and `k` being positive integers and `arr` being a list of distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order are preserved.
