You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and the function func_1() returns a tuple of two integers (n, k), and the function func_2() returns a list of integers arr.
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, pos is the index of the element k in the list arr if k exists in arr, otherwise pos is -1.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low = pos, high = pos + 1, st = a set of integers from 0 to n-1 that are greater than pos, pos remains the same, n remains the same, k remains the same, arr remains the same.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: pos + 1, pos + 1 (where pos is the unchanged value of pos)
    #State: low equals pos, high equals pos + 1, st is a set of integers from 0 to n-1 that are greater than pos, pos remains the same, n remains the same, k remains the same, arr remains the same. If the current value of arr at index low is equal to k, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed and (pos + 1, pos + 2) is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: low equals pos, high equals pos + 1, st is a set of integers from 0 to n-1 that are greater than pos, pos remains the same, n remains the same, k remains the same, arr remains the same, and the current value of arr at index low is equal to k, and 0 is printed

Case_2: low = pos, high = pos + 1, st = a set of integers from 0 to n-1 that are greater than pos, pos remains the same, n remains the same, k remains the same, arr remains the same, and the element at index low in arr is not equal to k, and 1 is printed, and this is printed: (pos + 1, pos + 2)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
