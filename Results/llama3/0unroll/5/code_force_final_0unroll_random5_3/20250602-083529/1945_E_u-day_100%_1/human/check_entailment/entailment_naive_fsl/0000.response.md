Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem description. The algorithm states that if `p_m <= x`, then `l = m`, otherwise `r = m`. However, in the program, the condition is `if arr[mid] > k`, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `if arr[mid] <= k`.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where `arr[low] == k`. In this case, the program should print `0` and not perform any swaps, but the program prints `1` and performs a swap.

For example, if the input is `n = 5, k = 3` and the permutation is `[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`, the program will print `1` and perform a swap, but the correct output should be `0` because `arr[low] == k`.
