Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the position of the target number `k` in the permutation `arr`. The program first finds the position of `k` in `arr` and then uses binary search to find the correct position of `k` in the sorted permutation. If the correct position of `k` is not at the found position, the program swaps the elements at the found position and the correct position, and prints the number of operations performed (1 in this case) along with the indices of the swapped elements.

The program correctly handles the case where the correct position of `k` is already at the found position, in which case it prints 0, indicating that no operations were performed.

The program also correctly handles the case where the permutation `arr` is already sorted, in which case the binary search will find the correct position of `k` without needing to swap any elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
