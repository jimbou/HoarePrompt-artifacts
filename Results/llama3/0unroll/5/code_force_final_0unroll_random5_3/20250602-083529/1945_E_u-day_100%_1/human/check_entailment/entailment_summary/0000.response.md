Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where a binary search algorithm is applied to an unsorted permutation of integers. The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, the target integer `k` is found at the expected position.

The program consists of multiple functions, but the main logic is implemented in `func_3()`. This function reads the input, finds the position of the target integer `k` in the permutation, and then applies a binary search-like algorithm to find the expected position of `k`.

If `k` is found at the expected position, the function prints 0, indicating that no operations are needed. If `k` is not found at the expected position, the function prints 1 and the expected position of `k`, indicating that one operation is needed to swap the elements at the expected position and the actual position of `k`.

The program does not modify the input list or variables, and it only uses the input values to determine the output. The output is solely based on the input values and the logic implemented in the program.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
