Postcondition: **low equals pos, high equals pos + 1, st is a set of integers from 0 to n-1 that are greater than pos, pos remains the same, n remains the same, k remains the same, arr remains the same. If the current value of arr at index low is equal to k, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed and (pos + 1, pos + 2) is printed.**
