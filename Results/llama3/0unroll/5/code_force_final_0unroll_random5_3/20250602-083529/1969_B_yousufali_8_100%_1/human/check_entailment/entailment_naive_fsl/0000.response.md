Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input string is "101", the program will output 3, but the correct answer is 2. This is because the program is counting the number of 1's and adding 1 to the answer whenever it encounters a 0 after a 1, but this approach does not take into account the fact that a cyclic shift can be performed on a substring of length 2.

In the case of the input string "101", a cyclic shift can be performed on the substring "10" to get "01", which is sorted in non-descending order. Therefore, the minimum total cost to make the string sorted is 2, not 3.

The program does not handle this case correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
