Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1()` takes a binary string as input and returns the total number of '0's in the string that are preceded by at least one '1'. This is not directly related to the problem, as it does not consider the cost of operations or the sorting of the string.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer `t` from standard input, followed by `t` binary strings, and then executes a loop `t` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration. This function does not return any value or modify the input binary strings, leaving the standard input unchanged.

However, the problem statement requires finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted, which is not achieved by either `func_1()` or `func_2()`. The functions do not consider the cost of operations or the sorting of the string.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
