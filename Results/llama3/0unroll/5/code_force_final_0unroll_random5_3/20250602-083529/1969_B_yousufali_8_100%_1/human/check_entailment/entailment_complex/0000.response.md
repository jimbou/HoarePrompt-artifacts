Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 takes a binary string as input and calculates the total number of '0's that are preceded by at least one '1'. This is done by iterating through the string and incrementing a counter `n` whenever a '1' is encountered. When a '0' is encountered and `n` is not zero, it means that the '0' is preceded by at least one '1', so the counter `ans` is incremented by `n + 1`.

Function 2 reads an integer `t` from standard input, followed by `t` binary strings. It then executes a loop `t` times, calling Function 1 in each iteration.

The key insight here is that the minimum total cost to make the string sorted is equal to the total number of '0's that are preceded by at least one '1'. This is because each '0' that is preceded by a '1' needs to be shifted to the right of the '1' to make the string sorted, and the cost of this operation is equal to the number of '1's preceding the '0' plus one.

Therefore, Function 1 correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the string sorted, and Function 2 correctly reads the input and calls Function 1 for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
