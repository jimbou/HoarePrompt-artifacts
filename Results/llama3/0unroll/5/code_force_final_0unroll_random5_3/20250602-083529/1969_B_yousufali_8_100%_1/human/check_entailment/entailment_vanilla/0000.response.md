Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string `s` as input and initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of consecutive '1's and `ans` to store the total cost. It then iterates through the string, incrementing `n` whenever it encounters a '1'. When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it increments `ans` by `n + 1`, which represents the cost of shifting the consecutive '1's to the right of the '0'.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The reasoning for correctness is as follows:

* The problem statement allows for any number of operations, and the cost is only dependent on the length of the chosen substring. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to minimize the number of operations while maximizing the length of the substrings being shifted.
* `func_1` correctly identifies the consecutive '1's and calculates the cost of shifting them to the right of the '0's. This is because shifting a substring of length `n` to the right of a '0' will result in a cost of `n + 1`, as the '0' needs to be moved to the left of the shifted substring.
* By iterating through the string only once, `func_1` has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
* `func_2` simply calls `func_1` for each test case, which is correct as it allows for multiple test cases to be processed.

Correctness: **True**
