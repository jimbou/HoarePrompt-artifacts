Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input and calculates the minimum total cost to make it sorted. It does this by iterating through the string and keeping track of the number of '1's encountered so far (`n`). Whenever it encounters a '0' that is preceded by at least one '1', it increments the answer (`ans`) by `n + 1`. This is because the cost of shifting a substring of length `n + 1` is `n + 1`. The final value of `ans` is the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

`func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then calls `func_1` for each test case, passing the corresponding binary string as input.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the binary string, which is within the acceptable limits.

Correctness: **True**
