Output State: **The output state is the same as the initial state, with the variable `t` being the only one affected. After the loop finishes executing, `t` will be 0, and the stdin will still contain the same binary strings as before. The lengths of the binary strings will remain unchanged, between 2 and 2 * 10^5.**
