Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The key insight is to start from the end of the array and work backwards, maintaining the minimum non-negative integer `mex` that does not appear in the constructed permutation so far.

The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value, and then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`, and then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed permutation so far.

The program then prints the constructed permutation `p`, which satisfies the condition that `a[i] = mex(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for each `i`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, and the provided examples also seem to be correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
