Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of `t`, `n`, and `a` from stdin.
2. It initializes an array `p` of size `n` with all elements set to `-1`.
3. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which will be used to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p`.
4. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`). For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding value of `p[i]` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
5. The program then updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p`.
6. Finally, the program prints the values of `p` in the correct order.

The program's logic is correct because it follows the definition of the MEX function and the given formula for calculating `p[i]`. The use of the `mex` variable to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in `p` is also correct.

Therefore, the program will produce the correct output for the given input values.

Correctness: **True**
