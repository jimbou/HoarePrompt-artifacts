This function reads multiple inputs from stdin, where each input consists of an integer t, followed by t sets of inputs, each containing an integer n and n integers a_1 to a_n. It calculates and prints the values of p for each set, where p[i] is determined by the formula p[i] = mex - a[i], and mex is the minimum value of p[i] and a[i]. The function outputs t lines, each containing n integers representing the calculated values of p.
