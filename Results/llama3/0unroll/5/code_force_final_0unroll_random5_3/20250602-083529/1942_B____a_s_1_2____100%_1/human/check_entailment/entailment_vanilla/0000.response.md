Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses the concept of Minimum Excluded Value (MEX) to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an array `p` of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`. This array will store the constructed permutation.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which will keep track of the minimum excluded value.
5. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
6. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` in the permutation using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
7. It then updates the `mex` value to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum excluded value.
8. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct because it uses the definition of MEX to construct the permutation. By iterating over the array `a` in reverse order, it ensures that each element `p[i]` is calculated based on the correct MEX value.

Moreover, the program's use of the `min` function to update the `mex` value ensures that it always represents the minimum excluded value. This is crucial in constructing a valid permutation.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
