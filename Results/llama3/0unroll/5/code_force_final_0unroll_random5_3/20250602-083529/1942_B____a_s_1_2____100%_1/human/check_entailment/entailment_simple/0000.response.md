Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, where the goal is to construct a permutation `p` based on an array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, where `MEX` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation `p`. It starts from the end of the array `a` and iterates backwards. For each element `a_i`, it calculates the corresponding element `p_i` using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`, where `mex` is the minimum value of `p_i` and `a_i` is the `i-th` element of the input list `a`. The value of `mex` is updated at each step to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated `p_i`.

The program's correctness can be argued as follows:

* The program correctly initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` values and sets `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for `mex`.
* The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order, which ensures that the `MEX` value is calculated correctly for each element.
* The formula `p_i = mex - a_i` is correct, as it ensures that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` holds true.
* The program updates the `mex` value correctly at each step, ensuring that it always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

Therefore, the program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
