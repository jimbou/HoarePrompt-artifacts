Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation p based on an array a. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation p by iterating through the array a in reverse order and assigning values to p based on the formula p[i] = mex - a[i], where mex is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

The program correctly initializes the mex variable to n, which is the maximum possible value for mex. It then iterates through the array a in reverse order, assigning values to p based on the formula. The mex variable is updated at each step to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned value p[i].

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given inputs. The execution summary provided also confirms that the program is working as expected.

Correctness: **True**
