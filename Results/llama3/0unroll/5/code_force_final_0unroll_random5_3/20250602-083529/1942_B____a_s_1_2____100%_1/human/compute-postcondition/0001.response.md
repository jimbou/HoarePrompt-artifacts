Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing n integers. The integers in each line represent the values of p, which are calculated based on the input values of n and a. The values of p are determined by the formula p[i] = mex - a[i], where mex is the minimum value of p[i] and a[i] is the ith element of the input list a. The values of t and n remain unchanged.**
