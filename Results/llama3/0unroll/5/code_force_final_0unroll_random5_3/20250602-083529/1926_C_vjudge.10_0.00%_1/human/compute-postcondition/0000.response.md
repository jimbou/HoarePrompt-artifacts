Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n, where n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the sum is calculated by converting the integer n to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and summing up these integer values. The result is an integer that represents the sum of the digits of the original integer n.
