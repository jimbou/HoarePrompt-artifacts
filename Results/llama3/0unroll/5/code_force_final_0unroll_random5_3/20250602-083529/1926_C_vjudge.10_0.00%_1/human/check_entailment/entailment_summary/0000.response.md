Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. This function is then used in a loop to calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n`.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The loop `for i in range(n):` should actually be `for i in range(1, n+1):` because the problem statement specifies that Vladislav writes the integers from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The current loop starts from 0, which is not part of the problem's input range.

Additionally, the variable `soma` is not reset to 0 after each test case, which means that the sum of the digits for each test case is accumulated in `soma`. This is incorrect because the problem statement requires the sum of the digits for each test case to be output separately.

Correctness: **False**
