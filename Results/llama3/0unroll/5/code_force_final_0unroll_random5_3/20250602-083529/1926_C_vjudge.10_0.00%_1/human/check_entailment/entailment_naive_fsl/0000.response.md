Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it is not calculating the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. Instead, it is calculating the sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 0 to n.

The issue lies in the line `soma += func_1(i)`. This line is adding the sum of the digits of the current number `i` to the total sum `soma`. However, the problem statement asks for the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, not the sum of the sums of the digits.

For example, if `n = 12`, the program will calculate the sum of the sums of the digits of all numbers from 0 to 12, which is not the correct solution.

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. This can be done by adding the sum of the digits of each number to a list, and then summing up the list.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total_sum += sum(int(d) for d in str(i))
    print(total_sum)
```
This program correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.
