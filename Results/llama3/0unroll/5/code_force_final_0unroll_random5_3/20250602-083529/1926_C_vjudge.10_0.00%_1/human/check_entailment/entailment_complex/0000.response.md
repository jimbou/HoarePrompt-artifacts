Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Although its functionality is described in the comments, it is not clear if it is correctly implemented.
2. The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum of the numbers on the board, but it is not reset to 0 for each test case. This means that the sum of the numbers on the board for each test case will be added to the sum of the previous test cases, which is incorrect.
3. The loop `for i in range(n):` iterates from 0 to `n-1`, but the problem statement requires the sum of the numbers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the loop should iterate from 1 to `n`.

Considering these issues, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed.

Correctness: **False**
