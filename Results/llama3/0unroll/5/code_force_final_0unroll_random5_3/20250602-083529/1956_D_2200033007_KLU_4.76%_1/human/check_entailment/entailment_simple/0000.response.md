Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` does not take into account the actual values of the input array `a`, but instead only checks the length of the array. It then prints hardcoded values for the maximum sum and operations, which are not necessarily correct for the given input.

The program does not attempt to find the maximum sum of the elements of the array `a` or construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. It simply prints hardcoded values for the maximum sum and operations, which are not necessarily correct for the given input.

Correctness: **False**
