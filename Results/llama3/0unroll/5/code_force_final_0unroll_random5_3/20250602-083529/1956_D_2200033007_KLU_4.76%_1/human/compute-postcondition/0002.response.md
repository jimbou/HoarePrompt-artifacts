Based on the initial state, the list `c` contains 2 integers between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive), and the variable `m` is initialized to 0.

However, the print statement `print(f'4 1')` does not reference either `c` or `m`. Instead, it prints a formatted string containing the literals '4' and '1'.

Therefore, the output will be the string '4 1' without any relation to the values of `c` or `m`.

Output: **4 1**
