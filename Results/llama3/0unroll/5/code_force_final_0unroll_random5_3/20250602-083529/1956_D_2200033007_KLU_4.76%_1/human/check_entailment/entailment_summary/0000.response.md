Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The program only checks the length of the input list and prints a specific message based on that. It does not consider the actual values in the list or perform any operations to maximize the sum of the elements.

The program only handles two specific cases: when the list has exactly 2 integers, it prints '4 1' followed by '1 2', and when the list has any other length between 1 and 18 (inclusive), it prints '13 0'. However, this does not cover all possible cases, and the program does not provide a correct solution for the problem.

For example, if the input list is [1, 100, 2, 1], the program will print '13 0', which is incorrect. The correct output should be '105 2' followed by '3 3' and '3 4', as shown in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
