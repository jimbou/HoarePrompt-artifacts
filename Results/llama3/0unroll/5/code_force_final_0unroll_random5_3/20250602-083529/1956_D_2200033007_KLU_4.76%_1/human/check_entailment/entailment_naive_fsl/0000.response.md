Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the array is 2 or 3, and it does not provide a general solution for arrays of any length. For example, if the input is an array of length 4, the program will not produce the correct output.

The program also does not follow the problem description, which requires the program to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing a sequence of operations. The program does not perform any operations on the array, and it does not provide a sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to be modified to handle arrays of any length and to perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the elements.
