Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the input list is 2, and when the length is not 2. In the case where the length is 2, it prints '4 1' and '1 2', which is correct for the specific input [0, 1]. However, this does not generalize to all possible inputs of length 2.

In the case where the length is not 2, it prints '13 0', which is only correct for the specific input [1, 3, 9]. This does not generalize to all possible inputs of length not equal to 2.

The program does not provide a correct solution for the general case, where the length of the input list can be any integer between 1 and 18 (inclusive), and the integers in the list can be any value between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive).

Correctness: **False**
