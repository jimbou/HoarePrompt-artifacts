Reasoning:

The given program is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array is 2, and when the length of the array is 3. It does not handle any other cases.

2. The program does not actually calculate the maximum sum of the elements of the array. It simply prints a hardcoded value for the sum.

3. The program does not construct a sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum. It only prints a hardcoded sequence of operations for the two specific cases it handles.

4. The program does not use the input array `a` in any meaningful way. It simply appends the input values to the array, but does not use them to calculate the maximum sum or construct the sequence of operations.

5. The function `func_1` is not defined correctly. It takes a parameter `c`, but does not use it in any meaningful way. It also does not return anything, despite being defined as a function that returns a value.

6. The program does not follow the problem's requirements. It does not output the maximum sum of the elements of the array and the number of operations in the correct format. It also does not output the sequence of operations in the correct format.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
