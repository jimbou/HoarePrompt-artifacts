#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of n integers, where n is an integer between 1 and 18 (inclusive), and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive).
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: *`c` is a list of n integers, where n is an integer between 1 and 18 (inclusive), and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive), `m` is 0. If `c` is a list of 2 integers, '1 2' is printed. Otherwise, '13 0' is printed.
    return
    #The program returns nothing because there is no return statement with a value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and prints a specific message based on the length of the list. If the list has exactly 2 integers, it prints '4 1' followed by '1 2'. If the list has any other length between 1 and 18 (inclusive), it prints '13 0'. The function does not return any value.
