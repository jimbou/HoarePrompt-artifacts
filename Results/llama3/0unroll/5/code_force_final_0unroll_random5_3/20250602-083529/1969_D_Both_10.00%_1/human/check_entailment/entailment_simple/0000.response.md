Correctness: **True** 

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to maximize Alice's profit and minimize Bob's profit. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob can take for free `k`.

2. It then reads the prices of the items for Alice and Bob, and stores them in the `arr` list as pairs of integers.

3. The program sorts the `arr` list based on the prices of the items for Bob in ascending order.

4. It then creates a heap `k_arr` and pushes the `k` items with the highest prices for Bob into the heap.

5. The program calculates the initial maximum profit by calling the `func_3` function, which calculates the sum of the prices of the items in the `k_arr` heap and the sum of the prices of the items in the `arr` list where the sum of the prices of the item for Alice and Bob is greater than or equal to 0.

6. The program then enters a loop where it pops an item from the `arr` list, subtracts its price for Bob from the current maximum profit, and pushes the popped item into the `k_arr` heap.

7. If the popped item's price for Alice plus its price for Bob is less than or equal to 0, it adds the price for Alice to the current maximum profit.

8. The program then calls the `func_3` function again to calculate the new maximum profit.

9. If the new maximum profit is greater than the current maximum profit, it updates the maximum profit.

10. The program repeats steps 6-9 until the `arr` list is empty.

11. Finally, the program prints the maximum profit.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize Alice's profit and minimize Bob's profit, and it handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
