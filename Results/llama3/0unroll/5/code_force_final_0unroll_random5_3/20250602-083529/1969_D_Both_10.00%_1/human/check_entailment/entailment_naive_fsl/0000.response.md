Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit and minimize Bob's profit. The function `func_3` calculates the sum of the differences between the prices of the items Bob buys from Alice and the prices of the items Alice buys from the shop, but it does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

In the problem description, it is stated that if Alice buys less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. If Alice buys less than k items, the program should return 0 as Alice's profit, but the program does not do this.

For example, if the input is:

n = 2
k = 1
a = [1, 2]
b = [3, 4]

The program will return 3, but the correct answer is 0 because Alice buys only 1 item and Bob can take it for free.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
