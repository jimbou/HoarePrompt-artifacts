Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described, where Alice wants to maximize her profit by choosing a subset of items to buy and sell to Bob, who wants to minimize Alice's profit. The program uses a greedy approach to find the optimal solution.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly using `func_1` and `func_2`, which return the number of test cases, the number of items, and the prices for Alice and Bob.
2. The program sorts the items based on their prices for Bob in ascending order, which is correct because Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
3. The program uses a heap to store the `k` items with the highest prices for Bob, which is correct because Bob will take these items for free.
4. The program calculates the maximum profit for Alice by iterating through the sorted items and updating the heap accordingly. The `func_3` function is used to calculate the total sum of prices for Bob and the combined prices for Alice and Bob where the total price is non-negative.
5. The program prints the maximum profit for Alice, which is the correct output.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses the right data structures and algorithms to solve the problem efficiently. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
