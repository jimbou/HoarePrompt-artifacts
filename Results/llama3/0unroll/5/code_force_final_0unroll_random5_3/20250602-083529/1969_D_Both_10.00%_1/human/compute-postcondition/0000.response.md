Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively; `sub_summ` is 0**

In this output state, the initial state of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify these variables. The code only introduces a new variable `sub_summ` and initializes it to 0.
