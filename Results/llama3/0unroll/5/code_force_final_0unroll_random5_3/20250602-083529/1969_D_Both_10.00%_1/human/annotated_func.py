#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(putin())
    #The program returns an integer greater than 0 that was input by the user.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer greater than 0 from standard input and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: putin() is a function that returns a string of space-separated integers.
    return map(int, putin().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a result of converting a string of space-separated integers returned by the putin() function into an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing a sequence of integers. The integers are the result of converting a string of space-separated integers into individual integers. The string of space-separated integers is obtained from the putin() function. The function does not modify any input variables, as it does not accept any parameters. The final state of the program is that it returns a map object containing the converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar and sec_arr are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively.
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
        
    #State: Output State: `main_arr` and `sec_arr` are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively; `sub_summ` is the sum of the prices of all items for Bob.
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: Output State: `main_arr` and `sec_arr` are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively; `sub_summ` is the sum of the prices of all items for Bob, plus the sum of the prices of items for Alice and Bob where the sum of their prices is greater than or equal to 0.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns the sum of the prices of all items for Bob, plus the sum of the prices of items for Alice and Bob where the sum of their prices is greater than or equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates the total sum of prices for Bob and the combined prices for Alice and Bob where the total price is non-negative. It takes two lists of pairs of integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, and returns the calculated total sum. The function does not modify the input lists.
