The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object containing a sequence of integers. The integers are the result of converting a string of space-separated integers into individual integers. The string of space-separated integers is obtained from the putin() function. The function does not modify any input variables, as it does not accept any parameters. The final state of the program is that it returns a map object containing the converted integers.
