stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n). The second line contains two lists of n integers each: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
