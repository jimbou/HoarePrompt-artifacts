Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array by repeatedly appending the maximum or minimum possible value to the array, depending on whether X is even or odd. The program also correctly handles the case where X is 1, in which case the array is empty.

The program's use of the `max` and `min` variables to keep track of the maximum and minimum possible values for the array elements is also correct. The program's reversal of the array at the end is also necessary to ensure that the array is in the correct order.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
