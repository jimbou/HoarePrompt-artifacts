Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array by appending the maximum or minimum value to the array based on whether the current value of X is even or odd.

The program correctly handles the base case where X is 1, in which case the array is empty. For X greater than 1, the program enters a while loop that continues until X is reduced to 1.

Inside the loop, the program checks whether X is even or odd. If X is even, it appends the maximum value to the array and divides X by 2. If X is odd, it appends the minimum value to the array and decrements X by 1.

After the loop, the program reverses the array and prints its length and contents.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
