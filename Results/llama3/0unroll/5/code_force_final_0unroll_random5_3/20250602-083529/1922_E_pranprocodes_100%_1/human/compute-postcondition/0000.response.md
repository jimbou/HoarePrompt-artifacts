Output State: **The output state will contain the number of test cases (which remains unchanged) followed by the modified list of integers. Each integer in the list will be replaced by the number of operations (t) required to reduce it to 1, followed by the sequence of numbers (ans) obtained by reversing the sequence of operations performed on the original number. The sequence of numbers will start with the maximum or minimum value (depending on whether the original number was even or odd) and will decrease or increase by 1 in each step, respectively.**
