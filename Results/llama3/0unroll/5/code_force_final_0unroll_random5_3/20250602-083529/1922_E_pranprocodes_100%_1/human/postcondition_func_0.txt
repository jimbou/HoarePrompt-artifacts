This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer X. It then performs a sequence of operations on each X, repeatedly dividing by 2 if X is even or subtracting 1 if X is odd, until X becomes 1. The function keeps track of the number of operations (t) and the sequence of numbers obtained by reversing the sequence of operations. Finally, it prints the number of operations (t) and the reversed sequence of numbers for each test case.
