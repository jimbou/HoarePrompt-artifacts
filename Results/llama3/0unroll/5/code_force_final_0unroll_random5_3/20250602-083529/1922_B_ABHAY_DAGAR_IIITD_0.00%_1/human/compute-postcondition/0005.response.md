Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the number of triplets that can be formed from a list of integers for each test case. It accepts a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains an integer n and a list of n integers. The function processes each test case, counts the occurrences of each integer, and calculates the number of triplets that can be formed using the counted integers. Finally, it prints the calculated number of triplets for each test case.**
