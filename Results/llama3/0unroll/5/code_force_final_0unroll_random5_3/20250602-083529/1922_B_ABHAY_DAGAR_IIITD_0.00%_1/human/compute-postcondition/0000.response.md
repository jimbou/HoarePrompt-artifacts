Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i <= n, `results` is an empty list**.

In natural language, the output state is that the list of test cases remains unchanged, and a new empty list called `results` has been created.
