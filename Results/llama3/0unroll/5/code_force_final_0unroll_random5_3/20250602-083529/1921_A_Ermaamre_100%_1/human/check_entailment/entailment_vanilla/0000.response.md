Reasoning:

1. The problem asks to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and its area is positive (strictly greater than 0).

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, the program reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square and stores them in a 2D list `a`.

4. It then extracts the x-coordinates of the corners into a list `x`.

5. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`) and squares it to find the area of the square.

6. The program prints the calculated area for each test case.

7. The program does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases, but the problem statement guarantees that the inputs will be valid.

8. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
