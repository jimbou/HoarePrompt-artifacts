Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square and stores them in a list of lists `a`.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates from the list of corners and stores them in a separate list `x`.
4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which represents the length of the side of the square (`dx`).
5. It calculates the area of the square by squaring the length of the side (`dx * dx`) and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners. The execution summary also confirms that the program reads the input correctly, calculates the area, and prints the results without modifying the input.

Correctness: **True**
