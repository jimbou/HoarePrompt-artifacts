Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (dx) and then squaring it. This is because the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, so the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates represents the length of one side of the square. Squaring this length gives the area of the square.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the input coordinates are negative or have different orders. The use of the `max` and `min` functions ensures that the program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, regardless of their order in the input.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
