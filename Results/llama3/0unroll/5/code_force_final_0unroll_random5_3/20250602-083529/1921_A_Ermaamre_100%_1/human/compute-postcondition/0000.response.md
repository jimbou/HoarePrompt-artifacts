The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains one integer t (1 <= t <= 100) first and then 4t lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000). So, after accepting the integer t, stdin now contains 4t lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000). The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The values of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000)**
