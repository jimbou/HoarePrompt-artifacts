Output State: **The number of good subarrays is updated to include all subarrays of length m in list a that have at least k matches with list b plus one, the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of list a is updated in window_freq, and the total matches between the last m elements of list a and list b is updated in matches. The current value of matches is greater than or equal to k.**

In this output state, the value of good_subarrays has been incremented by 1, indicating that the current subarray of length m in list a has at least k matches with list b. The values of window_freq and matches remain the same, as they were already updated to reflect the current state of the last m elements of list a and their matches with list b.
