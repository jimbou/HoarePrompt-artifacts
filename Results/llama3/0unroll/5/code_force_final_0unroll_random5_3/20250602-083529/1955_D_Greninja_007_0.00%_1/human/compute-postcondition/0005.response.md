Postcondition: ***The number of good subarrays is updated to include all subarrays of length m in list a that have at least k matches with list b. The frequency of each integer in the last m elements of list a is updated in window_freq, and the total matches between the last m elements of list a and list b is updated in matches. If the total matches between the last m elements of list a and list b is greater than or equal to k, then the number of good subarrays is incremented by one.***
