Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
WBW
BWB
WBW
```

In this case, the program will output "YES", but it is actually not possible to make all squares the same color. The program only checks if the first and last rows or columns are the same color, but it does not consider the case where the middle rows or columns are different colors.

To fix this issue, the program needs to check all rows and columns, not just the first and last ones. It can do this by iterating over all rows and columns and checking if any of them have different colors. If it finds any, it should output "NO". Otherwise, it should output "YES".
