Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first and last rows of the grid are the same color, and if the first and last columns of the grid are the same color. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just rotating the first and last rows. Therefore, the program's logic is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

WWWWWW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW

The program would print 'NO' for this grid, but it is actually possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing a series of operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
