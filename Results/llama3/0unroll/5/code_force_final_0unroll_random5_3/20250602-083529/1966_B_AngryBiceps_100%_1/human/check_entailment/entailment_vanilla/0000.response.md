Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first and last rows of the grid are the same color, and if the first and last columns of the grid are the same color. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just one. Therefore, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color even if the first and last rows or columns are not the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW

The first and last rows are not the same color, and the first and last columns are not the same color. However, it is possible to make all squares in the grid white by performing two operations: first, select positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 ≤ x ≤ 2 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 4 to white, and then select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all squares with 2 ≤ x ≤ 3 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 4 to white.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
