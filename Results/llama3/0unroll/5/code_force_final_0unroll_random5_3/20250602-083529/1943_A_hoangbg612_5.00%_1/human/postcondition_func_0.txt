This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then processes each list by sorting it, counting the occurrences of each integer, and finding the largest integer 'cur' such that the number of elements less than or equal to 'cur' is greater than 'cur'. The function prints the value of 'cur' for each test case, effectively determining the maximum value that satisfies the given condition for each input list.
