Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game's logic and calculates the final score. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first sorts the input array `N` in ascending order. This is necessary to ensure that the game is played optimally, as Alice and Bob need to consider the smallest available numbers first.

2. The program then initializes a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in the array. It also initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will be used to keep track of the current smallest number that has not been played.

3. The program then iterates through the sorted array `N`. For each number `num`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur`. If it is, and `num` is not equal to `cur + 1`, it means that `cur + 1` has not been played, so the program increments `cur` and breaks the loop. If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it means that `cur + 1` has been played, so the program updates `cur` to `num` and increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. After the loop, the program checks if the total count of numbers in the dictionary `M` is equal to the size of the input array `S`. If it is, it means that all numbers have been played, so the program increments `cur` by 1.

5. Finally, the program iterates through the numbers from 0 to `cur - 1` and checks if the count of each number in the dictionary `M` is less than or equal to the number itself. If it finds such a number, it means that the number has not been played, so it updates `cur` to that number and breaks the loop.

6. The program then prints the final value of `cur`, which is the game's score.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the cases where the input array contains duplicate numbers or where the numbers in the array are not consecutive. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
