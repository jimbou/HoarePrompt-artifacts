Output State: **The output state will be the largest integer `cur` such that the number of elements in the sorted list `N` that are less than or equal to `cur` is greater than `cur`. This value will be printed for each test case. The value of `T` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The input state of `stdin` will also remain unchanged, as the loop only reads from it and does not modify it.**
