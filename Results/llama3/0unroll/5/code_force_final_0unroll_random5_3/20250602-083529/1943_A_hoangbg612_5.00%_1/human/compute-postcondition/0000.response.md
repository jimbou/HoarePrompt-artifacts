Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^4. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of n and a_i are still within their respective ranges.
