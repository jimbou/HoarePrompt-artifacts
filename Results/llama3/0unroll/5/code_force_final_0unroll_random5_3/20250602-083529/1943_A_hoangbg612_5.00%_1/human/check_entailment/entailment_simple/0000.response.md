Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

The program first reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`. It then sorts the array `a` in ascending order.

The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each element in the sorted array `a`. It iterates over the sorted array and updates the count of each element in the dictionary `M`.

The program then checks if the sum of the counts of all elements in the dictionary `M` is equal to the size of the array `n`. If it is, it increments the value of `cur` by 1.

The program then iterates over the range of `cur` and checks if the count of each element in the dictionary `M` is less than or equal to the element itself. If it finds such an element, it sets the value of `cur` to that element and breaks the loop.

Finally, the program prints the value of `cur`, which represents the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
