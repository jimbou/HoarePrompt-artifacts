Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of a single integer `n` representing the size of the list, followed by a list of `n` integers.
2.  It sorts the list of integers, which is necessary to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of the list.
3.  It initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will be used to keep track of the current MEX.
4.  It creates a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each integer in the sorted list.
5.  It iterates through the sorted list, updating the `cur` variable and the `M` dictionary accordingly. If it encounters a number that is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks out of the loop because it has found the MEX.
6.  After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in the `M` dictionary is equal to the size of the list `S`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
7.  It then iterates through the range of `cur` and checks if the count of each integer in the `M` dictionary is less than or equal to the integer itself. If it finds such an integer, it sets `cur` to that integer and breaks out of the loop.
8.  Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the list.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of a list, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the list. It also correctly handles the case where the list contains all non-negative integers up to a certain number, in which case the MEX is the next integer.

Correctness: **True**
