Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
3. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
4. It initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will keep track of the current MEX value.
5. It creates a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each element in the array `a`.
6. It iterates over the sorted array `a` and updates the `cur` variable and the `M` dictionary accordingly. If an element is greater than `cur`, it increments `cur` and breaks the loop if `cur` is greater than the current element. If an element is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the frequency of that element in the `M` dictionary.
7. After iterating over the entire array, it checks if the sum of the frequencies in the `M` dictionary is equal to the size of the array `n`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
8. Finally, it iterates over the range of `cur` and checks if the frequency of each element in the `M` dictionary is less than or equal to the element itself. If it finds such an element, it sets `cur` to that element and breaks the loop.
9. The program prints the final value of `cur`, which represents the MEX of the array `c` and the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the code:

* The variable names `S`, `N`, and `M` are not descriptive and could be renamed to something more meaningful.
* The program uses a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each element, but it only uses the keys of the dictionary. A list or an array would be a more suitable data structure for this purpose.
* The program uses a loop to iterate over the range of `cur` to find the final MEX value. This loop is not necessary, and the program could simply return the value of `cur` after the previous loop.

Despite these minor issues, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
