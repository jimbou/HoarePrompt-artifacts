This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then checks if the sum of the differences between each number and the last number in the list is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case and consumes all input from standard input.
