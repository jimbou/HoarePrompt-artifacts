Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of containers and the amounts of water in each container. It then calculates the difference between each amount and the last amount, and sums up these differences. If the sum is zero, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by the number of containers, which is a necessary condition for it to be possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
