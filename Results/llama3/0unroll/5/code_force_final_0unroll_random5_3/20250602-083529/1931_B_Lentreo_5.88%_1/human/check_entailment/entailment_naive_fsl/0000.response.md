Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

6
1
43
2
1 3
5
4 5 2 1 3
3
1 2 3
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4

The program will output:

YES
NO
YES
NO
NO
YES

However, the correct output should be:

YES
NO
YES
NO
NO
YES
NO

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the sum of the differences between each element and the last element is zero. However, this is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

A correct solution would need to check if the cumulative sum of the differences between each element and the average is always non-negative. This is because we can only pour water from one container to another if the source container has more water than the average.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        avg = sum(nums) // n
        cum_sum = 0
        for i in nums:
            cum_sum += i - avg
            if cum_sum < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

This program correctly checks if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.
