Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, depending on whether the sum of the differences between each number and the last number in the list is zero or not, for each test case. The value of `t` will be unchanged, and the input from stdin will be consumed.**
