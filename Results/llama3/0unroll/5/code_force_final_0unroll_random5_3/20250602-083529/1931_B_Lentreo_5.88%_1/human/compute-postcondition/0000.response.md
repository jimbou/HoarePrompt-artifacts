Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case, including an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, with the same constraints as before. The value of `t` has been updated, but the other variables and inputs remain unchanged.
