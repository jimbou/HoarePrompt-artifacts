Functionality: This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It first reads an integer n, then a list of n integers, and calculates the XOR of each element with the previous element in the list. It then initializes two lists, pre and suf, to keep track of the count of 1s and 0s for each bit position in the prefix list. The function then iterates through the prefix list from right to left, updating the suf list with the correct count of 1s and 0s for each bit position. After that, it iterates through the prefix list from left to right, updating the pre list with the correct count of 1s and 0s for each bit position and calculating the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s for each bit position. Finally, it prints the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s for each bit position.
