Output State: The prefix list still contains n+1 elements, where each element is the XOR of the corresponding element in the arr list and the previous element in the prefix list. The value of n and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The contents of the arr list and the prefix list are still being printed. The two new lists, pre and suf, each contain 32 sublists, but now each sublist in pre has been updated to [1, 0], while the sublists in suf remain unchanged at [0, 0].
