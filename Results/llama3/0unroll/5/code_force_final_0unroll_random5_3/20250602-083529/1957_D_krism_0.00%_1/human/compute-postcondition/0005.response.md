The code prints the `arr` list and the `prefix` list. The `arr` list contains the original elements, while the `prefix` list contains the XOR of each element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`. Since the exact elements in `arr` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `prefix`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the original list `arr` and the calculated prefix list.

Output: **[arr list], [prefix list where each element is the XOR of the corresponding element in arr and the previous element in prefix]**
