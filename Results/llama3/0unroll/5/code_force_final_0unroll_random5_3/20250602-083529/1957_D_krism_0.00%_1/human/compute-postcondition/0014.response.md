The `print(suf)` statement will print the contents of the `suf` list, which contains 32 sublists. Each sublist in `suf` contains the correct count of 1s and 0s for each bit position in the `prefix` list.

Since the `prefix` list contains n+1 elements, where each element is the XOR of the corresponding element in the `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, the counts in the `suf` list will reflect the distribution of 1s and 0s in the `prefix` list.

However, without knowing the exact values in the `arr` list and the `prefix` list, we cannot determine the exact counts of 1s and 0s in the `suf` list.

Output: **A list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the count of 1s and 0s for each bit position in the prefix list**
