Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the results. It first reads an integer n, then a list of n integers, and calculates the prefix XOR of the list. It then initializes two lists, pre and suf, to keep track of the count of 1s and 0s for each bit position in the prefix list. The function then iterates over the prefix list from right to left, updating the suf list with the correct counts. After that, it iterates over the prefix list from left to right, updating the pre list and calculating the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s for each bit position. Finally, it prints the sum. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to process and print the results of the input data.**
