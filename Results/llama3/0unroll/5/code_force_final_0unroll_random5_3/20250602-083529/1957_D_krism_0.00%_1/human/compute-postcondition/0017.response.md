Output State: The prefix list still contains n+1 elements, where each element is the XOR of the corresponding element in the arr list and the previous element in the prefix list. The value of n remains unchanged. The contents of the arr list and the prefix list are still being printed. The two new lists, pre and suf, each contain 32 sublists. Each sublist in pre now contains the correct count of 1s and 0s for each bit position in the prefix list, and the contents of the pre list are printed, and the contents of the suf list are printed. The variable ans is assigned the value equal to the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s for each bit position in the prefix list.
