Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a list of n integers, prefix is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input: a single integer and n integers, '-----------------' is being printed**

This output state reflects the combined effect of all lines in the code snippet. The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer equal to the first input. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin and assigns them to `arr`, which is now a list of `n` integers. The third line initializes `prefix` as a list containing a single element 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each consisting of a single integer and `n` integers. Additionally, '-----------------' is being printed.
