Output State: The prefix list now contains n+1 elements, where each element is the XOR of the corresponding element in the arr list and the previous element in the prefix list. The value of n and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The contents of the arr list and the prefix list are being printed. Additionally, two new lists, pre and suf, have been created, each containing 32 sublists, with each sublist initialized to [1, 0].
