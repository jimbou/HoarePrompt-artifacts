The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. 

After executing the code, the value of `num_tests` is the integer t that was read from the standard input. The value of t is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). 

The stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
