Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The given program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the list of sign periodicities and updating the start year for each sign.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and the number of signs (`n`) for each test case.
2.  It then reads the periodicities of the signs (`nums`) for each test case.
3.  The program initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign occurs.
4.  The program iterates through the list of sign periodicities (`nums`). For each sign, it updates the `start_year` by finding the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`. This is done using the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
5.  After updating the `start_year` for all signs, the program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
