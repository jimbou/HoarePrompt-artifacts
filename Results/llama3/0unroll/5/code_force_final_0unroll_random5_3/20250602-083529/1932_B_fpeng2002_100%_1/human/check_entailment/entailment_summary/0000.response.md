Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the year of occurrence for each sign, taking into account the sequential nature of the signs.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and the periodicities of the signs (a_i).
3.  It initializes the start year to 0 and then iterates through each sign.
4.  For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by dividing the current start year by the sign's periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity. This ensures that the next sign occurs after the previous one.
5.  Finally, it prints the calculated start year for the n-th sign, which represents the year in which the apocalypse will occur.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, and it correctly implements the necessary calculations to determine the year of the apocalypse.

Correctness: **True**
