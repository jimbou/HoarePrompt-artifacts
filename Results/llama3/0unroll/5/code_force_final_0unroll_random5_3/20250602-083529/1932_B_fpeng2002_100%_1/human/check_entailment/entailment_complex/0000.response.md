Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. The program initializes the `start_year` variable to 0, which represents the year when the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by dividing the current `start_year` by the periodicity `nums[x]`, rounding up to the nearest integer using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1)`, and then multiplying the result by the periodicity `nums[x]`. This effectively calculates the next occurrence year of the sign.
5. The program prints the final `start_year` value, which represents the year when the nth sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given example inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
