Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign to be the next multiple of the sign's periodicity after the previous sign's start year. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Signs with different periodicities
* Signs with the same periodicity
* Signs with periodicities that are multiples of each other
* Signs with periodicities that are not multiples of each other

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as:

* A single sign with a periodicity of 1
* Multiple signs with periodicities of 1
* Signs with very large periodicities

Overall, the program is correct and implements the required logic correctly.
