Output State: **num_tests is 0, and the console contains the least common multiple (LCM) of the input integers for each test case.**

In this output state, the variable `num_tests` has been decremented to 0 after all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the console contains the least common multiple (LCM) of the input integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The LCM is calculated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, where `start_year` is initialized to 0 and updated iteratively for each input integer. The final value of `start_year` for each test case is printed to the console.
