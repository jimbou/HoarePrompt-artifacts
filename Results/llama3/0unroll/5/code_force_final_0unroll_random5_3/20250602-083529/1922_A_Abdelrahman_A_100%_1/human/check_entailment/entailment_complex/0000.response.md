Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not, is flawed.

The program first checks if string c is equal to either string a or string b. If it is, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because if c is equal to a or b, then there cannot exist a template t that a and b match but c does not.

However, the program then checks if each character in string c is not present in the corresponding positions in strings a and b. If it finds such a character, it prints 'YES'. This is incorrect because the problem statement requires that the template t should be such that a and b match it, but c does not. The program's logic does not ensure this.

For example, consider the test case where a = "aa", b = "bb", and c = "ab". The program will print 'YES' because the first character 'a' in c is not present in the first position of b, and the second character 'b' in c is not present in the second position of a. However, there does not exist a template t that a and b match but c does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
