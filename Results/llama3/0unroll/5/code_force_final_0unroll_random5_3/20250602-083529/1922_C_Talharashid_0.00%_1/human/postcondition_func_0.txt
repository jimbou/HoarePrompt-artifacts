This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, a list of n unique integers in ascending order, and an integer m, followed by m queries. For each query, it calculates the minimum sum of differences between the start and end indices in the list, considering both forward and backward directions. The function prints the minimum sum for each query. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and updates the variables accordingly.
