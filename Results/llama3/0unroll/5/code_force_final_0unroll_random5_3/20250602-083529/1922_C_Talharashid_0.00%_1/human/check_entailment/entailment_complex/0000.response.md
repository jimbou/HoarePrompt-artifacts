Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum sum of differences between the start and end indices in the list for each query, considering both forward and backward directions. The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list, calculated in both forward and backward directions. This allows the program to efficiently calculate the minimum sum for each query.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the start index is greater than the end index, and when the start and end indices are the same.

The program's time complexity is O(n + m), where n is the number of elements in the list and m is the number of queries. This is because the program iterates over the list once to calculate the cumulative sums, and then iterates over the queries to calculate the minimum sums.

The program's space complexity is O(n), as it uses two dictionaries to store the cumulative sums, each of which has a size of n.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
