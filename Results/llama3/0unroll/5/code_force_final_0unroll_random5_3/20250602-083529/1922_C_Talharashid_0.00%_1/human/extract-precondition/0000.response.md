Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in ascending order, and then an integer m. Then m lines follow; the i-th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i).**
