#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer t, then an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in ascending order, and then an integer m. Then m lines follow; the i-th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i).
    t = int(input())

    #State: The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is the result of the last iteration. The variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The variable `t` is still an integer, but its value has been decremented by the number of iterations. The variable `stdin` is empty, as all the test cases have been processed. The variables `d1` and `d2` are dictionaries that store the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the list `lst`, calculated in both forward and backward directions. The variable `n` is the number of elements in the last test case, and `lst` is the list of unique integers in ascending order from the last test case. The variable `m` is the number of queries in the last test case, and the variables `start` and `end` are the last query's start and end indices. The variable `s` is the minimum sum of the differences between the start and end indices, calculated using the dictionaries `d1` and `d2`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, a list of n unique integers in ascending order, and an integer m, followed by m queries. For each query, it calculates the minimum sum of differences between the start and end indices in the list, considering both forward and backward directions. The function prints the minimum sum for each query. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and updates the variables accordingly.
