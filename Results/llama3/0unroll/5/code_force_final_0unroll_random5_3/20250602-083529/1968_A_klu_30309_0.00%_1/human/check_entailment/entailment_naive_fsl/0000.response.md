Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(x)` correctly finds the integer `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y` for a given integer `x`.

The function iterates over the range of possible values for `y` in descending order, starting from `x - 1` and ending at `1`. For each `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). If `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`, it returns `y` immediately, as this is the optimal solution.

If no such `y` is found, the function returns the maximum value of `y` that was found during the iteration, which is stored in the variable `max_val`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `x` is a prime number or `x` is a power of 2. In these cases, the function returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x`, which is the correct solution.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is `Correctness: **True**`.
