Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer y (1 ≤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The provided program uses a function `func_1(x)` to find the optimal y.

The function `func_1(x)` iterates from x-1 down to 2 and checks if x is divisible by y (i.e., x % y == 0). If it finds a y that satisfies this condition and 2*y ≥ x, it returns y immediately. If no such y is found, it returns the largest factor of x less than x/2.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function. It finds the largest factor of x that is less than x/2, or returns x/2 if it is a factor of x, otherwise returns the largest factor of x less than x/2.

This approach is correct because the gcd(x, y) + y is maximized when y is the largest factor of x that is less than x/2. This is because the gcd(x, y) is maximized when y is a factor of x, and adding y to the gcd(x, y) will result in a larger value when y is larger.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
