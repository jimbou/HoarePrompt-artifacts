Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer y (1 ≤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The given program attempts to solve this problem by finding the largest factor of x that is less than x/2.

The function `func_1(x)` iterates from x-1 down to 2 and checks if x is divisible by the current number y. If x is divisible by y and 2*y is greater than or equal to x, it returns y. This is because if y is a factor of x and 2*y ≥ x, then gcd(x, y) + y = y + y = 2*y, which is the maximum possible value.

If no such y is found, the function returns the largest factor of x that is less than x/2, which is stored in `max_val`.

The key insight here is that if y is a factor of x and y < x/2, then gcd(x, y) = y. Therefore, maximizing gcd(x, y) + y is equivalent to maximizing y.

The program's approach is correct because it finds the largest factor of x that is less than x/2, which is the maximum possible value of y that satisfies the condition.

Correctness: **True**
