Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine who will win the game based on the number of "U"s in the string. The program reads the input correctly, counts the number of "U"s in each string, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if it's even. This is in line with the problem description, which states that Alice will win if the number of "U"s is odd and Bob will win if it's even.

Correctness: **True**
