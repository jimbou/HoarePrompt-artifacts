Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method.
2. It then iterates over the test cases using a `for` loop, where each iteration processes one test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.
4. It counts the number of 'U' coins using the `count()` method and checks if the count is odd or even using the modulo operator (`%`).
5. Based on the parity of the count, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' to indicate whether Alice will win the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the input and output correctly. The use of the `count()` method to count the number of 'U' coins is efficient, and the modulo operator is used correctly to determine the parity of the count.

Correctness: **True**
