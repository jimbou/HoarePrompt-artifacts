Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the output according to the problem description.

The key insight in this problem is that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win. The program uses the fact that if the number of "U"s in the string is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because Alice goes first, and she can always choose a "U" coin, leaving an even number of "U"s for Bob. If Bob tries to choose a "U" coin, he will leave an odd number of "U"s for Alice, and so on.

The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of "U"s in each string and printing "YES" if the count is odd, and "NO" if it's even.

Correctness: **True**
