Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The problem description states that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win. However, the program only checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. This is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

For example, consider the case where n = 4 and s = "UUDD". The program will print 'NO', but this is incorrect. The correct winner of the game can be determined by analyzing the sequence of moves, not just the number of 'U's.

To correctly determine the winner of the game, the program needs to simulate the game and check who wins after a finite number of operations. The current program does not do this, and therefore is incorrect.
