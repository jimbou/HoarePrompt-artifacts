Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints output. It reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". The function then counts the number of "U"s in each string and prints "YES" if the count is odd, and "NO" if it's even. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the input variables unchanged.**
