Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position to split the string into two parts, such that the number of 0s in the left part and the number of 1s in the right part are as close to half of the total length as possible. The program handles all possible cases, including when the optimal split point is at the beginning or end of the string, and when there are multiple possible split points. It also correctly chooses the split point that is closer to the middle of the string when there are multiple possible split points.

Correctness: **True**
