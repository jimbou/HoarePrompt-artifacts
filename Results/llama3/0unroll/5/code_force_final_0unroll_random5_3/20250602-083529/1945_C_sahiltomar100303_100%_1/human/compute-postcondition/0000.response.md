Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (greater than or equal to 3) and then a string of the same length consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, which is the first input from the stdin. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, because one test case has been read and processed. Each remaining test case still contains two inputs: an integer (greater than or equal to 3) and a string of the same length consisting only of 0 and 1.
