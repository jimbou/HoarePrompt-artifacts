Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position to split the string into two parts, such that the number of 0s in the left part and the number of 1s in the right part are as close to half of the total length as possible. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the optimal split point is at the beginning or end of the string. The program's output matches the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
