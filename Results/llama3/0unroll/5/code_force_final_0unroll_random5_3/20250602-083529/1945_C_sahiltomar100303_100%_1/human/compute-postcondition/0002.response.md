Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) and a string (s) of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It then analyzes the string to find the optimal position to split it into two parts, such that the number of 0s in the left part and the number of 1s in the right part are as close to half of the total length as possible. The function prints the position of the split point for each test case. If there are multiple possible split points, it chooses the one that is closer to the middle of the string. If all possible split points are equally distant from the middle, it prints the position of the leftmost split point.**
