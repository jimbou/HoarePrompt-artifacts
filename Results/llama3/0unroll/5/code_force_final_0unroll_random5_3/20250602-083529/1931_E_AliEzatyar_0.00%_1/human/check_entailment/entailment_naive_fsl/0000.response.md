Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The game logic states that Sasha must extract two elements from the list, concatenate them in any order, and insert the result back into the list. However, the program does not consider the case where Sasha can concatenate two elements in different orders.

For example, consider the input:

3 5
9 56 1

The program will output "Anna", but Sasha can actually win by concatenating 9 and 56 to get 956, and then concatenating 1 to get 9561, which is greater than 10^5.

The program only considers the case where Sasha concatenates the elements in the order they appear in the list, but it does not consider the case where Sasha can concatenate them in a different order. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
