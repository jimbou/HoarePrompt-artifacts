stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains one integer n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. t, n, and a_i are integers such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
