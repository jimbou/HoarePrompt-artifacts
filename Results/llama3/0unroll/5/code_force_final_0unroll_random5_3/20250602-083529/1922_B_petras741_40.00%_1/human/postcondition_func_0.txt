This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates and prints the number of triplets that can be formed from the given integers, considering all possible combinations. If the number of integers n is less than 3, it prints 0. The function processes each test case independently and prints the result for each case.
