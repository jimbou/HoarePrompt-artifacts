Output State: **j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the variable j will point to the first element in the array that is different from the next element. If all elements in the array are the same, j will point to the second last element of the array.
