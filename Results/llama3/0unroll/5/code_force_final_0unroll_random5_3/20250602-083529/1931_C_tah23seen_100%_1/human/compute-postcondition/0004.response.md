Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the difference of j and i minus 1, and 0. Since j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same, and the current value of the first element of arr is the same as the last element of arr, the returned value is the maximum number of consecutive elements that are the same at the beginning of arr, minus 1, or 0 if there are no consecutive elements.**
