#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between the difference of j and i minus 1, and 0. Since j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same, and the current value of the first element of arr is the same as the last element of arr, the returned value is the maximum number of consecutive elements that are the same at the beginning of arr, minus 1, or 0 if there are no consecutive elements.
    #State: *j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same. The first element of arr is not equal to the last element of arr.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of n-i-1 and j, and 0, where j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same, and i is an index that is not specified in the initial state but is used in the calculation.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum number of consecutive elements that are the same at the beginning of the input list `arr`, minus 1, or 0 if there are no consecutive elements. If the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of the length of `arr` minus the index of the first different element minus 1, and the index of the first different element from the end, or 0.
