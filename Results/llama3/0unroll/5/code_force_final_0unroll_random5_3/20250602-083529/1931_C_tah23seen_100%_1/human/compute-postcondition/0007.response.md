Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum number of consecutive elements that are the same at the beginning of the input list `arr`, minus 1, or 0 if there are no consecutive elements. If the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of the length of `arr` minus the index of the first different element minus 1, and the index of the first different element from the end, or 0.**
