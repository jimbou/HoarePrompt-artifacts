Output State: **arr is a list of integers, i is 0, n is the length of arr, j is the last index of arr**

In this code snippet, three new variables are introduced: `i`, `n`, and `j`. The first line assigns the value 0 to `i`. The second line assigns the length of the list `arr` to `n`. The third line assigns the last index of the list `arr` to `j`. The list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
