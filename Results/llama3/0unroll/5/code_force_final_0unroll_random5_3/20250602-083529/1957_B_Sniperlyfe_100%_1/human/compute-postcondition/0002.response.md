Output State: **nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 1, k is 0, nums[0] is increased by 0**

In this output state, the value of nums[0] is increased by k, which is 0. Therefore, the value of nums[0] remains the same, which is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1. The values of the other elements in the list and the value of k remain unchanged.
