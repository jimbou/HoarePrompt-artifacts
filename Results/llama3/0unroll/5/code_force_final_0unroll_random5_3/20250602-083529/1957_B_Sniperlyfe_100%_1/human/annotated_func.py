#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 1, k is 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 1, and the first element is increased by 0, and k is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of n integers, where the first element is the largest possible value that can be represented by k bits minus 1, and all other elements are 1. The first element is then increased by the remaining value of k, which is 0. The function returns this list, effectively distributing the value of k across the list in a specific pattern.
