Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k < (1 << k.bit_length() - 1), nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and all other elements are 0.**

In this output state, the value of n remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of k is reduced by the value assigned to nums[0], which is the largest power of 2 less than k. The list nums is initialized with n zeros, and its first element is set to the largest power of 2 less than k. The remaining elements of nums are still 0.
