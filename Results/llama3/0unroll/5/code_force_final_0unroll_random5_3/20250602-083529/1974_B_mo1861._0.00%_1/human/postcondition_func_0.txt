This function decodes a given string of lowercase Latin letters by replacing each character with a corresponding character from the Latin alphabet, based on the frequency of characters in the input string. The most frequent character is mapped to 'a', the second most frequent to 'b', and so on, in reverse order of frequency. The function returns the decoded string.
