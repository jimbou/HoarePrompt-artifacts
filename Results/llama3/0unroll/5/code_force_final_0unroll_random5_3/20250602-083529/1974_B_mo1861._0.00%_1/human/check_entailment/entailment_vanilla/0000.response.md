Reasoning:

1.  The problem requires decoding a given string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. The decoding process involves replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.
2.  The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(b)` that takes the encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string `s`.
3.  Inside the function, a dictionary `char_map` is created to store the mapping between characters in `b` and their corresponding symmetric characters in `r`. The dictionary is populated by iterating over the sorted set of characters in `b` and assigning each character its symmetric character based on its position in the sorted set.
4.  The function then iterates over each character `c` in the input string `b` and appends its corresponding symmetric character from the `char_map` to the decoded string `s`.
5.  Finally, the function returns the decoded string `s`.

Correctness: **True**
