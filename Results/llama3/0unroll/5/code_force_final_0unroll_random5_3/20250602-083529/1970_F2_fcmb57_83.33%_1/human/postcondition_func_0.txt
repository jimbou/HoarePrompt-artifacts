This function takes two inputs: a list of two odd integers (N and M) and a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces. It returns two values: the sum of the first integer and the list of pairs, and the sum of the second integer and the list of pairs. The returned integers are odd and between 3 and 99. The function effectively combines the integer values with the list of pairs, but does not modify the original input lists.
