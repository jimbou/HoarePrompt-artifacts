Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem description, if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger after the move. However, in the program, when a player is eliminated, the Quaffle is not updated to remain on the cell.

For example, if the input is:

3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
.B U
.B U
.B U

The program will output:

2 R0 ELIMINATED
FINAL SCORE: 0 0

However, according to the problem description, the Quaffle should remain on the cell containing R0 and the Bludger after the move, but the program does not update the Quaffle's position correctly.
