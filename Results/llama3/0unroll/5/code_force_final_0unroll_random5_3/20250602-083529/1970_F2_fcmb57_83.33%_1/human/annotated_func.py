#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of two integers N and M, where 3 <= N, M <= 99 and N and M are odd. b is a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, where each pair of characters represents a position on the field.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns two values: x + dx and y + dy. x is an odd integer between 3 and 99, and dx is a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces. y is an odd integer between 3 and 99, and dy is a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two inputs: a list of two odd integers (N and M) and a list of N lists of M pairs of characters separated by spaces. It returns two values: the sum of the first integer and the list of pairs, and the sum of the second integer and the list of pairs. The returned integers are odd and between 3 and 99. The function effectively combines the integer values with the list of pairs, but does not modify the original input lists.
