Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a < b > c and a != c. In this case, the program should print "PEAK", but it prints "NONE". 

For example, for the input "1 5 3", the program correctly prints "PEAK". However, for the input "1 5 1", the program incorrectly prints "NONE" instead of "PEAK". 

The issue is with the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` which is not sufficient to check for the "PEAK" condition. A correct condition would be `elif a < b and b > c:`.
