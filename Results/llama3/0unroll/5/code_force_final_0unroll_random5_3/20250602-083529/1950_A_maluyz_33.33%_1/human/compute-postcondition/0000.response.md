Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains t lines, each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9), but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
