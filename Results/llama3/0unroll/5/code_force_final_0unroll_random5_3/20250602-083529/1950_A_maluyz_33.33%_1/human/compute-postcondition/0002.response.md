Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines of input, each containing three digits a, b, and c. It then classifies each set of digits into one of four categories: 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'NONE' if a == b == c, 'PEAK' if the maximum value is b, or 'NONE' otherwise. The function prints the classification for each set of digits, resulting in t lines of output. The original value of t remains unchanged.**
