Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).

    a = input()

    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)

    #State: Output State: k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers, x is the last digit of the last element in a that is greater than 10, y is the first digit of the last element in a that is greater than 10, n is the length of c, c is a list of integers where each element is either a single digit or a two-digit number, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: *k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers, x is the last digit of the last element in a that is greater than 10, y is the first digit of the last element in a that is greater than 10, n is the length of c, c is a list of integers where each element is either a single digit or a two-digit number, d is a sorted list of integers where each element is either a single digit or a two-digit number, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If c is equal to d, then b is a list with an additional element 1. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer k and a list of integers a from standard input, processes the list by splitting two-digit numbers into separate digits if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit, and then checks if the resulting list is sorted. If the list is sorted, it appends 1 to the list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function repeats this process for t-1 test cases, where t is the initial integer read from standard input.
