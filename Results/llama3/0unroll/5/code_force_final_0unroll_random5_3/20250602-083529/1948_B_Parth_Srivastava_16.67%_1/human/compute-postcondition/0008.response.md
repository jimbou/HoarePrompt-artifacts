Postcondition: ***k is an integer between 1 and 10^3, a is a list of integers, x is the last digit of the last element in a that is greater than 10, y is the first digit of the last element in a that is greater than 10, n is the length of c, c is a list of integers where each element is either a single digit or a two-digit number, d is a sorted list of integers where each element is either a single digit or a two-digit number, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If c is equal to d, then b is a list with an additional element 1. Otherwise, b is a list with an additional element 0.***
