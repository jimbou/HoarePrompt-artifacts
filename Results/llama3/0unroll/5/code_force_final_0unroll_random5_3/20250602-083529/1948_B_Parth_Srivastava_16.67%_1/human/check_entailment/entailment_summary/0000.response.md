Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the problem description and checks if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting two-digit numbers into separate digits if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the first element is a two-digit number, and when the array is already sorted. It also correctly appends 1 to the list `b` if the resulting list is sorted, and 0 otherwise.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
