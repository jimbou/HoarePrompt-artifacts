Output State: **`k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of the last element in `a` that is greater than 10, `y` is the first digit of the last element in `a` that is greater than 10, `n` is the length of `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is either a single digit or a two-digit number, `d` is a sorted list of integers where each element is either a single digit or a two-digit number, `b` is a list with an additional element 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and `c` is not equal to `d`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains a list of integers, `x` and `y` remain the last and first digits of the last element in `a` that is greater than 10, respectively. The length of `c` remains `n`, and `c` and `d` remain lists of integers with single or two-digit numbers, with `d` being sorted. The list `b` now has an additional element, 0. The number of test cases in stdin remains t-1, and `c` and `d` are still not equal.
