Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the input array contains a number that is greater than 10 and has digits that are not in non-decreasing order. For example, if the input array is [12, 31], the program will split the number 31 into digits 3 and 1, but it will not check if the resulting array [12, 3, 1] is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program will incorrectly return 'YES' in this case.

The issue is that the program only checks if the digits of a number are in non-decreasing order when the number is split, but it does not check if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order. To fix this, the program should check if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order after splitting each number.

Here is an example of how the program can be corrected:

```
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)
```

In this corrected version, the program splits each number into digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the array is sorted, the program returns 'YES', otherwise it returns 'NO'.
