Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25, such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, but for all other values v (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k), there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, where n is the upper limit of the range of values for which a subsequence with a sum of v should exist (v ≠ k), and k is the value for which no subsequence with a sum of k should exist.

3. The program initializes a list `nums` with 24 powers of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^23). This list will be used to construct the sequence.

4. It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than k by incrementing an index `idx` until 2^idx is greater than or equal to k. The largest power of 2 less than k is then 2^(idx-1).

5. The program appends three numbers to the `nums` list: k - 2^(idx-1), k + 1, and k + 2^(idx-1) + 1. These numbers are chosen to ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, but for all other values v (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k), there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

6. The program removes 2^(idx-1) from the `nums` list to ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of k.

7. Finally, the program prints the length of the `nums` list and the elements of the list.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
