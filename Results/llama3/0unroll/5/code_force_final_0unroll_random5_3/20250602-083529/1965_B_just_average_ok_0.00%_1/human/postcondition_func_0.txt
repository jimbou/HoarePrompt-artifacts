This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates a list of numbers from 1 to 2^23, replaces the number 2^idx with three new numbers (k - 2^idx, k + 1, and k + 2^idx + 1), where idx is the largest integer such that 2^idx is less than or equal to k, and prints the length of the modified list followed by the modified list itself. The function repeats this process for each test case.
