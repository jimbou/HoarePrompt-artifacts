Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It generates a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, and for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The program works by first generating a list of powers of 2 (1 << i) for i in range(24). It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k and appends k - this power of 2, k + 1, and k + this power of 2 + 1 to the list. Finally, it removes the power of 2 that was used to calculate these values.

This approach ensures that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, because the only way to get a sum of k would be to include the power of 2 that was removed, which is not possible. At the same time, for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v, because the list contains all powers of 2 up to 2^24, which is greater than n.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where k is 1 or n. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
