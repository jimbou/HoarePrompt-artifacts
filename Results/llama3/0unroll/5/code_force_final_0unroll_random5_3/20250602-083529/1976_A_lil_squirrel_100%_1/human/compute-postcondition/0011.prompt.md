You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in password, digits is a list of all the digits in password.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in password, digits is a list of all the digits in password, and the letters in the password are in sorted order
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in password, digits is a list of all the digits in password, the letters in the password are in sorted order, and the digits in the password are in sorted order
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop finishes all its iterations without returning 'NO', and the state of the variables remains unchanged. The password is still a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, the letters are still in sorted order, and the digits are still in sorted order.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES' indicating that the password meets the specified conditions, having a length of n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with letters in sorted order and digits in sorted order.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns the string 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns the string 'YES' indicating that the password meets the specified conditions, having a length of n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with letters in sorted order and digits in sorted order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
