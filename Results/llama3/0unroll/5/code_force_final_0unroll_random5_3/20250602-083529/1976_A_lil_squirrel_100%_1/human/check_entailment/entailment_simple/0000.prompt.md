Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in password, digits is a list of all the digits in password.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in password, digits is a list of all the digits in password, and the letters in the password are in sorted order
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in password, digits is a list of all the digits in password, the letters in the password are in sorted order, and the digits in the password are in sorted order
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop finishes all its iterations without returning 'NO', and the state of the variables remains unchanged. The password is still a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, the letters are still in sorted order, and the digits are still in sorted order.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES' indicating that the password meets the specified conditions, having a length of n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with letters in sorted order and digits in sorted order.
