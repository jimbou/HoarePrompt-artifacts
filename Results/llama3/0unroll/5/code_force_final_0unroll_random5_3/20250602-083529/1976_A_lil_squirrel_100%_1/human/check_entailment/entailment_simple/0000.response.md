Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem description.

1.  The program first separates the letters and digits from the password into two lists, `letters` and `digits`.
2.  It then checks if the letters and digits are in sorted order. If either of them is not in sorted order, it immediately returns 'NO'.
3.  After confirming that both letters and digits are in sorted order, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
4.  If none of the above conditions are violated, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and returns the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
