Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem description. 

1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits: This condition is met as the program checks each character in the password and separates them into letters and digits.

2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter: The program checks for this condition by iterating through the password and returning 'NO' if it finds a letter followed by a digit.

3. All digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order: The program checks for this condition by comparing the list of digits with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.

4. All letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order: The program checks for this condition by comparing the list of letters with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions and returns 'YES' if the password is strong and 'NO' otherwise. 

The program also handles edge cases such as passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with repeated characters. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
