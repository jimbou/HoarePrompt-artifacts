#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

    #State: n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in password, digits is a list of all the digits in password, and the letters in the password are in sorted order

    #State: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in password, digits is a list of all the digits in password, the letters in the password are in sorted order, and the digits in the password are in sorted order

            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop finishes all its iterations without returning 'NO', and the state of the variables remains unchanged. The password is still a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, the letters are still in sorted order, and the digits are still in sorted order.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES' indicating that the password meets the specified conditions, having a length of n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, with letters in sorted order and digits in sorted order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given password meets certain conditions. It accepts a password of length n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and returns 'YES' if the password has its letters in sorted order, its digits in sorted order, and no letter is followed by a digit. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
