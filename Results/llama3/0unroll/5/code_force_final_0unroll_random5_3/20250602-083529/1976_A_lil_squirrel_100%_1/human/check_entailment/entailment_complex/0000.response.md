Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly checks if a given password meets the specified conditions:

1.  The password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2.  There are no digits that come after a letter.
3.  All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4.  All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program first separates the letters and digits from the password into two lists. It then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either the letters or digits are not sorted, the program returns 'NO'. If both are sorted, the program checks if there are any digits that come after a letter. If such a case is found, the program returns 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the password meets the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
