#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and a and b are odd.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns two positive integers, x + dx and y + dy. x + dx is equal to a + b, where a is an odd positive integer between 3 and 99, and b is an odd positive integer between 3 and 99. y + dy is also equal to a + b, where a is an odd positive integer between 3 and 99, and b is an odd positive integer between 3 and 99.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two positive odd integers, a and b, between 3 and 99, and returns two positive integers, each equal to the sum of a and b.
