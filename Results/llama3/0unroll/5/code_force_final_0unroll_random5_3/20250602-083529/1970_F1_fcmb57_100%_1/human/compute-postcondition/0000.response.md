Output State: **a and b are positive integers such that 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and a and b are odd, x is a positive integer equal to a, y is a positive integer equal to a, dx is a positive integer equal to b, dy is a positive integer equal to b.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning values to two variables. The first line assigns the value of `a` to both `x` and `y`, and the second line assigns the value of `b` to both `dx` and `dy`. Since `a` and `b` are odd positive integers within the range of 3 to 99, the assigned values to `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` will also be odd positive integers within the same range.
