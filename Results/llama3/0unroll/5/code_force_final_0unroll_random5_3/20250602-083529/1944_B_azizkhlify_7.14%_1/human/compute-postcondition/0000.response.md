Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of lines, each containing a sequence of integers. The sequence is constructed by first printing pairs of identical integers from the first half of the input sequence, then printing a single integer from the first half of the input sequence, and finally printing pairs of identical integers from the second half of the input sequence. The number of pairs and single integers printed is determined by the values of n and k.**
