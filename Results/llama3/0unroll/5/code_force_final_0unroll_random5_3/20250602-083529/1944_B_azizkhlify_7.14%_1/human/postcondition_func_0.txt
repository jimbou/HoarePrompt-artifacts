The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function prints a sequence of integers for each test case, constructed by printing pairs of identical integers from the first half of the input sequence, then a single integer from the first half, and finally pairs of identical integers from the second half. The number of pairs and single integers printed is determined by the values of n and k. The function repeats this process for all test cases in the input.
