Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two arrays of integers, a and c. It calculates and prints the minimum total absolute difference between the elements of the two arrays for each test case. If the arrays contain the same elements, the output is 0. Otherwise, the function sorts the arrays, compares elements in a way that minimizes the total absolute difference, and prints the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c for each pair of elements.**
