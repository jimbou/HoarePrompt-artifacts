Output State: **The output state contains the minimum total absolute difference between the elements of the two arrays a and c for each test case. The differences are calculated by comparing the elements of a with the elements of c in a way that minimizes the total absolute difference. If the arrays a and c contain the same elements, the output is 0. Otherwise, the output is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and c for each pair of elements.**
