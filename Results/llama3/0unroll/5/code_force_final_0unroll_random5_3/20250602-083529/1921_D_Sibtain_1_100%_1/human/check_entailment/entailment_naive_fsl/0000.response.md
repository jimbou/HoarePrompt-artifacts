Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first checks if all elements in both arrays are the same. If so, it prints 0 as the maximum difference, which is correct.

2. It then sorts Petya's array a in ascending order and Vasya's array c in descending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to compare the smallest elements in a with the largest elements in c, and the largest elements in a with the smallest elements in c, which maximizes the difference.

3. The program then initializes two pointers, i and j, to the start and end of the arrays, respectively. It also initializes a variable ans to store the maximum total difference.

4. The program then iterates over the arrays, comparing the elements at the current positions of i and j. It calculates the absolute difference between the elements at the current positions of i and j, and the absolute difference between the elements at the current positions of len(a) - j and len(c) - j.

5. The program then updates the ans variable with the maximum of the two calculated differences.

6. The program repeats steps 4 and 5 until it has iterated over all elements in the arrays.

7. Finally, the program prints the maximum total difference ans.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when all elements in both arrays are the same, when the arrays have different lengths, and when the arrays have different elements. It also correctly calculates the maximum total difference by comparing the smallest elements in a with the largest elements in c, and the largest elements in a with the smallest elements in c.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
