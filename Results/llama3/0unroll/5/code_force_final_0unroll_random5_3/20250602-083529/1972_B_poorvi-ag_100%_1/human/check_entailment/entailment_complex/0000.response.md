Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The program correctly reads the input, processes it, and produces the expected output.

The key insight in this problem is that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win. The program uses the fact that if the number of "U"s in the string is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of "U"s, and Bob can never make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of "U"s.

The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of "U"s in each string and outputting "yes" if it's odd and "no" if it's even.

Correctness: **True**
