Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and 2n integers. The function sorts the 2n integers, selects the smallest n integers, calculates their sum, and stores the sum in a list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the sums of the smallest n integers for each test case. The function does not modify the input variables and does not have any side effects other than printing the output.**
