Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program reads the correct number of inputs: It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and `2n` integers.

2. The program sorts the integers: It sorts the `2n` integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the smallest `n` integers.

3. The program selects the smallest `n` integers: It selects the smallest `n` integers from the sorted list, which is done by iterating over the sorted list and selecting every other integer starting from the first one.

4. The program calculates the sum of the smallest `n` integers: It calculates the sum of the selected integers, which is the maximum final score that can be achieved.

5. The program prints the correct output: It prints the sum of the smallest `n` integers for each test case, which is the expected output.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output without modifying the input variables or having any side effects other than printing the output.

Correctness: **True**
