Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of integers written on the whiteboard (2n) and the integers themselves.
2. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the minimum of each pair.
3. It then iterates over the sorted list, selecting the minimum of each pair (i.e., the first element of each pair) and adds it to the score.
4. The program repeats this process for each test case and prints the maximum final score for each case.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When there is only one pair of integers (n=1), it correctly selects the minimum of the pair.
* When there are multiple pairs of integers (n>1), it correctly selects the minimum of each pair and adds it to the score.
* When all integers are the same, it correctly adds the same value to the score for each pair.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
