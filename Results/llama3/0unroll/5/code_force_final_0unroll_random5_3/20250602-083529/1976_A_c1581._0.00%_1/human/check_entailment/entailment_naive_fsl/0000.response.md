Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem description. It checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if there are no digits after letters, if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, and if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program uses two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to separate the digits and letters in the password. It then checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing them with their sorted versions. It also checks if there are any digits after letters by keeping track of the last digit index and checking if any letters appear after it.

The program correctly handles the case where the password has only letters or only digits, as well as the case where the password has a mix of letters and digits. It also correctly handles the case where the password has repeated letters or digits.

Overall, the program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password and should work correctly for all possible inputs.
