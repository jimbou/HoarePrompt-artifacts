Output State: **The digits list contains all the digits from the password string, the letters list contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the password string, and last_digit_index is -1.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `last_digit_index` and assigned it the value -1. The values of the other variables, `digits` and `letters`, remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The `digits` list still contains all the digits from the password string, and the `letters` list still contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the password string.
