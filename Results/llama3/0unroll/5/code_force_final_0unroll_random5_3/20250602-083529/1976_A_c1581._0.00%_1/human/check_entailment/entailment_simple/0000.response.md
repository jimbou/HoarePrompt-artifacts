Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program first separates the input password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done correctly using a for loop that iterates over each character in the password and checks if it's a digit or a letter using the `isdigit()` method.

2.  Next, the program checks if there are any digits that come after a letter in the password. This is done by iterating over the password and keeping track of the index of the last digit encountered. If a letter is encountered after a digit, the program immediately returns 'NO'.

3.  After that, the program checks if the digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If the lists are not equal, the program returns 'NO'.

4.  Similarly, the program checks if the letters in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is done by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If the lists are not equal, the program returns 'NO'.

5.  If the program passes all the above checks, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

Correctness: **True**
