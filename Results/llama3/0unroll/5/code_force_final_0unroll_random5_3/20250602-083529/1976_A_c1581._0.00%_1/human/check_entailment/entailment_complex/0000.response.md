Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly separates the password into digits and letters, which is necessary to check the conditions.
2. It checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and keeping track of the last digit index. If it finds a letter after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'.
3. It checks if the digits are sorted in ascending order by comparing the digits list with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.
4. It checks if the letters are sorted in ascending order by comparing the letters list with its sorted version. If they are not equal, it returns 'NO'.
5. If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description, and the execution states provided as comments confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
