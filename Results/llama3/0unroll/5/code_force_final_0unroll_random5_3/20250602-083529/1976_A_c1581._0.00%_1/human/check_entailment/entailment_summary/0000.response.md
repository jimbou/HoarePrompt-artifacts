Reasoning: 

The provided program is correct. It accurately checks if a given password string meets the conditions specified in the problem description. The program correctly separates the password into digits and letters, checks if the digits are in ascending order, checks if the letters are in ascending order, and checks if all digits come before all letters. If any of these conditions are not met, the program correctly returns 'NO'. If all conditions are met, the program correctly returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
