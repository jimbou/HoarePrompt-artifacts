Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to find any simple cycle in the graph where the weight of the lightest edge is minimal. However, the program does not correctly identify the lightest edge in the cycle.

In the function `func_6()`, the program sorts the edges in descending order of their weights and then iterates over them. For each edge, it checks if the two vertices of the edge are in the same connected component using the `DSU` data structure. If they are, it updates the minimum edge weight and the corresponding vertices. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the minimum edge weight is part of a simple cycle.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:

5
6 6
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 4 1

In this example, the program will output `1 3` and `1 2 3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1 4` and `1 4 3 2`.

The reason for this error is that the program does not correctly identify the lightest edge in the cycle. In this example, the lightest edge is `1 4` with weight `1`, but the program outputs `1 2` with weight `1` which is not part of a simple cycle.

To fix this error, the program needs to be modified to correctly identify the lightest edge in the cycle. One possible approach is to use a depth-first search (DFS) to find all simple cycles in the graph and then select the cycle with the lightest edge.
