Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph with the minimum edge weight. The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific task.

Function 1-5 are input functions that read integers, strings, or lists of integers from standard input.

Function 6 is the main function that constructs a graph from a set of edges, finds the minimum edge in the graph using a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure, and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes that form the minimum edge.

Function 7 is a helper function that performs the DFS in the graph to find a path that includes a specific vertex (node_v).

Function 8 is the main execution function that executes a loop a specified number of times, invoking function 6 in each iteration.

Based on the execution summaries, the program correctly implements the following steps:

1. Reads the number of test cases and the number of edges and vertices in each test case.
2. Constructs a graph from the edges and finds the minimum edge using a DSU data structure.
3. Performs a DFS starting from one of the nodes that form the minimum edge to find a simple cycle.
4. Prints the minimum edge value and the number of nodes in the cycle found by the DFS, and prints the nodes in the cycle.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
