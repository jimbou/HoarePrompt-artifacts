Output State: The output state is the same as the initial state, as the loop does not modify any variables. The loop iterates `test_cases` times, but since `func_6()` is not defined, its behavior is unknown. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `test_cases` still being the value returned by `func_1()`.
