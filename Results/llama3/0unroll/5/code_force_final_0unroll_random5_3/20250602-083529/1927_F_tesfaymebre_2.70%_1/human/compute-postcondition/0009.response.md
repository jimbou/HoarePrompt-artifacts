The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, which is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u` and an empty list.

Since the exact `dfs` function and its behavior are not provided, we can't determine the exact elements of the `res` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `res` list.

Output: **elements of the result of the dfs function called with node_u and an empty list**
