#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs a graph from a set of edges, finds the minimum edge in the graph using a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure, and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes that form the minimum edge. The function returns the minimum edge value and the number of nodes in the cycle found by the DFS, and prints the nodes in the cycle.

    #State: The loop iterates over all neighbors of the current vertex (curr) in the graph. For each neighbor (nei), it checks if the color of the neighbor is not 2 (i.e., it's not visited before) and if the neighbor is not the parent vertex. If both conditions are true, it calls the dfs function recursively with the neighbor as the new current vertex, the current vertex as the parent, and the updated path. The dfs function returns a list of vertices. If the returned list is not empty and contains the specific vertex (node_v), the function returns this list. If the loop completes all iterations without finding a path that includes the specific vertex, the function does not return anything (i.e., it returns None).

    #The program returns an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) in a graph to find a path that includes a specific vertex (node_v). It accepts parameters representing the current vertex (curr), its parent vertex (parent), the current path, the colors of vertices, the graph structure, and the specific vertex to search for. The function returns a list of vertices representing the path found, or an empty list if no path is found. The function modifies the colors of vertices in the graph during the search, marking them as visited.

    #State: The state of the program after the loop has finished executing is unknown, as the behavior of `func_6()` is not specified. However, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:Executes a loop a specified number of times, invoking another function (`func_6`) in each iteration, without modifying the number of test cases.
