Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: curr and parent are integers representing vertices in a graph, path is a list of integers representing vertices in a graph and includes the current vertex, colors is a list of integers where colors[i] represents the color of vertex i and the color of the current vertex is 1, graph is a list of lists where graph[i] represents the neighbors of vertex i, and node_v is an integer representing a specific vertex in the graph.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
