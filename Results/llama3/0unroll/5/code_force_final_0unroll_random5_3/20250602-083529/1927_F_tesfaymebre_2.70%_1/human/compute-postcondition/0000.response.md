Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`, which is unknown since the function's behavior is not specified**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` is updated to be the result of calling the function `func_1()`. However, since the behavior of `func_1()` is not specified, the exact value of `test_cases` is unknown. The initial state of `test_cases` being a non-negative integer is no longer applicable, as its value is now determined by the function call.
