Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

The node_u and node_v variables have been updated to reflect the nodes that form the minimum edge. The colors and res variables remain unchanged.

    print(*res)
    #This is printed: elements of the result of the dfs function called with node_u and an empty list

#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs a graph from a set of edges, finds the minimum edge in the graph using a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure, and then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes that form the minimum edge. The function returns the minimum edge value and the number of nodes in the cycle found by the DFS, and prints the nodes in the cycle.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr and parent are integers representing vertices in a graph, path is a list of integers representing vertices in a graph, colors is a list of integers where colors[i] represents the color of vertex i, graph is a list of lists where graph[i] represents the neighbors of vertex i, and node_v is an integer representing a specific vertex in the graph.

                return res
        
    #State: The loop iterates over all neighbors of the current vertex (curr) in the graph. For each neighbor (nei), it checks if the color of the neighbor is not 2 (i.e., it's not visited before) and if the neighbor is not the parent vertex. If both conditions are true, it calls the dfs function recursively with the neighbor as the new current vertex, the current vertex as the parent, and the updated path. The dfs function returns a list of vertices. If the returned list is not empty and contains the specific vertex (node_v), the function returns this list. If the loop completes all iterations without finding a path that includes the specific vertex, the function does not return anything (i.e., it returns None).
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) in a graph to find a path that includes a specific vertex (node_v). It accepts parameters representing the current vertex (curr), its parent vertex (parent), the current path, the colors of vertices, the graph structure, and the specific vertex to search for. The function returns a list of vertices representing the path found, or an empty list if no path is found. The function modifies the colors of vertices in the graph during the search, marking them as visited.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a non-negative integer
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: The state of the program after the loop has finished executing is unknown, as the behavior of `func_6()` is not specified. However, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:Executes a loop a specified number of times, invoking another function (`func_6`) in each iteration, without modifying the number of test cases.
