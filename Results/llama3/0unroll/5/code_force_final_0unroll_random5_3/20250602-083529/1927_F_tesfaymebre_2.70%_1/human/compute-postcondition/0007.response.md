Functionality: **This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) in a graph to find a path that includes a specific vertex (node_v). It accepts parameters representing the current vertex (curr), its parent vertex (parent), the current path, the colors of vertices, the graph structure, and the specific vertex to search for. The function returns a list of vertices representing the path found, or an empty list if no path is found. The function modifies the colors of vertices in the graph during the search, marking them as visited.**
