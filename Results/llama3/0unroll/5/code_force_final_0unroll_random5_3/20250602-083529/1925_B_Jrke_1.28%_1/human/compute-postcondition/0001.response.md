Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers x and n. For each test case, it calculates the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the integer division of x by n, and prints this value. The function repeats this process for each test case, producing a series of output integers equal in number to the initial test case count.**
