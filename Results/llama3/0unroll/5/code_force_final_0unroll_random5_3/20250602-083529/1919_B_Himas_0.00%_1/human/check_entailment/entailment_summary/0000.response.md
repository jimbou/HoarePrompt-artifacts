Reasoning: 
The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, which represents the sum of the array. This is equivalent to calculating the penalty for the entire array as a single subarray. 

However, the problem statement allows for splitting the array into multiple subarrays, and the penalty is calculated for each subarray separately. The program does not consider this and always treats the entire array as a single subarray.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible ways to split the array into subarrays, which is a crucial part of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
