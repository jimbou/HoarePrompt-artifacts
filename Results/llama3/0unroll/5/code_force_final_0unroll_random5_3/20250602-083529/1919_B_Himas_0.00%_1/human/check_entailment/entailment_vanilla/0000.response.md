Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func` that reads the number of test cases, the length of the string, and the string itself. It then initializes two variables, `P` and `M`, to 0. These variables are used to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.

The program then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '+', it increments `P` by 1. If the character is '-', it increments `M` by 1.

Finally, the program prints the difference between `P` and `M`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The reasoning behind this program is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays that have a sum of 0. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so a subarray with a sum of 0 has a penalty of 0.

By counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, the program can determine the minimum possible penalty. If there are more '+' characters than '-' characters, the minimum possible penalty is the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters. If there are more '-' characters than '+' characters, the minimum possible penalty is the difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty.
