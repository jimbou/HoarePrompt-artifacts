Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, which represents the sum of the array. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the length of the subarrays.

The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of the array and then find the minimum possible penalty by considering all possible ways to split the array into subarrays. This can be done using dynamic programming.

However, the given program is actually correct. The key insight is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays of length 1, except when the sum of the array is 0, in which case the minimum possible penalty is 0. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the sum of the array is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
