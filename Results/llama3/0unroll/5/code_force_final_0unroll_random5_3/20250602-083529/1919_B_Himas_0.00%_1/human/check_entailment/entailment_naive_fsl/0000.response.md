Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty. The problem description states that the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. However, the program simply prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct calculation.

For example, consider the input string "++--". The program would output 0, but the correct output should be 4, because the optimal split is ([1, 1], [-1, -1]) and the penalty is |1+1|*2 + |-1-1|*2 = 4.

The program does not take into account the length of the subarrays, which is a crucial part of the penalty calculation. Therefore, it is incorrect.
