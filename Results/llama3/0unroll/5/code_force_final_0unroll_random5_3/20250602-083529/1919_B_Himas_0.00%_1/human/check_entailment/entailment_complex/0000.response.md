Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string, which represents the sum of the array. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to find the optimal way to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. This can be done by using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques.

However, the given program is actually correct. The reason is that the problem can be solved by simply calculating the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to split it into subarrays of length 1, each containing either a '+' or a '-' character. The penalty for each subarray is then simply the absolute value of its sum, which is 1 for '+' characters and -1 for '-' characters. Therefore, the total penalty is simply the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
