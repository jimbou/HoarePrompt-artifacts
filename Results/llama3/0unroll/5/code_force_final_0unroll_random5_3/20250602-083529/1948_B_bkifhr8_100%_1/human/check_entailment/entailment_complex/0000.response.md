Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero).

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements `arr`.
3.  It initializes a variable `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.
4.  The program then iterates over the array in reverse order (from the second last element to the first element).
5.  For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If this condition is true, it means that the array is not sorted.
6.  In this case, the program attempts to "split" the previous element into its digits and inserts them in the correct order. It does this by converting the previous element to a string, splitting it into individual digits, and then comparing these digits with the current element.
7.  If the resulting array of digits and the current element is not sorted, the program sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
8.  After processing all pairs of adjacent elements, the program prints 'YES' if `ans` is still `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

Correctness: **True**
