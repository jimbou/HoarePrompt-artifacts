The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99). The first integer t is accepted and assigned to `n`. So, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).**
