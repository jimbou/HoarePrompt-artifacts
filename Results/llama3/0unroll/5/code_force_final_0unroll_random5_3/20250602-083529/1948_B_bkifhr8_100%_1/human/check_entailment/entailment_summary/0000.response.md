Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order by rearranging the digits of its elements. The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous one. If it is, the program splits the previous element into its digits, combines them with the current element, and checks if the resulting list is sorted. If it is not, the program sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it updates the previous element with the first digit of the sorted list. Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
