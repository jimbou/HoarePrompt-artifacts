Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order, but it is possible to make it sorted by splitting some elements. For example, consider the array [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will return 'NO' because it checks if the array is sorted in reverse order, but it does not consider the possibility of splitting elements to make the array sorted.

In this case, the correct output should be 'YES' because we can split the first element '12' into '1' and '2', and the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] which is sorted in non-decreasing order.
