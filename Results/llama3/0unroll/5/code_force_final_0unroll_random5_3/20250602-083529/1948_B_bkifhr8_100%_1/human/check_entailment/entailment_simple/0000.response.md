Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It iterates through the array from right to left, checking if the current element is less than the previous one. If it is, it splits the previous element into its digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. If it's not, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. If the loop completes without finding any unsorted arrays, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and handles all possible cases. It also uses a efficient approach by iterating through the array only once and using a flag to track the answer.

Correctness: **True**
