Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

The code reads an integer t from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). After this line, stdin contains t lines, each with three integers a, b, and m, all between 1 and 10^18 (inclusive). No other variables are affected by this line.
