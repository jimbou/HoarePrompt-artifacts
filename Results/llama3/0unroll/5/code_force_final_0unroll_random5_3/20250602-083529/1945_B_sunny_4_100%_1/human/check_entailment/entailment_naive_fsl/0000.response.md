Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The issue lies in the line `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. The addition of 2 is incorrect and does not account for the actual number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

A correct approach would be to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation separately and then add them together. This can be done by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b) and adding 1 to account for the firework that is launched at time 0.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = m // a + 1 + m // b + 1
        print(ans)
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by adding 1 to the result of the division for each installation, which accounts for the firework that is launched at time 0.
