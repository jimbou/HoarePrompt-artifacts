Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program reads a series of input lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m, which represent the frequency of launching for the first installation, the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky, respectively.

The program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by adding the integer divisions of m by a and b, plus 2. This is based on the fact that the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time is the sum of the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation within the time period m, plus 2 (since the first firework from each installation is visible for m+1 minutes).

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
