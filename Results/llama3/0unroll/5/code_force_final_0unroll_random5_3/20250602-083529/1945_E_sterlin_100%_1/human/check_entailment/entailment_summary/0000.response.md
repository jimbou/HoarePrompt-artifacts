Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves finding a number x in a permutation p of size n using a modified binary search algorithm. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation n and the number to be found x. It then reads the permutation p.

The program uses a dictionary num_indx to store the indices of the numbers in the permutation, and a list seen to keep track of the numbers that have been seen during the binary search.

The binary search is performed by maintaining two pointers, left and right, which are initialized to 0 and n, respectively. The loop continues until left + 1 is no longer less than right. In each iteration, the mid index is calculated, and the number at the mid index is marked as seen. If the number at the mid index is less than or equal to x, the left pointer is updated to mid; otherwise, the right pointer is updated to mid.

After the binary search, the program checks if the number at the left index is equal to x. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no operations are needed. If the number at the left index is not equal to x and x has not been seen during the binary search, the program prints 1 and the indices of the left index and the index of x in the permutation.

If the number at the left index is not equal to x and x has been seen during the binary search, the program prints 2 and the indices of the left index and the index of x in the permutation, and then the indices of the left index and the index of the first unseen number in the permutation.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
