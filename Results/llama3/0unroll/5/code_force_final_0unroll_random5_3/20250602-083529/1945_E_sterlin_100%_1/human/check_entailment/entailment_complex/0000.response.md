Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It uses a binary search algorithm to find the position of a given number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n`. The program first creates a dictionary `num_indx` to store the indices of the numbers in the permutation. It then initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the permutation, respectively. The program then enters a loop where it calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range `[left, right]` and checks if the number at the midpoint is less than or equal to `x`. If it is, the program updates `left` to `mid`; otherwise, it updates `right` to `mid`. The loop continues until `left + 1` is no longer less than `right`.

After the loop, the program checks if the number at the `left` index is equal to `x`. If it is, the program prints `0` and ends. If not, the program checks if the number `x` has been seen before (i.e., its index is in the `seen` list). If it has not been seen, the program prints `1` and the indices of `x` and the number at the `left` index. If `x` has been seen, the program prints `2` and the indices of the first unseen number, `x`, and the number at the `left` index.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
