Output State: **The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string in stdin.**

In this output state, the list contains strings of any type and value, as the input string in stdin can contain any type of value. The list is created by splitting the input string at each space character, resulting in a list of substrings. Each substring is a string representation of the original value from the input string.
