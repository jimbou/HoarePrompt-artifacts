Correctness: **False**.

The program does not implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem description. The binary search algorithm requires the array to be sorted, but the program does not sort the array before performing the binary search. Additionally, the program does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that the element at index `l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

A counterexample is the input:

```
5
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The program should output:

```
0
```

But the program does not perform any swaps, and the binary search will not find the element `3` at index `l`.

Note that the program is incomplete and does not implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem description.
