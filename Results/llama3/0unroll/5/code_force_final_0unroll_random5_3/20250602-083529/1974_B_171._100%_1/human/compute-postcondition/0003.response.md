Output State: **`decoded` is a string where each character is the character from `unique_chars` that is the same distance from the end of `unique_chars` as the corresponding character in `encoded` is from the start of `unique_chars`, `char_map` is a dictionary where each key-value pair contains a character from `unique_chars` as the key and the character from `unique_chars` that is the same distance from the end of `unique_chars` as the key is from the start of `unique_chars` as the value.**

In this output state, the value of `decoded` is calculated by iterating over each character `ch` in `encoded` and replacing it with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` that is the same distance from the end of `unique_chars` as `ch` is from the start of `unique_chars`. This is done using the `char_map` dictionary, which remains unchanged. The resulting string is assigned to the variable `decoded`.
