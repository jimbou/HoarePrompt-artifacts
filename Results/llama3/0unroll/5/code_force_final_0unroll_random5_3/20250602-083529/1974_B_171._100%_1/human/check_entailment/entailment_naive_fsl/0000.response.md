Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings themselves `b`.

2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program creates a set of unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order. This is done using the `sorted(set(encoded))` expression, which produces a list of unique characters in sorted order.

4. The program then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character to its symmetric character in the sorted list. This is done using a loop that iterates over the indices of the sorted list and assigns each character to its corresponding symmetric character.

5. The program then uses a generator expression to iterate over each character `ch` in the encoded string `b` and replaces it with its symmetric character using the `char_map` dictionary. The resulting decoded string is then returned.

6. The program appends the decoded string to a list of results and prints each result after processing all test cases.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm by:

* Creating a set of unique characters in the encoded string and sorting them in alphabetical order.
* Mapping each unique character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
* Replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character using the `char_map` dictionary.

The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
