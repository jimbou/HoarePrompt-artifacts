Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from encoded in alphabetical order, char_map is an empty dictionary, len_unique is the number of unique characters in encoded.**

In this final state, the value of `encoded` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `unique_chars` variable now holds a list of unique characters from the `encoded` string, sorted in alphabetical order. The `char_map` variable is an empty dictionary, ready to be populated with character mappings. The `len_unique` variable stores the number of unique characters in the `encoded` string, which is the length of the `unique_chars` list.
