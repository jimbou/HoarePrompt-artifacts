#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: char_map is a dictionary where each key-value pair contains a character from unique_chars as the key and the character from unique_chars that is the same distance from the end of unique_chars as the key is from the start of unique_chars as the value.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string 'decoded' where each character is the character from 'unique_chars' that is the same distance from the end of 'unique_chars' as the corresponding character in 'encoded' is from the start of 'unique_chars'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reverses the order of unique characters in a given string while maintaining their original frequency and position, returning the modified string.
