Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the auxiliary string `r` consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order.

2. The program then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each key-value pair contains a character from `unique_chars` as the key and the character from `unique_chars` that is the same distance from the end of `unique_chars` as the key is from the start of `unique_chars` as the value. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`.

3. Finally, the program uses the `char_map` dictionary to decode the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the decoding process involves replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from the string `r`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement, and therefore, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
