Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a given string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by reading the input data, which includes the number of test cases (`t`) and the encoded strings (`b`) for each test case.
2.  It defines a function `func_1` that takes an encoded string (`encoded`) as input and returns the decoded string.
3.  Inside `func_1`, it first finds the unique characters in the encoded string using `set(encoded)` and sorts them in alphabetical order using `sorted()`. This gives the auxiliary string `r` mentioned in the problem description.
4.  It then creates a character mapping (`char_map`) where each character in the auxiliary string `r` is mapped to its symmetric character. This is done by iterating over the indices of the unique characters and mapping each character to the character at the corresponding index from the end of the list.
5.  Finally, it uses a generator expression to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character using the `char_map`. The decoded characters are joined together to form the decoded string, which is returned as the result.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
