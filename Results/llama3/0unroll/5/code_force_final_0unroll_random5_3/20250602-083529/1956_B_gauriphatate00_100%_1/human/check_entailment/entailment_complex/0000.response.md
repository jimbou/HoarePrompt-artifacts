Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the list `a` and stores it in the dictionary `count_a`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the count of each number is 2. If it is, it increments the `max_score` by 1. Finally, it returns the `max_score`, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored.

The program correctly handles the case where a number appears exactly twice in the list `a`, and it correctly ignores the numbers that appear only once. The program also correctly assumes that the input list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n` and that each integer appears at most twice.

Correctness: **True**
