Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

The program first creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if each integer is present in the dictionary `count_a`. If an integer is present and its count is 2, it means that the player has two cards with that integer, and therefore can score a point by playing one of them. The program increments the `max_score` variable by 1 for each such integer.

The program returns the `max_score` variable, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the input list `a` contains only unique integers, in which case the `max_score` will be 0.
* When the input list `a` contains duplicate integers, in which case the `max_score` will be incremented for each duplicate integer.
* When the input list `a` contains integers that are not present in the range from 1 to `n`, in which case they will be ignored by the program.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and correctly handles all possible cases.
