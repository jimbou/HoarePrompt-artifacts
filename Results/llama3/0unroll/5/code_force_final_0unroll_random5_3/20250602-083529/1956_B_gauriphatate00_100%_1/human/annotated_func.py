#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and the length of a is equal to n. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the list a at most 2 times.
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: `count_a` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from 1 through `n` and the values are the counts of each integer in the list `a`. The length of `a` is still equal to `n`.

    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                max_score += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `max_score` is the number of integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice, and `count_a` remains unchanged.
    return max_score
    #The program returns the number of integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice, and `count_a` remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers `a` and a positive integer `n` as input, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list at most twice. It returns the number of integers in the list that appear exactly twice, without modifying the original list.
