Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and the length of `a` is equal to `n`. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. `count_a` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `n` remain the same as in the initial state, and `count_a` is a new variable that is initialized as an empty dictionary.
