Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` and a positive integer `n` as input, where `n` is the length of the list `a` and each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list at most twice. It returns the number of integers in the list that appear exactly twice, which is the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

The program works by first creating a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if each integer appears exactly twice in the list. If an integer appears exactly twice, it increments the `max_score` by 1. Finally, it returns the `max_score`, which is the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

The execution summary is also correct, as it describes the behavior of the function accurately.

Correctness: **True**
