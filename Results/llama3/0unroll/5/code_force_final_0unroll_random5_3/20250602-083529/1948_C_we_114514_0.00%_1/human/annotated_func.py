    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a tuple of two elements: an even positive integer `n` and a tuple of two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the second row is reachable from the first row for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the second row is reachable from the first row for each test case in the list of test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function determines the reachability of the second row from the first row for each test case in the provided list of test cases and returns a list of strings indicating whether the second row is reachable ('YES') or not ('NO') for each test case.
