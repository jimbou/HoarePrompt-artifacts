Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a tuple of two elements: an even positive integer `n` and a tuple of two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `results` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables, `t` and `test_cases`, remain unchanged. The `test_cases` list still contains tuples of two elements: an even positive integer `n` and a tuple of two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters.
