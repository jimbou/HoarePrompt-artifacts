Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `frequency_table` which is an empty dictionary. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged, and the length of `arr` is still between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
