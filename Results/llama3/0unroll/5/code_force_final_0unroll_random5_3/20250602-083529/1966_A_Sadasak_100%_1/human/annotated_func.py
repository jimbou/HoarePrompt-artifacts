#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100 and the length of arr is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1

    #State: Output State: `frequency_table` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `arr` and the values are the frequencies of these integers in `arr`, capped at `k`.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `arr` and the values are the frequencies of these integers in `arr`, capped at `k`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, capping the frequency of each integer at a specified value k. It takes a list of integers and an integer k as input, and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in the list and the values are their frequencies, limited to a maximum of k.
