Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order and then iterates over the list in steps of 2, adding the smaller of each pair of integers to the score. This approach ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1 or where all integers are the same. The use of the `split()` function to convert the input string into a list of integers is also correct.

Overall, the program is well-structured and correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
