Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program attempts to solve this problem by considering two cases:

1. `k >= 2`: In this case, the program checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints an array of `k` elements, all equal to `k`. This is because an array of identical elements is sorted, and its cyclic shifts are also sorted. If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`, indicating that no such array exists.

2. `k < 2`: In this case, the program prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is one more than its index. This array is sorted, and its only sorted cyclic shift is the original array itself.

However, there are some issues with the program:

* In the first case, when `n == k`, the program prints an array of `k` elements, but it should print an array of `n` elements.
* In the second case, the program prints an array of `n` elements, but it does not consider the case where `k == 0`. In this case, the program should print an array that has no sorted cyclic shifts.

Despite these issues, the program is correct for the given problem description. The problem statement guarantees that `1 <= k <= n`, so the case `k == 0` is not possible. Additionally, the program's output for the case `n == k` is actually correct, because an array of identical elements is sorted, and its cyclic shifts are also sorted.

Correctness: **True**
