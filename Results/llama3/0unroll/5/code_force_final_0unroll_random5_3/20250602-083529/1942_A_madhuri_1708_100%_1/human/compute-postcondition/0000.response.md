Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing a sequence of integers. If k is 1, the sequence will be a list of consecutive integers from 1 to n. If k is greater than 1, the sequence will either be a list of k repeated k times (if n equals k), or the string '-1' (if n is greater than k).**
