Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of n and k from the input.

If k is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints a list of k repeated k times, which satisfies the condition of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. If n is greater than k, it prints '-1', indicating that no such array exists.

If k is 1, the program prints a list of consecutive integers from 1 to n. This is because any array with distinct elements will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
