Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = 1 and n > 1. In this case, the program prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, which is not a valid solution because it does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints "1 2 3", but this sequence has 3 sorted cyclic shifts ([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], and [3, 1, 2]), not 1.

A correct solution for this case would be to print a sequence where only one cyclic shift is sorted, such as "69420 69 420" as shown in the example output.
