Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k.
2. For each test case, the program checks if k is 1. If k is 1, it prints a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly k (i.e., 1) of the cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
3. If k is greater than 1, the program checks if n equals k. If n equals k, it prints a sequence of k repeated k times, which satisfies the condition that exactly k of the cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
4. If k is greater than 1 and n is greater than k, the program prints '-1', indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
