Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, if k is 1, it prints a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to n. If k is greater than 1, it either prints a sequence of k repeated k times (if n equals k) or prints '-1' (if n is greater than k). The function outputs the results for all test cases, with each result on a separate line.**
