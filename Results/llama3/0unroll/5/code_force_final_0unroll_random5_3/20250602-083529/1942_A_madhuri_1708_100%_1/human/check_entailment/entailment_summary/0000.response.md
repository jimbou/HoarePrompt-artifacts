Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the two cases described in the problem statement:

1.  If k is 1, it prints a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted.
2.  If k is greater than 1, it checks if n equals k. If they are equal, it prints a sequence of k repeated k times, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the array are sorted. If n is greater than k, it prints '-1', indicating that there is no valid array.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required behavior based on the values of n and k.

Correctness: **True**
