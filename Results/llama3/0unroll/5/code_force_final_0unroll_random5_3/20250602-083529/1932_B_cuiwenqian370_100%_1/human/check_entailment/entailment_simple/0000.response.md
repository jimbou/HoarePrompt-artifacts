Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The program reads the input from the standard input, processes the test cases, and writes the results to the standard output.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read()`. It splits the input into a list of strings using the `split()` method and initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the list.
2.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` from the input and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results of each test case.
3.  For each test case, the program correctly reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` from the input. It initializes the `last_year` variable to the periodicity of the first sign `a_0`.
4.  The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur by iterating through the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year by adding 1 to the last year, dividing by the periodicity of the current sign, rounding up to the nearest integer, and multiplying by the periodicity of the current sign. This ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the last year.
5.  The program correctly appends the result of each test case to the `results` list as a string.
6.  Finally, the program correctly writes the results to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`.

Based on the above analysis, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
