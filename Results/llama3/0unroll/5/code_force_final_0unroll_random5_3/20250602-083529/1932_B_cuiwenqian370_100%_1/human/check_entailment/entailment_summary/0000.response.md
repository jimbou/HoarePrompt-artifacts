Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program reads input from standard input, processes it, and writes the results to standard output.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the year of the n-th sign. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, calculates the next year for each sign based on the previous year and the sign's periodicity, and updates the last year accordingly.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, the number of signs in each test case, and the periodicities of the signs. It then writes the results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program behaves as expected. It processes the input, calculates the results, and writes them to standard output without any errors.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
