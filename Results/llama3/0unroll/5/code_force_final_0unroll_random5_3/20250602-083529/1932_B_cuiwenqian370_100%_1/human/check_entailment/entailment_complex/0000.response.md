Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The program reads input from standard input, processes it, and writes the results to standard output.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the last year of each test case. It initializes the last year to the periodicity of the first sign, and then iterates over the remaining signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year by adding 1 to the last year, dividing by the periodicity of the current sign, rounding up to the nearest integer, and multiplying by the periodicity of the current sign. This ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of the periodicity of the current sign that is greater than the last year.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the input from standard input, splits it into test cases, and processes each test case separately. It stores the results in a list and writes them to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
