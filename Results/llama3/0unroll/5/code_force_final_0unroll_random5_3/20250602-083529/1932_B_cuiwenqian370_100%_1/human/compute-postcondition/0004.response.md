Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and writes the results to standard output. It expects the input to contain an integer T (1 <= T <= 1000) followed by T test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The function processes each test case, calculates the last year of the test case, and stores the results in a list. Finally, it writes the results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character. The function does not return any value.**
