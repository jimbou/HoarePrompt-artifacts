Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of signs, calculating the year in which each sign will occur based on the previous sign's year and the periodicity of the current sign. The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next sign occurs in the first year that is a multiple of its periodicity and is greater than the previous sign's year.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the periodicity of a sign is 1 (in which case the sign occurs every year) and where the periodicity of a sign is greater than the previous sign's year (in which case the sign occurs in the first year that is a multiple of its periodicity and is greater than the previous sign's year).

The program also correctly handles the input and output, reading the number of test cases and the signs' periodicities from the input and writing the results to the output.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
