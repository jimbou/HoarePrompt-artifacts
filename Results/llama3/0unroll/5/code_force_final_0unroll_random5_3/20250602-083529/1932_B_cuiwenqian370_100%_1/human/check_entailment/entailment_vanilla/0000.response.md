Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The signs must occur sequentially, and the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence of the (i+1)-th sign, starting from the year x+1, where x is the year the i-th sign occurred.

2. The given program reads the input data, including the number of test cases (T), the number of signs (n), and the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

3. For each test case, the program initializes the last_year variable to the periodicity of the first sign (a[0]). Then, it iterates over the remaining signs (from the second sign to the n-th sign).

4. In each iteration, the program calculates the next_year by finding the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity (a[i]) that is greater than the last_year. This is done using the formula (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i], which effectively rounds up the last_year to the nearest multiple of a[i].

5. The program then updates the last_year variable to the calculated next_year.

6. After iterating over all signs, the program appends the final last_year value to the results list.

7. Finally, the program writes the results to the standard output, one result per line.

Correctness: **True**
