Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is T + 1 + sum(n_i) where n_i is the number of integers in the i-th test case, results is a list of T strings where each string represents the last year of the i-th test case, data contains t test cases, each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, stdin is empty, and the output is the concatenation of all strings in results separated by newline characters, followed by a newline character.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the program has written the results to the standard output. The results are the concatenation of all strings in the results list, separated by newline characters, and followed by a newline character. The values of T, index, results, and data remain unchanged.
