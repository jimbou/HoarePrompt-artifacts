Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, nums is a list of integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple lines each containing two integers.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs to `n` and `q`, respectively. Since `n` is a positive integer, and `q` is a positive integer, their values are updated accordingly. The second line assigns a list of integers from the third input to `nums`. The third and fourth lines initialize `ones` and `sum` as lists of `n+1` zeros. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains multiple lines each containing two integers.
