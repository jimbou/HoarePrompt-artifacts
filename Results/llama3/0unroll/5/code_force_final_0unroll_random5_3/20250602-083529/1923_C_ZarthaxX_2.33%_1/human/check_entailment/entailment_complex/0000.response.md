Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given subarray is "good" based on certain conditions. The program first reads the input, calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the list minus the index, and then processes each query.

The key part of the program is the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, which checks if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array. This condition is derived from the problem statement and is correct.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `l == r` by printing 'NO' immediately. It also correctly calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the list minus the index.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
