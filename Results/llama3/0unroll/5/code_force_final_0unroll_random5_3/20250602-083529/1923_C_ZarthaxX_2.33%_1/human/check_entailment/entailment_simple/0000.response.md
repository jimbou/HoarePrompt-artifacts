Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not based on the given conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly initializes the `ones` and `sum` arrays to keep track of the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the input array `nums`, respectively.

2. The program correctly calculates the number of 1's and the sum of the subarray within the given range `[l, r]` using the `ones` and `sum` arrays.

3. The program correctly checks the conditions for a subarray to be good:
   - If `l == r`, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray is sufficient to make all elements greater than 1. This is done by comparing `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` (the minimum sum required to make all elements greater than 1) with `sumInRange` (the actual sum of the subarray). If the actual sum is greater than or equal to the minimum required sum, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether a subarray is good or not based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
