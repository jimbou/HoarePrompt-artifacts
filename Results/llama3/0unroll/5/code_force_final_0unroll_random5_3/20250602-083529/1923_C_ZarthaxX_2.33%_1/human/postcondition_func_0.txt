This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query. It first reads an integer n and q, then a list of n integers, and then q pairs of integers. It calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the list minus the index. For each query, it checks if a certain condition is met based on the calculated values and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input list or the calculated cumulative values.
