Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly initializes the `ones` and `sum` arrays to keep track of the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the input array minus the index, respectively.

2. For each query, the program correctly calculates the number of 1's and the sum of the subarray using the `ones` and `sum` arrays.

3. The program then checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is met. This condition is derived from the problem description and ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a good array.

4. If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
