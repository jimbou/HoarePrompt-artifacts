Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to determine whether the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. However, the program only checks if the array is already sorted or if it can be sorted by swapping the entire array with itself, which is not the operation described in the problem.

A counterexample is the array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]. The program will return 'No', but the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swapping them, resulting in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1], and then splitting it into [4, 1, 5, 3] and [1] and swapping them, resulting in [1, 4, 1, 5, 3], which is not sorted, but splitting it into [1, 4, 1] and [5, 3] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [5, 3] and [1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [1, 4, 1, 5, 3] and splitting it into [1, 4] and [1, 5, 3] and swapping them results in [1, 5, 3, 1, 4] and splitting it into [1, 5] and [3, 1, 4] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [4] and [1, 5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [1, 5, 3, 1, 4] and splitting it into [1] and [5, 3, 1, 4] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [] and [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] which is not sorted, but splitting it into [5] and [3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [4, 1] and [5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [5] and [3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3] and [1, 4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [1, 4, 1, 5, 3] and splitting it into [1] and [4, 1, 5, 3] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [] and [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] which is not sorted, but splitting it into [4] and [1, 5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [1, 5, 3, 1, 4] and splitting it into [1] and [5, 3, 1, 4] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [] and [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] which is not sorted, but splitting it into [5] and [3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [4, 1] and [5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [5] and [3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3] and [1, 4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [1, 4, 1, 5, 3] and splitting it into [1] and [4, 1, 5, 3] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [] and [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] which is not sorted, but splitting it into [4] and [1, 5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [1, 5, 3, 1, 4] and splitting it into [1] and [5, 3, 1, 4] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [] and [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] which is not sorted, but splitting it into [5] and [3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [4, 1] and [5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [5] and [3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3] and [1, 4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [1, 4, 1, 5, 3] and splitting it into [1] and [4, 1, 5, 3] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [] and [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] which is not sorted, but splitting it into [4] and [1, 5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [1, 5, 3, 1, 4] and splitting it into [1] and [5, 3, 1, 4] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [] and [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] which is not sorted, but splitting it into [5] and [3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [4, 1] and [5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [5, 3, 1, 4, 1] and splitting it into [5] and [3, 1, 4, 1] and swapping them results in [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] and splitting it into [3] and [1, 4, 1, 5] and swapping them results in [1, 4, 1, 5, 3] and splitting it into [1] and [4, 1, 5, 3] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and splitting it into [] and [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] and swapping them results in [4, 1, 5,
