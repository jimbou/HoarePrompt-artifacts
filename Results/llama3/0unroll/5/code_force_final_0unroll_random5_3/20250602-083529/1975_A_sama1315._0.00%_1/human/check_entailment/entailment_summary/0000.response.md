Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times. The provided functions do not directly address this problem.

Function 1 checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order, but it does not consider the possibility of swapping parts of the array to achieve non-decreasing order. Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results, but it relies on Function 1 to determine the sortedness of the array, which is not sufficient for the problem at hand.

The problem requires a more complex approach that considers all possible swaps of the array parts and checks if any of them result in a non-decreasing order. The provided functions do not meet this requirement.

Correctness: **False**
