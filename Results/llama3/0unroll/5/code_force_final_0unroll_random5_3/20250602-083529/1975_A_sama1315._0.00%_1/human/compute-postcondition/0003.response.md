The code prints a string that is the result of joining the elements of the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) in between each element. The `results` list contains the results of the `func_1(arr)` function for each iteration of the loop, where `arr` is a list of n positive integers and n is a positive integer.

Since the exact values of `t`, `n`, and the lists of positive integers are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `results` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the results of the `func_1(arr)` function for each iteration of the loop, separated by newline characters.

Output: **the results of func_1(arr) for each iteration of the loop, separated by newline characters (where arr is a list of n positive integers and n is a positive integer)**
