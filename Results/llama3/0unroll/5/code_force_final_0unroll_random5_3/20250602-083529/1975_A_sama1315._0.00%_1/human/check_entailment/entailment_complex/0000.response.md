Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some (possibly, zero) times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts â€” a prefix and a suffix, then swapping these two parts.

Function 1 checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order and returns 'Yes' if it is, or 'No' if it's not. However, this function does not consider the possibility of swapping the prefix and suffix of the array.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and lists of n positive integers. The function then iterates t times, each time processing a list of n positive integers using the func_1 function and storing the result.

However, Function 2 does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. It simply checks if the input array is already sorted in ascending order using Function 1, without considering the possibility of swapping the prefix and suffix.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check all possible swaps of the prefix and suffix of the array and verify if any of these swaps result in a sorted array. Since Function 2 does not do this, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
