Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer t, and the rest of the elements are alternating positive integers n and lists of n positive integers. The function then iterates t times, each time processing a list of n positive integers using the func_1 function and storing the result. Finally, it prints the results of all iterations, separated by newline characters.**
