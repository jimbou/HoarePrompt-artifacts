Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.

Function 1, `func_1`, checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns 'Yes'. If the array is not sorted, the function checks if there are any pairs of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

However, the given program is incorrect. The issue lies in `func_1`. The function only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are any pairs of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second. It does not consider the case where the array can be sorted by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.

For example, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` is not sorted, and there are no pairs of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second. However, the array can be sorted by splitting it into two parts `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]`, swapping them, and then splitting the resulting array `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]` into two parts `[9]` and `[2, 2, 3, 7]`, and swapping them again. The resulting array `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]` is sorted.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
