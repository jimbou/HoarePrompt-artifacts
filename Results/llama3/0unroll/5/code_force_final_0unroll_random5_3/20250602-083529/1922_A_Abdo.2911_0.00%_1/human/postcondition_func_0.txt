The function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints a series of 'YES' or 'NO' to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether, for each test case, strings 'a' and 'b' match a generated template and string 'c' does not match the template. The final state of the program is that the console contains a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs, one for each test case, indicating whether the condition was met for each case.
