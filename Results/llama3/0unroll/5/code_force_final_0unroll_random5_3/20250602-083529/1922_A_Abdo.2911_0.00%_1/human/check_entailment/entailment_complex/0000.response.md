Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It generates a template based on the strings a and b. If the characters at a particular position in a and b are the same, it adds the character to the template in lowercase. If the characters are different, it adds the character from a in uppercase to the template.
3. It checks if the strings a and b match the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
4. It checks if the string c does not match the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is different from the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.
5. Finally, it prints "YES" if the strings a and b match the template and the string c does not match the template, and "NO" otherwise.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
