Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that calculates the total cost. It initializes a variable `cost` to 0 and another variable `one` to 0. It then iterates over the string `s`. If it encounters a '1', it increments the `one` counter. If it encounters a '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it increments the `cost` by `one + 1`. This is because a '0' that is immediately preceded by at least one '1' requires a cyclic shift operation to move the '1's to the left of the '0'. The cost of this operation is equal to the number of '1's plus 1 (for the '0' itself).

The program then prints the result of `func_1(s)` for each test case.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the `func_1(s)` function.

Correctness: **True**
