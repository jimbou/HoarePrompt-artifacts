Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum total cost. The function iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of consecutive '1's encountered so far (`one`). Whenever a '0' is encountered and `one` is greater than 0, it means that the previous '1's need to be shifted to the right of the current '0'. The cost of this operation is `one + 1`, which is added to the total cost.

The program then reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and prints the result of calling `func_1` with `s` as input.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the need to shift '1's to the right of '0's and calculates the minimum cost of doing so. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
