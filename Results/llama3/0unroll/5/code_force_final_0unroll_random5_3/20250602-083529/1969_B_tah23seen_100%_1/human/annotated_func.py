#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) of length at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop has executed all iterations is that the variable 'one' will hold the count of consecutive '1's in the binary string 's' from the end of the string, and the variable 'cost' will hold the total count of '1's in the string 's' plus the count of '0's that are immediately preceded by at least one '1'. The binary string 's' remains unchanged.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total count of '1's in the binary string 's' plus the count of '0's that are immediately preceded by at least one '1'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the total count of '1's in a given binary string 's' plus the count of '0's that are immediately preceded by at least one '1', without modifying the input string.
