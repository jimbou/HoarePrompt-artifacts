Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. This is because the program is counting the number of '1's that need to be shifted to the end of the string, but it is not considering the case where a single '1' can be shifted to the end of the string in one operation.

In the given program, the function `func_1(s)` is not correctly implementing the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order. The function is only counting the number of '1's that need to be shifted to the end of the string, but it is not considering the actual cost of shifting these '1's.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of operations required to make the string sorted in non-descending order. This can be done by counting the number of '1's that need to be shifted to the end of the string and then finding the minimum cost to shift these '1's.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += 1
            one = 0
    if one > 0:
        cost += 1
    return cost
```

This corrected program correctly counts the minimum number of operations required to make the string sorted in non-descending order.
