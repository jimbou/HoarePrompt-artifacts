Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores calculated from the given permutation and array. The program handles all possible cases, including when both players start at the same position, when one player starts at a position with the maximum value in the array, and when neither player starts at a position with the maximum value in the array. The program also correctly calculates the scores for both players by simulating the game for k turns and considering the maximum score that can be achieved by each player.

Correctness: **True**
