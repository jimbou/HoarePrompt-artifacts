Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first checks if the maximum element in the array `a` is present at either `pb` or `ps` or both. If it is present at both, the program prints 'Draw'. If it is present at `pb`, the program prints 'Bodya'. If it is present at `ps`, the program prints 'Sasha'. This is correct because if the maximum element is present at either `pb` or `ps`, the corresponding player can stay at that position and win the game.

2. If the maximum element is not present at either `pb` or `ps`, the program simulates the game for `k` turns. It maintains two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha at each turn. The program also maintains two flags `foundb` and `founds` to check if Bodya or Sasha has reached the position with the maximum element.

3. After simulating the game for `k` turns, the program calculates the prefix sums of the scores of Bodya and Sasha. It then calculates the total score of each player for each possible number of turns.

4. Finally, the program compares the maximum total scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner accordingly.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and scenarios, and its logic is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
