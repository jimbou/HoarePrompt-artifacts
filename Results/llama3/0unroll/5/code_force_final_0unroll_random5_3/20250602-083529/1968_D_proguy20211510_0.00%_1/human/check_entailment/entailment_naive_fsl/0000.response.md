Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the maximum value in the array `a` is not unique, but there are multiple positions with the same maximum value. In this case, the program assumes that the player will always move to the position with the maximum value, but this is not necessarily the case. The player may choose to stay at their current position or move to a different position with the same maximum value.

For example, consider the input:

```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

In this case, the maximum value in the array `a` is 7, which is at positions 1 and 3. The program will assume that Bodya will move to position 1 and Sasha will move to position 3, but this is not necessarily the case. Bodya may choose to stay at position 3 and Sasha may choose to move to position 1. The program does not account for this possibility and will produce an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the correctness is **False**.
