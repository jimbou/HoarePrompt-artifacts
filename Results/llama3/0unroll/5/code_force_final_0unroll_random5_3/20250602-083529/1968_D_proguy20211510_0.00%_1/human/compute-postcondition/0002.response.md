Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their scores calculated from a given permutation and array. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four lines: the first line contains four space-separated integers (n, k, P_B, P_S), the second line contains n space-separated integers representing the permutation p, and the third line contains n space-separated integers representing the array a. The function then calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case.**
