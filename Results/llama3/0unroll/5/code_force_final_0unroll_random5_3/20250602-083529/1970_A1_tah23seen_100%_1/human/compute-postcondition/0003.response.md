Output State: **The string s remains unchanged, the integer n remains unchanged, the string ans remains empty, the dictionary d now maps each index i in the range from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) to the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring s[0..i], sorted by the difference in ascending order and then by the index in descending order.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet modifies the dictionary `d` by first removing the key-value pair with key `n`. This means that the dictionary `d` now only contains indices from 0 to `n-1`. Then, the dictionary is sorted by the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses in the substring `s[0..i]` in ascending order, and then by the index `i` in descending order. The string `s`, integer `n`, and string `ans` remain unchanged.
