Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the balanced shuffle of a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle is defined as the sequence obtained by sorting the columns of a table in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position.

2. The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the balanced shuffle of `s`.

3. Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `d` is created to store the prefix balance and position of each character in the input string. The prefix balance is calculated by iterating over the string and incrementing or decrementing the balance based on whether the character is an opening or closing parenthesis.

4. After calculating the prefix balance for each character, the dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance and position. The sorting is done in increasing order of prefix balance, and in case of a tie, the position is used as a tie-breaker in decreasing order.

5. Finally, the sorted dictionary is iterated over, and the characters at the corresponding positions in the original string are appended to the answer string `ans`.

6. The function returns the answer string `ans`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

7. The main part of the program reads a string from the input, calls `func_1` with the input string, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
