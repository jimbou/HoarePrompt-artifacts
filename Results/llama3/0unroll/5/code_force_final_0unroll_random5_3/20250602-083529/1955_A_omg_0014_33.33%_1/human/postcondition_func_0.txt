This function reads input from stdin, expecting t+1 lines, where t is an integer on the first line, and each subsequent line contains three integers n, a, and b. It then calculates and prints the minimum of a*b and a*d for each set of inputs, where d is half of c, rounding a*d to the nearest integer if it's greater than or equal to a*b. The function outputs n lines, each containing the calculated minimum value.
