Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `n` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30, 1 <= `n` <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer from the first line of input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `n` lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `n` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30, 1 <= `n` <= 100).
