Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion as inputs. It then calculates the minimum cost by comparing the total cost of buying yogurts at the regular price (a*b) with the total cost of buying yogurts at the promotion price (a*d), where d is half of the promotion price.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the minimum cost as the minimum of a*b and a*d, but it does not consider the case where the number of yogurts is odd. In such cases, the program should calculate the cost of buying the maximum possible number of yogurts at the promotion price and then add the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

For example, in the third test case of the example, the program calculates the minimum cost as the minimum of 3*5 and 3*11/2, which is 15. However, the correct minimum cost is 15, which can be achieved by buying two yogurts at the promotion price (11) and one yogurt at the regular price (5).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
