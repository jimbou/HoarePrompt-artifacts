Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b) as inputs.

The program calculates the price of one yogurt at the promotion price (d) by dividing the promotion price (b) by 2. Then, it compares the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) with the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d).

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is comparing the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) with the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), but it should be comparing the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n) with the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d).

Moreover, the program is rounding the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d) to the nearest integer, which is incorrect. The total cost should be calculated as the minimum of the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)).

Correctness: **False**
