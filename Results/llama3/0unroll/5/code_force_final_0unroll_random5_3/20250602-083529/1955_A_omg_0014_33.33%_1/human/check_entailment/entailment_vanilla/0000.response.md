Reasoning:

1. The problem asks to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program should consider both the regular price and the promotion price for buying two yogurts.

2. The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments. It first reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.

3. The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, which represent the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

4. The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt if bought at the promotion price.

5. The program then checks if buying `a` yogurts at the regular price (`a * b`) is less than buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price (`a * d`). If it is, the program prints `a * b`. Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

6. The program uses `round(a * d)` to round the result to the nearest integer, which is correct because the price should be an integer.

7. However, the program does not consider the case where `a` is odd. In this case, buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price would leave one yogurt to be bought at the regular price. The program should calculate the total cost as `(a // 2) * c + (a % 2) * b` to handle this case correctly.

8. The program does not handle the case where `a` is 0. Although the problem statement does not explicitly state that `a` can be 0, it is a good practice to handle this case to avoid potential errors.

9. The program does not validate the input values. Although the problem statement guarantees that the input values are valid, it is a good practice to validate the input values to avoid potential errors.

10. The program does not follow the standard naming conventions for Python functions and variables. The function name `func` is not descriptive, and the variable names `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not clear.

Correctness: **False**
