Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the number of yogurts to buy (n) is odd, the program does not consider the optimal strategy of buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price.

In the given program, when `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the case where buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price might be cheaper.

For instance, if `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`, the program will print `15` (which is `3 * 5`), but the optimal solution is to buy two yogurts at the promotion price (`9`) and one yogurt at the regular price (`5`), resulting in a total cost of `14`.

To fix this issue, the program should consider the optimal strategy for both even and odd values of `n`.
