Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, inpstr is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0**

The first line of the code reads a test case from stdin and assigns it to the variable inpstr. Since each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer n and the second input is a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, inpstr becomes a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters. The second line initializes the variable ind1 to 0. The third line initializes the variable ind2 to 0. The fourth line initializes the variable outind to 0. No other variables are affected.
