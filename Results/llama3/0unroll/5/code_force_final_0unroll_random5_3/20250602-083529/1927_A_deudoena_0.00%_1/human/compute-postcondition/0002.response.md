Output State: The loop iterates over the string inpstr and finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B'. If 'B' is found, the loop breaks and the index of 'B' is stored in ind1. If 'B' is not found, the loop completes all iterations and ind1 remains unchanged. The values of ind2 and outind remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
