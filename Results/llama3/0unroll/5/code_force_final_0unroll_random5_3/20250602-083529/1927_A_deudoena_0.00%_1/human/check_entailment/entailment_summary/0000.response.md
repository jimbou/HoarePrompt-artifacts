Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads a string of 'W' and 'B' characters from standard input, which represents the horizontal strip of cells.

2. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string, which marks the start of the segment that needs to be painted white.

3. Next, it finds the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string, which marks the end of the segment that needs to be painted white.

4. Finally, it calculates the length of the segment by subtracting the index of the first 'B' from the length of the string and then subtracting the index of the last 'B'. This gives the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading a string from standard input, finding the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B', and printing the length of the substring between these two indices.

Correctness: **True**
