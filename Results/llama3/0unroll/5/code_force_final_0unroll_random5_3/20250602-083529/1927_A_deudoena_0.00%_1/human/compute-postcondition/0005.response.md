The code prints the difference between the length of the string `inpstr` and the sum of `ind2` and `ind1`, where `ind2` is the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' from the end of the string `inpstr` and `ind1` is a variable whose value is not affected by the loop.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where ind2 is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of inpstr and ind1 is the value of ind1)**
