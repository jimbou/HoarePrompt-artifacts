Output: **The loop iterates over the string inpstr and finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' from the end of the string. If 'B' is found, the loop breaks and the index of 'B' is stored in ind2. If 'B' is not found, the loop completes all iterations and ind2 remains unchanged. The values of ind1 and outind remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop, and the length of the string inpstr minus the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of the string minus the value of ind1 is being printed**
