You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) and then a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters. There is at least one 'B' in s.
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over the string inpstr and finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B'. If 'B' is found, the loop breaks and the index of 'B' is stored in ind1. If 'B' is not found, the loop completes all iterations and ind1 remains unchanged. The values of ind2 and outind remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over the string inpstr and finds the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' from the end of the string. If 'B' is found, the loop breaks and the index of 'B' is stored in ind2. If 'B' is not found, the loop completes all iterations and ind2 remains unchanged. The values of ind1 and outind remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where ind2 is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' from the end of inpstr and ind1 is the value of ind1)

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
