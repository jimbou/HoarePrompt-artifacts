The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of distinct integers. It then determines the minimum number of swaps required to sort the list. If a specific pair of adjacent elements is found, the function outputs 2; otherwise, it outputs 3. The function processes multiple test cases and provides the minimum number of swaps required for each case.
