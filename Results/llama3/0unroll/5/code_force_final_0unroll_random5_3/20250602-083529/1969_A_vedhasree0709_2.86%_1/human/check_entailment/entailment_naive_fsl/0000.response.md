Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2. The friends 1 and 2 can be invited, and both will come to the party since they are each other's best friends and both have invitations.

The program only checks for a specific condition where two friends are each other's best friends and are next to each other in the list. However, this is not the only possible scenario where two friends can be invited and come to the party. The program does not consider other possible cases, such as when two friends are not next to each other in the list or when there are more than two pairs of friends who can be invited.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
