Output State: **The output state is a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of swaps required to sort the list of distinct integers. For each test case, if a pair of adjacent elements in the list is found such that the first element is equal to the second index plus 2 and the second element is equal to the first index plus 1, the output is 2. Otherwise, the output is 3.**
