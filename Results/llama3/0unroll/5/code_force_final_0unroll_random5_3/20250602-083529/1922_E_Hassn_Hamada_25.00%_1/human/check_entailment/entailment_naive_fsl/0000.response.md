Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It generates an array of integers of length at most 200, such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or reports that there is no such array.

The program uses a recursive approach to generate the sequence. The `func_1` function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number, and it uses a binary search-like approach to find the correct sequence.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. It correctly handles the base case where the input number is 0, and it correctly generates the sequence for all other cases. The program also correctly handles the case where the input number is too large to be represented by the sequence, in which case it prints -1.

The program's output matches the expected output for all the provided examples, and it is likely to work correctly for all other cases as well. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
