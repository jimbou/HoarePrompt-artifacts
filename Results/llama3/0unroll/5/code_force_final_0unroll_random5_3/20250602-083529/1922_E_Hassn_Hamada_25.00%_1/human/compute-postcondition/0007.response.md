Output State: **`result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] and `size` is 32.**

In this output state, the value of `result` is determined by the function `func_1` with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The values of `sequence` and `size` remain unchanged.
