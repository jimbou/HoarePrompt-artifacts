Postcondition: **The function has been defined with a docstring that describes its purpose, arguments, and return value. The function takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`. The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence. The initial state of `number` being a positive integer and `sequence` being a list of integers remains unchanged. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0.**
