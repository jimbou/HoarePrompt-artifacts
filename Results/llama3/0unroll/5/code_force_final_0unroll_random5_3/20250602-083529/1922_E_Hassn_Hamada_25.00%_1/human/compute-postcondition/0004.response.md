Output State: **The function has been defined with a docstring that describes its purpose, arguments, and return value. The function takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`. The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence. The initial state of `number` being a positive integer and `sequence` being a list of integers remains unchanged. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0. A new variable `size` is introduced and assigned the value 1.**

In this output state, the function's definition and its arguments remain unchanged. The initial state of `number` and `sequence` also remains the same. However, a new variable `size` is introduced and assigned the value 1. This new variable is not related to the function's arguments or return value, but it is now part of the program's state.
