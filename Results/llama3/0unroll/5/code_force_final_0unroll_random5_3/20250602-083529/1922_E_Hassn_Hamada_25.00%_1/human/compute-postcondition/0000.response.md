Output State: **The function has been defined with a docstring that describes its purpose, arguments, and return value. The function takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`. The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence. The initial state of `number` being a positive integer and `sequence` being a list of integers remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that a function has been defined with a clear description of what it does, what inputs it expects, and what output it returns. The function is now ready to be called with a positive integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence` to generate a sequence of numbers and return its size.
