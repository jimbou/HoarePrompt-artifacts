Functionality: **Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of bits required to represent the input number in binary, appends a sequence of numbers from 0 to the calculated size to the output sequence, and then modifies the sequence by adding the result of a recursive function call to certain elements. The function returns the sum of the calculated size and the result of the recursive function call.**
