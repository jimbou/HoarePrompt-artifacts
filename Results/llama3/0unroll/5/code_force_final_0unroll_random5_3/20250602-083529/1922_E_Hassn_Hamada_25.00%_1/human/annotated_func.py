        #The program returns 0, which is an integer value.
    #State: The function has been defined with a docstring that describes its purpose, arguments, and return value. The function takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`. The function returns an integer value representing the size of the generated sequence. The initial state of `number` being a positive integer and `sequence` being a list of integers remains unchanged. Additionally, `number` is not equal to 0.

    #State: Output State: `result` is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] and `size` is 32.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of `size` which is 32 and `result` which is returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` where `sequence` is a list of integers from 0 to 31.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of bits required to represent the input number in binary, appends a sequence of numbers from 0 to the calculated size to the output sequence, and then modifies the sequence by adding the result of a recursive function call to certain elements. The function returns the sum of the calculated size and the result of the recursive function call.
