Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left. The program first reads the input, then for each test case, it finds the value of the favorite cube, counts the number of cubes with the same value, and counts the number of cubes with a greater value. Based on these counts and the given threshold k, it prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
