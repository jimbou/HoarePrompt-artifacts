Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. It first finds the value of the favorite cube and counts the number of cubes with the same value. Then, it counts the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value. Based on these counts, it determines whether the favorite cube will be removed or not.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value is greater than or equal to k, the favorite cube will be removed, and the program prints 'YES'.
* If the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value plus the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is less than or equal to k, the favorite cube will not be removed, and the program prints 'NO'.
* In all other cases, the favorite cube may or may not be removed, and the program prints 'MAYBE'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is 1 or when the favorite cube's value is the maximum or minimum value among all cubes.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
