Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a string of characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters in each string, plus the number of '*' characters that appear before the first '@' character, but only if there is at most one '*' character before the first '@' character. If there are two '*' characters before the first '@' character, the count is not incremented. The function prints the count for each test case.**
