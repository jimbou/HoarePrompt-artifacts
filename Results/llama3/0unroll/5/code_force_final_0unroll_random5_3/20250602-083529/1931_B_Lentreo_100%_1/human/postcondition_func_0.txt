Determines if a list of non-negative integers can be rearranged to have a specific average value. The function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns 'YES' if the list can be rearranged to have the average value equal to the sum of the elements divided by the length of the list, and 'NO' otherwise. The function checks if the sum of the elements is divisible by the length of the list and if the cumulative sum of the differences between each element and the mean is never negative.
