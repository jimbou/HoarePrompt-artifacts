Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program correctly returns 'NO' because it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. If the total sum is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the containers and calculates the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean amount. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container have the mean amount of water. In this case, the program correctly returns 'NO'.

4. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another. In this case, the program correctly returns 'YES'.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the given operation.

Correctness: **True**
