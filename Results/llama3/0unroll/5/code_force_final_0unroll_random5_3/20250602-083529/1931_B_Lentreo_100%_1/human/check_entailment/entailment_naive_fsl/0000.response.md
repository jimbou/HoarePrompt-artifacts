Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly in this case.

2. It then calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.

3. It iterates through the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the mean. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to distribute to the current container, so it returns 'NO'.

4. If the program finishes iterating through all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1, or where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers. It also correctly handles cases where the water levels in the containers are not initially equal.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
