The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the length of the list `nums` to the variable `n`. The second line calculates the sum of all elements in the list `nums` and assigns it to the variable `total`.

Since the initial state specifies that the sum of `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, we can infer that `total` will be a multiple of `n`.

Output State: **n is the length of the list nums, total is a multiple of n equal to the sum of all elements in nums, nums is a list of non-negative integers**
