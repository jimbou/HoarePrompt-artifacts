Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. 

The program first checks if the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, it immediately returns 'NO'. 

Then, it calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have. It iterates over the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean amount. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the mean amount, so it returns 'NO'. 

If the program finishes iterating over the containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
