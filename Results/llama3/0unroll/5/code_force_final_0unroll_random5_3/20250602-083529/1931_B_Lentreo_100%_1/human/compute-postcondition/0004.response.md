Output State: **n is the length of the list nums, total is a multiple of n equal to the sum of all elements in nums, nums is a list of non-negative integers, mean is the average of the elements in nums, curr is 0**

In this final state, the value of `mean` is calculated as the integer division of `total` by `n`, which represents the average of the elements in the list `nums`. The value of `curr` is set to 0. The values of `n`, `total`, and `nums` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
