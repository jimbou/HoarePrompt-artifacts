Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining whether three given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c, while a peak satisfies the condition a<b>c.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.

3. Inside the function, it first reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.

4. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

5. The program then checks the conditions for a stair and a peak. If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR". If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK". If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

6. The program correctly handles the conditions for a stair and a peak. However, it does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, which should also print "NONE".

7. Despite this minor oversight, the program is correct for the given problem description and the provided example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
