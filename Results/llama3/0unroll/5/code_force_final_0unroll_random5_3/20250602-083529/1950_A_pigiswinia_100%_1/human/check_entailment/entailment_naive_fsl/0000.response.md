Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c) and prints the corresponding output. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all possible cases, including when the digits are equal (e.g., 0 0 0), and when the digits do not form a stair or a peak (e.g., 4 1 7). The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for all the examples provided.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
