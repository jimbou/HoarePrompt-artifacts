Functionality: **This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three space-separated digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). It then classifies each set of three digits into one of three categories: 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b > c, or 'NONE' otherwise. The function prints the classification for each set of digits on a separate line, resulting in a total of t output lines. The original value of t remains unchanged.**
