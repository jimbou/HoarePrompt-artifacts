The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three space-separated digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The first input is an integer, so it is assigned to `t`. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin is t lines each containing three space-separated digits.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines each containing three space-separated digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**
