Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each test case, indicating whether the binary string in that test case meets the conditions specified in the loop. The value of `t` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The stdin will be empty, as all input has been consumed by the loop.**
