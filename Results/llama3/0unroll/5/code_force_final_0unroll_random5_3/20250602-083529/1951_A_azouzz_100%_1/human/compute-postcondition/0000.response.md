Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of size `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) because it is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now contains only one input: a binary string of size `t`, because the first input (the integer) has already been read and assigned to `t`.
