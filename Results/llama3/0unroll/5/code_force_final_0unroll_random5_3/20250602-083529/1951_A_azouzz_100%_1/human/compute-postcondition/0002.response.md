Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then evaluates the binary string based on specific conditions: if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and odd, it prints 'NO'; if the count of '1's is 1, it prints 'NO'; if the string contains '11', it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results, leaving the input unchanged and consuming all input from standard input.**
