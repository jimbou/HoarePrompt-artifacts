Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The conditions are:

1. The sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of the elements in the corresponding subarray of array b.
2. No element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in array b.
3. All elements in array b are positive.

The program uses the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to calculate the cumulative sum of the array `a`, and then uses this cumulative sum to calculate the sum of the elements in each subarray.

The program also uses a separate array `b` to keep track of the number of elements in each subarray that are greater than 1. This is used to calculate the minimum sum of the elements in the corresponding subarray of array b, which is required to be greater than the sum of the elements in the subarray.

The program then checks each query to see if the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the minimum sum of the elements in the corresponding subarray of array b. If it is, the program prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore I conclude that the program is correct.
