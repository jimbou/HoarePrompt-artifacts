Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the input array `a` using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module. This is correct because it allows for efficient calculation of the sum of elements in any subarray.

2. The program calculates the second list `b` where each element `b[i]` is the sum of `b[i-1]` and 1 if the corresponding element in the input list `a` is greater than 1, otherwise 2. This is correct because it implements the condition that each element in the array `b` should be greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in array `a`.

3. The program answers each query by checking if the sum of elements in the input list `a` from `x` to `y` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in list `b` from `x` to `y`. This is correct because it implements the condition that the sum of elements in array `a` should be equal to the sum of elements in array `b`.

4. The program handles the edge case where `x` is equal to `y` by printing 'NO'. This is correct because a single-element subarray cannot be good according to the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
