Output State: The loop iterates q times, each time reading two integers x and y from standard input, and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in array a from index x to y is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in array b from index x to y, and 'NO' otherwise. The values of n, q, b, and stdin remain unchanged.
