Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of n+1 integers, b is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains a list of space-separated integers and a number of queries, each query being a space-separated list of two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `q` are integers, which were obtained from the first line of the input. The list `a` contains `n+1` integers, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the space-separated integers from the second line of the input. The list `b` contains `n+1` zeros, which were initialized in the third line of the code. The stdin still contains a list of space-separated integers and a number of queries, each query being a space-separated list of two integers, as the code only processed the first three lines of the input.
