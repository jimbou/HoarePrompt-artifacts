This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer n, a list of n+1 integers, and a list of q queries. It then calculates a cumulative sum of the input list and a second list b, where each element b[i] is the sum of b[i-1] and 1 if the corresponding element in the input list is greater than 1, otherwise 2. The function then answers q queries, each consisting of two integers x and y, by printing 'YES' if the sum of elements in the input list from x to y is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in list b from x to y, and 'NO' otherwise.
