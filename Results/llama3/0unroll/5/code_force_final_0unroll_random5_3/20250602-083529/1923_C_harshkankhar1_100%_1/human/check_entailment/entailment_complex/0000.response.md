Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of elements `n`, the number of queries `q`, the input list `a`, and the queries themselves.

2. The program correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the input list `a` using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module.

3. The program correctly calculates the list `b`, where each element `b[i]` is the sum of `b[i-1]` and 1 if the corresponding element in the input list `a` is greater than 1, otherwise 2. This is done using a simple loop.

4. The program correctly answers each query by checking if the sum of elements in the input list `a` from `x` to `y` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in list `b` from `x` to `y`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

5. The program correctly handles the edge case where `x` is equal to `y` by printing 'NO' in this case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it does so in an efficient and readable way.

Correctness: **True**
