Output State: **The value of a[i] is updated for each i from 1 to n, where a[i] is the sum of all elements in a from index 0 to i. The values of n, q, b, and stdin remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of a[i] is the cumulative sum of all elements in a up to index i. For example, if a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then after the execution of the code, a will be [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]. The values of n, q, b, and stdin are not affected by the code and remain the same as in the initial state.
