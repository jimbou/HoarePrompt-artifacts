You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case). The first integer is a positive integer and the integers in the list are positive integers less than or equal to 2 * 10^5.
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will run indefinitely because the range is set to infinity. The values list will continue to grow indefinitely, with each index i being the sum of the digits of i plus the value at index i-1. The sum_value_digits variable will continue to calculate the sum of the digits of each number i. The variable i will continue to increment indefinitely.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will run for a finite number of iterations, equal to the value of t. The values list will be accessed and printed at the index equal to the input value, for each iteration. The variable i will not be used in the loop body, and the sum_value_digits variable will not be used or updated in the loop.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
