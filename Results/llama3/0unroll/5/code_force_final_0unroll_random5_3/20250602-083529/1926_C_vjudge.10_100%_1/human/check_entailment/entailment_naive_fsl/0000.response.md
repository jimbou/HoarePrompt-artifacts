Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a pre-computation approach to store the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in the `values` array. Then, for each test case, it simply prints the pre-computed sum for the given number.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1, 2, or 3, as well as larger values of n. The time complexity of the program is O(n), which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
