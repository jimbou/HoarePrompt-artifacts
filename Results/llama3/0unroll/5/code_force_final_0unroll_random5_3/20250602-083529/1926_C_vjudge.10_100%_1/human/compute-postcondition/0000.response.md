Output State: **t is a positive integer, values is a list of 200001 zeros, stdin contains a list of integers (the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case).**

The first line assigns the value of `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` to `inf`, which is a constant value. The second line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`, which is a positive integer. The third line creates a list of `inf` zeros and assigns it to `values`. Since `inf` is `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`, the list `values` has a length of 200001. The stdin now contains a list of integers, which are the largest numbers Vladislav writes for each test case.
