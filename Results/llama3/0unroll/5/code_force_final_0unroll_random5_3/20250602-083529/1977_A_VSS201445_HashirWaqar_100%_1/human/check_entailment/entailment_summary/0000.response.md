Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, and outputs "Yes" if it's possible to obtain a tower with m cubes and "No" otherwise.

The program's logic is based on the condition that n should be greater than or equal to m, and the difference between n and m should be even. This is because Nikita can only add or remove 1 cube at a time, so the number of moves required to reach m cubes should be an even number.

The program correctly implements this logic using the condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes", indicating that it's possible to obtain a tower with m cubes. Otherwise, it prints "No".

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing "Yes" or "No" for each input pair based on the conditions.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
