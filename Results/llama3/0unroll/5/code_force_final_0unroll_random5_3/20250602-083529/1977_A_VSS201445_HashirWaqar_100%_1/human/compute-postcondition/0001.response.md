Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and m. It then prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each pair of n and m, depending on whether n is greater than or equal to m and their difference is even. The function outputs t lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions are met for each input pair.**
