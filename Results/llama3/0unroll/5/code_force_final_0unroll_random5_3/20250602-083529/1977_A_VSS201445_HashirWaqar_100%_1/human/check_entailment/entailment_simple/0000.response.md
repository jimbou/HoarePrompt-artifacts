Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It iterates over each test case, reads the values of n and m, and checks if n is greater than or equal to m and if the difference between n and m is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

*   If n is less than m, it's impossible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
*   If n is greater than or equal to m, but the difference between n and m is odd, it's also impossible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. This is because Nikita can only add or remove cubes in pairs (one cube at a time), so the difference between n and m must be even to achieve the desired number of cubes.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
