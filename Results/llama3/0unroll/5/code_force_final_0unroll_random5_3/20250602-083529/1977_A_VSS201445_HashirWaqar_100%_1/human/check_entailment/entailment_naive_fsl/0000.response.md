Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem states that Nikita can either put exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after n moves can be either n (if Nikita only puts cubes) or 0 (if Nikita only removes cubes), or any number in between (if Nikita alternates between putting and removing cubes).

The program checks if n is greater than or equal to m (the desired number of cubes) and if the difference between n and m is even. This is because if n is greater than or equal to m, Nikita can always put enough cubes to reach m, and if the difference is even, Nikita can remove the remaining cubes in pairs, ending up with m cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when n is equal to m, when n is greater than m, and when n is less than m. It also correctly handles cases where the difference between n and m is even or odd.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
