Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It iterates over each test case, reads the values of n and m, and checks two conditions:

1.  If n is greater than or equal to m, it means that Nikita has enough moves to build a tower with at least m cubes.
2.  If the difference between n and m is even, it means that Nikita can end up with exactly m cubes after n moves. This is because Nikita can put m cubes on top of the tower and then remove (n - m) / 2 cubes from the top of the tower twice, resulting in a tower with exactly m cubes.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. It handles the cases where n is greater than or equal to m and the difference between n and m is even, as well as the cases where these conditions are not met.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
