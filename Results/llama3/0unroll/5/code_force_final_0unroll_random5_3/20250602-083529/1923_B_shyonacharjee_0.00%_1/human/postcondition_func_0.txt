This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings indicating whether each test case was successful or not. It takes no parameters and returns no values, only printing the results to the console. The function's purpose is to determine whether a set of monsters can be defeated with a limited number of bullets, considering their positions and health points. It performs the following actions: reads input data, sorts monsters by their distance, calculates the total bullets used, and checks if the total bullets used exceeds the time available. Based on this calculation, it outputs 'YES' if the test case is successful and 'NO' otherwise.
