This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n-1 integers. It then generates a sequence of n integers, starting with 500, where each subsequent integer is the sum of the previous integer and the corresponding input integer. The function prints each sequence of integers for all test cases.
