Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program correctly initializes the first element of the array `a` to a value within the range `[1, 10^9]`, which is `500` in this case.

2. The program then iterates over the rest of the array `x` and calculates the corresponding elements of the array `a` using the formula `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`, as required by the problem statement.

3. The program prints the elements of the array `a` as required by the problem statement.

The program works correctly for all possible inputs because it correctly implements the mathematical relationship between the elements of the arrays `x` and `a`. The choice of `500` as the initial value of `a[0]` is arbitrary, but it is within the allowed range and does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
