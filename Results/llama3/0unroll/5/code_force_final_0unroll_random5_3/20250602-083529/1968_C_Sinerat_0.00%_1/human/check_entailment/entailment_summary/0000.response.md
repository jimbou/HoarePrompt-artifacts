Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer n followed by n-1 integers.
* It initializes the first element of the sequence a to 500, which satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
* For each subsequent element in the sequence, it calculates a[i] as the sum of the previous element a[i-1] and the corresponding input integer x[i-1]. This ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
* The program prints the generated sequence of integers for each test case.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the output matches the expected results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
