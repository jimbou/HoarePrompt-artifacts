Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program reads the correct number of inputs: It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`.

2. The program initializes the array `a` correctly: It sets `a[0]` to 500, which is a valid value according to the problem statement.

3. The program calculates the subsequent values of `a` correctly: It sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, which ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

4. The program prints the correct output: It prints the sequence of `n` integers `a_1, ..., a_n`, which satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
