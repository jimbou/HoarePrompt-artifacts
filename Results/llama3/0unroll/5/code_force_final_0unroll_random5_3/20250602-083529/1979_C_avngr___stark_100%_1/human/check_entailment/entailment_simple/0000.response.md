Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for each outcome.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t`, and then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k` for each outcome. It then calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`, which calls `func_1` to calculate the LCM of two numbers.

The program then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for each outcome. If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the bets for each outcome. The use of the LCM ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, as required by the problem.

Correctness: **True**
