#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-zero integers.
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of two non-zero integers a and b, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the absolute value of the least common multiple (LCM) of two non-zero integers a and b.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of two or more non-negative integers.
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `numbers` is a list of two or more non-negative integers, `result` is equal to the result of applying `func_1` to the first element of `numbers` and each subsequent element in `numbers` in sequence.
    return result
    #The program returns the result of applying `func_1` to the first element of `numbers` and each subsequent element in `numbers` in sequence, where `numbers` is a list of two or more non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two or more non-negative integers as input and returns the result of applying a binary function `func_1` to the first element and each subsequent element in sequence. The input list remains unchanged. The function effectively reduces the list to a single value by iteratively applying `func_1` to the accumulator and the next element in the list.
