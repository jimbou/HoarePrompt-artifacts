Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, and it outputs the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, and `func_2` calculates the LCM of all numbers in a list.

The main part of the program first calculates the LCM of all multipliers using `func_2`. Then, it calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. If the total amount of coins to bet is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program outputs -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it outputs the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the LCM of all multipliers and uses it to determine the amount of coins to bet on each outcome. The condition for outputting -1 is also correct, as it ensures that the total amount of coins to bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
