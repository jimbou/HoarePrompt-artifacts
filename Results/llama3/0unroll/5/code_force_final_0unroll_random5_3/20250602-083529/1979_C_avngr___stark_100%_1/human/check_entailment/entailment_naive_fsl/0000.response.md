Correctness: **False**.

The program is trying to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

However, the program does not actually solve this problem. It defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to calculating the least common multiple of a list of numbers, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem.

In fact, the program does not even attempt to solve the problem. It does not take any input, and it does not produce any output. It simply defines two functions and then does nothing.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It does not provide a solution to the problem, and it does not even attempt to do so.
