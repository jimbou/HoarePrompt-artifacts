Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.

`func_1` calculates the absolute value of the LCM of two non-zero integers a and b. `func_2` takes a list of two or more non-negative integers as input and returns the result of applying `func_1` to the first element and each subsequent element in sequence.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome. It then calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2` and distributes the coins among the outcomes by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. If the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets on the outcomes.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers, distributes the coins among the outcomes, and checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is less than the LCM. If the total amount is less than the LCM, it prints the bets on the outcomes; otherwise, it prints -1.

Correctness: **True**
