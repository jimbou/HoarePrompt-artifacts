Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine how to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The provided program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. `func_2` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the first number and each subsequent number in the list.

The program does not directly solve the problem, but it provides a way to calculate the LCM of a list of numbers, which can be used to find the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the list.

However, the problem requires us to find a distribution of coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program does not provide a way to find such a distribution.

Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
