Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, l is 'YES', stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The variable `l` has been assigned the string value 'YES'. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases because one test case has been read to assign the value to `t`. Each test case still consists of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, with the same constraints as before.
