This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints a result for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function iterates over each test case, comparing characters in three input strings (a, b, and c) at corresponding positions. If it finds a position where characters in both a and b differ from the character in c, it sets a flag (l) to 'YES'. If no such position is found after checking all characters, the flag is set to 'NO'. The function then prints the flag value for each test case. The input variable t, representing the number of test cases, remains unchanged.
