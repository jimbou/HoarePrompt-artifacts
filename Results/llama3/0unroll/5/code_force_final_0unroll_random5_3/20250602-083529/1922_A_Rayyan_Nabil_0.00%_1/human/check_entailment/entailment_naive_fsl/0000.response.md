Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the strings a and b have the same character at a certain position, but the string c has a different character at the same position. In this case, the program will print 'NO', but it should print 'YES' because a template can be created where the character at that position is uppercase, and both a and b will match the template while c will not.

For example, if the input is:

3
a
a
b

The program will print 'NO', but it should print 'YES' because a template 'A' can be created where both 'a' and 'a' match the template, but 'b' does not.
