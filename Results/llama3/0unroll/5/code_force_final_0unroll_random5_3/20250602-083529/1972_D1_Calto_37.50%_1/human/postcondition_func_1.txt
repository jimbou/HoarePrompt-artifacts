This function calculates a count based on the input parameters `n` and `m`, both positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. It iterates through a range up to `m`, performing calculations involving `n` and the iteration index `i`. If the calculated count is 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated count, which is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^6. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`.
