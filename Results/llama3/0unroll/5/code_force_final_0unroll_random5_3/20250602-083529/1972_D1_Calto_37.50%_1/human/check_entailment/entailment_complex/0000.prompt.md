Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Functions:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, leaving the input variables modified in the process.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is a positive integer such that 1 <= cnt <= 2 * 10^6.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is a positive integer such that 1 <= cnt <= 2 * 10^6 and cnt is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns a positive integer 'cnt' that is not equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates a count based on the input parameters `n` and `m`, both positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. It iterates through a range up to `m`, performing calculations involving `n` and the iteration index `i`. If the calculated count is 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated count, which is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^6. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`.
