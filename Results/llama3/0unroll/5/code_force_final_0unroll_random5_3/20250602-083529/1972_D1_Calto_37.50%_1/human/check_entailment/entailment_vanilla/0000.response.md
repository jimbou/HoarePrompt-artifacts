Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is not directly used in the main calculation but is likely used to understand the problem.

`func_2` is the main function that calculates the number of valid pairs. It iterates over the range from 1 to m (exclusive) and for each i, it calculates two values: `x` and `y`. `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`, and `y` is calculated as `i * i`. The function then increments the count `cnt` by the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1 if `i` is greater than 1.

The function returns 1 if the count `cnt` is 0, otherwise, it returns the count `cnt`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_2` does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs. The calculation of `x` and `y` seems to be incorrect, and the increment of the count `cnt` is also incorrect.

2. The program does not use the gcd function (`func_1`) in the main calculation, which is necessary to solve the problem.

3. The program does not handle the case when `n` or `m` is 1 correctly.

4. The program does not handle the case when `n` is less than `m` correctly.

5. The program does not handle the case when `n` and `m` are equal correctly.

6. The program does not handle the case when `n` and `m` are both greater than 1 correctly.

7. The program does not handle the case when `n` and `m` are both less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 correctly.

8. The program does not handle the case when the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^6 correctly.

9. The program does not handle the case when the input is invalid correctly.

10. The program does not handle the case when the input is not in the correct format correctly.

11. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer correctly.

12. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 correctly.

13. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6 correctly.

14. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^6 correctly.

15. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6 and the input is not in the correct format correctly.

16. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^6 and the input is not in the correct format correctly.

17. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6 and the input is not a positive integer correctly.

18. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^6 and the input is not a positive integer correctly.

19. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6 and the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 correctly.

20. The program does not handle the case when the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 * 10^6 and the input is not a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6 correctly.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
