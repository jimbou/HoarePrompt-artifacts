Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. The issue lies in the function `func_2(n, m)`. The loop only iterates up to `m-1`, but it should iterate up to `m` because the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. This means that the program is missing the case where `b` equals `m`.

For example, if `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program will not consider the pair `(10, 8)`, which satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the program will return an incorrect count.

To fix this issue, the loop in `func_2(n, m)` should be modified to iterate up to `m`, not `m-1`.
