Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided functions are:

1.  `func_1(a, b)`: calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b, modifying the input variables in the process.
2.  `func_2(n, m)`: calculates a count based on the input parameters n and m, both positive integers within the range 1 to 2 \* 10^6.

However, there is a discrepancy between the problem description and the provided functions. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions, but the provided functions do not seem to directly address this.

`func_1(a, b)` calculates the GCD of two numbers, which is a necessary component in the problem, but it does not calculate the number of ordered pairs.

`func_2(n, m)` calculates a count based on the input parameters, but it does not explicitly calculate the number of ordered pairs satisfying the conditions. The calculations performed in this function seem to be unrelated to the problem description.

Given the provided functions and their execution summaries, it appears that the program is not correctly solving the problem. The functions do not seem to work together to calculate the number of ordered pairs satisfying the conditions.

Correctness: **False**
