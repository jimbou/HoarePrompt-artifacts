Output State: **The output will be `t` lines, each containing a string of lowercase English letters. The string on each line will be `k` characters long, and will consist of the first `k` lowercase English letters (i.e., 'a' through the `k`-th letter of the alphabet). If `k` is 1, the string will be repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, the string will be repeated twice, unless `n` is 1, in which case it will be repeated only once.**
