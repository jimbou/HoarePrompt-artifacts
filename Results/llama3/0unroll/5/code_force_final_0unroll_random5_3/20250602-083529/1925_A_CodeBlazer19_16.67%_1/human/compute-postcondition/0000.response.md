The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) first, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26). After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, and the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).**
