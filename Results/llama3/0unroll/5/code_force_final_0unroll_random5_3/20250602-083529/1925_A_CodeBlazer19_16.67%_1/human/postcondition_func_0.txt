This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k. It then generates a string of the first k lowercase English letters and prints it t times. If k is 1, the string is repeated n times; otherwise, it is repeated twice unless n is 1, in which case it is repeated only once. The output consists of t lines, each containing a string of k characters.
