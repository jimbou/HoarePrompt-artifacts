Output State: **The loop will execute 'a' number of times, each time taking four lines of input from stdin, calculating the area of a square based on the coordinates of its corners, and printing the result. After all iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will continue executing any remaining code. The value of 'a' will remain unchanged, and stdin will be empty if 'a' is equal to the number of test cases.**
