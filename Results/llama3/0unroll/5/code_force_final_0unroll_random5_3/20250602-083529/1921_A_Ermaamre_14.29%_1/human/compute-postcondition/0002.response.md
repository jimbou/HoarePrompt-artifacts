Functionality: **The function reads an integer 't' from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It calculates the area of the square based on the coordinates and prints the result. The function repeats this process 't' times, then terminates, leaving the input stream empty if all test cases are processed.**
