Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4) where (x1, y1) and (x3, y3) are opposite corners and (x2, y2) and (x4, y4) are opposite corners. 

For example, if the input is:

1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will not correctly calculate the area of the square because it assumes that the first two points and the last two points are opposite corners, which is not the case in this example.

The program should be modified to find the correct opposite corners and calculate the area of the square based on those corners.
