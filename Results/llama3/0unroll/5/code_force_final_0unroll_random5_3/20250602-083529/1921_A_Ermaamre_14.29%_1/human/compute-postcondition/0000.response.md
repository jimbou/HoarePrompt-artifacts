Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 testcases. Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of the square.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains t-1 testcases, each with four lines of two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of the square.
