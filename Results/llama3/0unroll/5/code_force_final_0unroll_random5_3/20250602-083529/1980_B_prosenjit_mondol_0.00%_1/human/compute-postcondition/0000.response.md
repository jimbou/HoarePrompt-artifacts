Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' printed to the console, each corresponding to whether the kth largest element in the sorted array is greater than, less than, or equal to the element at index f. The number of outputs is equal to the number of test cases t.**
