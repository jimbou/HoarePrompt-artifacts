Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes (n), the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (f), and the number of removed cubes (k). It subtracts 1 from f and k because Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. It then reads the values shown on the cubes (a) and stores them in a list.

4. The program finds the value of Dmitry's favorite cube (x) by accessing the f-th index of the list a.

5. It sorts the list a in non-increasing order (from largest to smallest) using the sort() function with the reverse=True argument.

6. The program then checks the value of the k-th cube after sorting. If the k-th cube's value is greater than x, it means that Dmitry's favorite cube is not among the first k cubes, so it prints 'NO'.

7. If the k-th cube's value is less than x, it means that Dmitry's favorite cube is among the first k cubes, so it prints 'YES'.

8. If the k-th cube's value is equal to x, the program checks if k is equal to n - 1 (i.e., all cubes have the same value) or if the (k - 1)-th cube's value is less than x. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
