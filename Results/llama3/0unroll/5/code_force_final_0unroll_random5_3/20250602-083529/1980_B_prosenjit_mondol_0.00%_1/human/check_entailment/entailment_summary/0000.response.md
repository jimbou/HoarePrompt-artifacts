Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It reads the input, sorts the array of integers in descending order, and then checks the relationship between the kth largest element and the element at the specified index.

The program correctly handles the three possible cases:

1.  If the kth largest element is greater than the element at the specified index, it prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite cube will not be removed in any case.
2.  If the kth largest element is less than the element at the specified index, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed in all cases.
3.  If the kth largest element is equal to the element at the specified index, it checks if the kth largest element is the last element in the sorted array or if the element before it is less than the favorite cube. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE', indicating that the favorite cube may be either removed or left.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
