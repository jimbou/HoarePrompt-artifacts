Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the favorite cube has the same value as the k-th cube, but there are other cubes with the same value that are not removed. In this case, the program will print 'YES' if the favorite cube is removed, but it may not be removed if the other cubes with the same value are removed instead.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will print 'YES', but the favorite cube may not be removed if the other cube with value 3 is removed instead.

The correct output for this case should be 'MAYBE'.
