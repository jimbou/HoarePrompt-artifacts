Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `f`, and `k`, and adjusts `f` and `k` by subtracting 1 to account for 0-based indexing.
2.  It stores the value of the favorite cube in the variable `x` and sorts the array `a` in descending order.
3.  The program then checks the value of the `k`-th largest element in the sorted array (`a[k]`) and compares it with the value of the favorite cube (`x`).
4.  If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, it means the favorite cube is not among the `k` largest elements, so it will not be removed, and the program prints "NO".
5.  If `a[k]` is less than `x`, it means the favorite cube is among the `k` largest elements, so it will be removed, and the program prints "YES".
6.  If `a[k]` is equal to `x`, the program checks if `k` is equal to `n - 1` (i.e., the favorite cube is the last element in the sorted array) or if the element before `a[k]` is less than `x`. If either condition is true, it means the favorite cube will be removed, and the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it means the favorite cube may be either removed or left, and the program prints "MAYBE".

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the fate of Dmitry's favorite cube based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
