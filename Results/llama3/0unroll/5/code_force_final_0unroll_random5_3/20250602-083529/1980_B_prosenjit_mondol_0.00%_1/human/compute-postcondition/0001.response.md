Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an array of integers and two indices. It then determines whether the kth largest element in the sorted array is greater than, less than, or equal to the element at the specified index, printing 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' to the console for each test case, respectively.**
