Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string of n binary digits. It then finds the index of the position in the string where the number of 1s to the right of the position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 1s and 0s to the right, and the number of 0s to the left of the position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 0s and 1s to the left. If such a position exists, it prints the index of that position; otherwise, it prints 0. The function repeats this process for each test case and empties the standard input.**
