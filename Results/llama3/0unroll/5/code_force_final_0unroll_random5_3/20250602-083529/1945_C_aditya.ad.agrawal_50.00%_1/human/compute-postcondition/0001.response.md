Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, and the output contains the indices of the positions where the conditions are met for each test case.**

In this output state, the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variable `t` has been decremented to 0. The stdin has been fully consumed, and the input strings have been processed. The output contains the indices of the positions where the conditions are met for each test case, which are the positions where the number of 1s to the right of the position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 1s and 0s to the right, and the number of 0s to the left of the position is greater than or equal to half of the total number of 0s and 1s to the left.
