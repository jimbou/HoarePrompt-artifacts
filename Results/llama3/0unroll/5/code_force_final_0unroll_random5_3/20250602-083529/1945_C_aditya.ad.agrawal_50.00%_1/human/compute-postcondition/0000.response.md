Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, because one test case has been read and processed. The remaining test cases still contain two inputs each: an integer n and a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
