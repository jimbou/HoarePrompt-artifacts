Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program uses the formula for the expected value, which is the sum of the products of the probability of choosing a pair and the friendship value of that pair. The probability of choosing a pair is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of the number of pairs of nodes in the graph, which is n*(n-1)//2. The program also correctly handles the case where the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

The program uses the pow function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse, which is more efficient than calculating the inverse manually. The program also uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result is within the range of 0 to 10^9 + 7.

The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case separately. It also correctly prints the result for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
