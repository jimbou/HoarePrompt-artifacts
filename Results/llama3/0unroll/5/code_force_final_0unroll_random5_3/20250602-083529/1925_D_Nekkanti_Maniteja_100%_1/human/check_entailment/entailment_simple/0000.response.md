Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).

2. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is done using the `pow` function with a negative exponent, which is a common way to calculate modular multiplicative inverses in Python.

3. It initializes a variable `s` to 0, which will be used to store the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

4. It initializes a variable `a` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. It then reads the input for each pair of friends, which includes the indices of the pair and their friendship value. It adds the friendship value to `a`.

6. It then calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. This is done by iterating over each excursion and adding the product of the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs, the current excursion number, the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs, the number of pairs of friends, and the sum of the initial friendship values to `s`.

7. Finally, it prints the expected value modulo `10^9 + 7` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, which is `âˆ‘(i=1 to k) (c * i * c * m + c * a) % M`, where `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs, `m` is the number of pairs of friends, `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values, and `M` is `10^9 + 7`.

Correctness: **True**
