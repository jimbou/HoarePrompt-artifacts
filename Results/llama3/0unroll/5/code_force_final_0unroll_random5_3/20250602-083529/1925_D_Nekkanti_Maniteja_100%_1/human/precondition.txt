stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, an integer m, an integer k, and m lines, each containing three integers a, b, and f. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5. For each of the m lines, a and b are integers such that 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= n, and a != b, and f is an integer such that 1 <= f <= 10^9.
