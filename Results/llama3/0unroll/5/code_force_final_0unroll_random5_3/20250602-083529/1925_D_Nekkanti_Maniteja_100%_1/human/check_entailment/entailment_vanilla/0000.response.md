Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).

3. It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs (n * (n - 1) // 2) modulo M (10^9 + 7), where M is a prime number. This is done using the pow function with a negative exponent, which is a built-in way to calculate modular multiplicative inverses in Python.

4. It initializes two variables, s and a. The variable s will store the expected value of the sum of friendship values, and the variable a will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.

5. It then reads the initial friendship values of all pairs and adds them to the variable a.

6. The program then calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. This is done by iterating over each excursion and adding the product of the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs, the current excursion number, the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs, the number of pairs of friends, and the sum of the initial friendship values to the variable s.

7. Finally, it prints the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo M.

Based on the problem description and the provided program, the program seems to be correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion and handles the modular arithmetic correctly.

Correctness: **True**
