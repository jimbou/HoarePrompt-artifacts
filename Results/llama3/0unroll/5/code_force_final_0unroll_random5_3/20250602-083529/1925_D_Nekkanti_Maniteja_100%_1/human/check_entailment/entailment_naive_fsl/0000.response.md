Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the calculation of the probability of choosing a pair of friends. The program uses the formula `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to calculate the probability, but this is incorrect.

The correct probability of choosing a pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, not `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. The `pow` function is used to calculate the modular inverse, but in this case, it is not necessary.

Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The program uses the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, but this is incorrect. The correct formula should take into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends and the friendship value of that pair.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the probability of choosing a pair of friends and then using that probability to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

For example, a correct implementation could be:

```
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = 1 / total_pairs
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + prob * a + prob * i * m
        print(s % M)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the probability of choosing a pair of friends and uses that probability to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
