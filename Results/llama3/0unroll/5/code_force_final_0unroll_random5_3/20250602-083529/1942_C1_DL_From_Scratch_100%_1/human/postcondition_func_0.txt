This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case represents a polygon with a given number of sides and vertices chosen by Bessie. It calculates and prints the total number of vertices that can be chosen by Bessie in each test case, considering the vertices that are not adjacent to any other chosen vertex and the number of vertices Bessie has already chosen, minus 2.
