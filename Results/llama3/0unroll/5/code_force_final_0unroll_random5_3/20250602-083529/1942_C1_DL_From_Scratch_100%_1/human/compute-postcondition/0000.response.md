Output State: **`T` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of the polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of the polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
