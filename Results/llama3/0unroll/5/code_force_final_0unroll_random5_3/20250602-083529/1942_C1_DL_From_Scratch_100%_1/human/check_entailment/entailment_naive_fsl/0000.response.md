Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out.

The program first sorts the list of chosen vertices. Then, it iterates over the sorted list and counts the number of pairs of adjacent vertices that have exactly one vertex between them (i.e., `num == 1`). This is because each such pair can form a triangle with the vertex between them.

Additionally, the program checks if the first and last vertices in the sorted list can form a triangle with the vertex between them (i.e., `num == 1`). This is because the first and last vertices are adjacent in the circular arrangement of the polygon.

Finally, the program adds the number of pairs of adjacent vertices that can form triangles to the number of chosen vertices minus 2, because each pair of adjacent vertices can form a triangle with the vertex between them, and each chosen vertex can form a triangle with the two vertices adjacent to it.

The program correctly handles the case where `y == 0`, because it does not choose any additional vertices beyond the `x` chosen vertices.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
