Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, n is the length of s, ans is an empty string, d is a dictionary with a single key-value pair: 0 maps to 0.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The string `s` remains unchanged, still consisting only of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000. The variable `n` now holds the length of the string `s`. The variable `ans` is an empty string. The dictionary `d` has been initialized with a single key-value pair, where the key 0 maps to the value 0.
