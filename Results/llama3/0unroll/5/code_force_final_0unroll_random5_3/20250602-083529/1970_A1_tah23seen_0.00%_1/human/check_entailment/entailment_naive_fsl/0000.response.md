Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the way the program sorts the columns of the table. According to the problem statement, the columns should be sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. However, the program sorts the columns based on the prefix balance only, without considering the position in case of a tie.

For example, consider the input "(()(()))". The correct balanced shuffle should be "(()(()))", but the program will output "(()(()))" which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to sort the columns based on both the prefix balance and the position. The correct implementation would be to use a custom sorting key that takes into account both the prefix balance and the position.

Here is an example of how the correct implementation could look like:
```
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```
This implementation sorts the columns based on the prefix balance first, and then breaks ties by sorting based on the position in decreasing order.
