Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.
3. It sorts the array `N` in ascending order.
4. It initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will keep track of the current MEX value.
5. It creates a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each element in the array `N`.
6. It iterates over the sorted array `N` and updates the `cur` variable and the `M` dictionary accordingly. If an element is greater than `cur`, it increments `cur` and breaks the loop if the difference is more than 1. Otherwise, it increments the frequency of the element in the `M` dictionary.
7. After the loop, it checks if the sum of frequencies in the `M` dictionary is equal to the size of the array `S`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
8. It creates a list `cnt` to store the elements with frequency 1 in the `M` dictionary.
9. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it updates `cur` to the second element of `cnt`.
10. Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which represents the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the `M` dictionary to store the frequency of elements and the `cnt` list to store elements with frequency 1 is efficient and effective.

Correctness: **True**
