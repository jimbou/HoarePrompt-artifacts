Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. The issue lies in the way the program handles the case when there are multiple elements with the same value in the array. The program only checks if the count of each number is 1, but it does not consider the case when there are multiple elements with the same value and the count is greater than 1.

For example, consider the input [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]. The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 3. The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick one 0, one 1, and then Bob will pick the remaining 0, and then Alice will pick the remaining 1, and finally Bob will pick the remaining 0. The final array c will be [0, 1, 1], which has a MEX of 3.

The program does not correctly handle this case because it only checks if the count of each number is 1, but it does not consider the case when there are multiple elements with the same value and the count is greater than 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
