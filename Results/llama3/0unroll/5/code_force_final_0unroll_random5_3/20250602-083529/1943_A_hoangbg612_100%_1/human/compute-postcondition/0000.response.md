Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases with one line less than before.**

In this output state, the variable `T` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains multiple test cases, but with one line less than before, since the first line has been read and assigned to `T`.
