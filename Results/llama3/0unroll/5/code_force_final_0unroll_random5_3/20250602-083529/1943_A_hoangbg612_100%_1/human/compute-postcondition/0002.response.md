Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then processes each list to find the maximum possible value that can be formed using the given numbers, considering the constraints that the numbers must be in increasing order and each number can be used only once. The function prints the maximum possible value for each test case, separated by a newline character.**
