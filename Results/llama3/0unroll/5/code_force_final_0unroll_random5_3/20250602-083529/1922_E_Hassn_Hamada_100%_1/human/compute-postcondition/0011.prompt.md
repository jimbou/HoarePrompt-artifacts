You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers.
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values: 0 and 0. The first 0 is a direct return value, and the second 0 is also a direct return value. No variables or values from the initial state are included in the return.
    #State: *number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers. number is not equal to 0
    size_overlap = 0, 0
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
        
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = size, i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two integers (size, i) where size is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number and i is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies this condition.
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: Output State: `sequence` is a list of integers, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two integers (size, i) where size is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number and i is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies this condition, `size` is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number, `overlap` is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies the condition (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number, `number` is a positive integer.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns two values: 0 and 0. The first 0 is a direct return value, and the second 0 is also a direct return value. No variables or values from the initial state are included in the return.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
