Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 3, the program outputs [0, 1, 0], but the correct output should be [0, 0, 1] or [0, 1, 2] because these arrays have exactly 3 increasing subsequences.

The issue with the program is in the function `func_1`. The function is trying to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number, but it does not correctly handle the case when the input number is a power of 2. In this case, the function should return a sequence of identical numbers, but instead, it returns a sequence with a different number at the end.

For example, when the input is 4, the program outputs [0, 1, 2, 0], but the correct output should be [0, 0, 0, 0] because this array has exactly 4 increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
