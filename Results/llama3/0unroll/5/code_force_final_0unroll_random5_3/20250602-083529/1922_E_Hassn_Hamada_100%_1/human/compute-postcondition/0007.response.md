Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two integers (size, i) where size is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number and i is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies this condition, `size` is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number, `overlap` is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies the condition (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number.**

In this output state, the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged. The tuple `size_overlap` is unpacked into two separate variables `size` and `overlap`, which hold the largest integer `size` and the smallest integer `overlap` that satisfy the condition `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`, respectively.
