Output State: **`sequence` is a list of integers, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two integers (size, i) where size is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number and i is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies this condition, `size` is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number, `overlap` is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies the condition (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number, `number` is a positive integer, and the function `func_1` has been called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.**

In this output state, the values of `sequence`, `size_overlap`, `size`, `overlap`, and `number` remain unchanged. However, the function `func_1` has been called with a new argument, which is the result of subtracting `(1 << size)` from `number` and adding `(1 << overlap)`. This new argument is a positive integer, as it is derived from the original positive integer `number` and the bitwise operations involving `size` and `overlap`. The function call does not modify the original variables, but it may have side effects or return a value that is not captured in this output state.
