Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence list. If the input number is 0, the function returns two values: 0 and 0. Otherwise, it calculates the largest integer size such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number and the smallest integer i in the sequence that satisfies this condition, then appends a range of integers to the input sequence list based on these values. The function then calls itself recursively with the updated number and sequence.
