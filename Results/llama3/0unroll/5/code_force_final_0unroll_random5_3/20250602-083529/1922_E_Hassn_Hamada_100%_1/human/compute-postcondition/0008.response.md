Output State: The `sequence` list has been extended with integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`, inclusive. The `overlap` variable remains unchanged, still holding the smallest integer in the original sequence that satisfied the condition `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`. The `size` variable also remains unchanged, still holding the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`. The `number` variable remains unchanged as it was not modified in the loop.
