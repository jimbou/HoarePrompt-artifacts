Output State: `sequence` is a list of integers, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two integers (size, i) where size is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number and i is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies this condition, `size` is the largest integer such that (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number, `overlap` is the smallest integer in the sequence that satisfies the condition (1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number, `number` is a positive integer.
