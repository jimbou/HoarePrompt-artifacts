Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move. The problem statement provides examples and a description of the game, but it does not explicitly state the winning condition.

However, based on the provided examples and the execution summary, it appears that the program is implementing a strategy where the player who can make the last move wins. The program checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd and prints 'Bob' if it's even and 'Alice' if it's odd.

This strategy seems to be correct, as the examples provided in the problem statement match the output of the program. For instance, in the first example, the sum of the coins is 2 (1+1), which is even, and Bob wins. In the second example, the sum is 5 (1+4), which is odd, and Alice wins.

Therefore, based on the provided examples and the execution summary, it appears that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
