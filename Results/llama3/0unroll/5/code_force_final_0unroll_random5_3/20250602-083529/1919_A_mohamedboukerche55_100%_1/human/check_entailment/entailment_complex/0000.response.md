Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of two steps: choosing to exchange wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, and then removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The key insight here is that the game is won by the player who has an even number of coins in total, because they can always make a valid move by exchanging wallets and then removing a coin.

The given program correctly implements this insight by checking if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins, and if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the sum of the coins in both wallets is always even if and only if the number of coins in one wallet is even and the number of coins in the other wallet is odd.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
