The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads t lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers a and b. It then prints 'Bob' if the sum of a and b is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd, for each test case. The function does not modify the input values or return any values, but instead prints the results directly to the console.
