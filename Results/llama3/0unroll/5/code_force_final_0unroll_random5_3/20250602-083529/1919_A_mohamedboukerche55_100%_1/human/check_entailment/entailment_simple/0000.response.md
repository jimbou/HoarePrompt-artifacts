Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by noticing that the game is won by the player who can make the last move. This happens when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd. If the sum is even, the game will end with both players having an empty wallet, and the player who started the game (Alice) will lose.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win. If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, and prints the winner of the game.

Correctness: **True**
