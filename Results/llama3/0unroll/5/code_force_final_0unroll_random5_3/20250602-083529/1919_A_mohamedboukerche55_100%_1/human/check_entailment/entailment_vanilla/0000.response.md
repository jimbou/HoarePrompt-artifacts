Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

The provided program uses a simple approach to determine the winner. It calculates the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) and checks if it is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", and if the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

This approach is correct because the game can be analyzed as follows:

* If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves an even number of coins in her wallet. Since Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, he will always have an even number of coins in his wallet as well. Eventually, Alice will run out of coins, and Bob will win.
* If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of coins in her wallet. This will force Bob to make a move that leaves an even number of coins in his wallet. Since Alice can always mirror Bob's moves, she will always have an odd number of coins in her wallet. Eventually, Bob will run out of coins, and Alice will win.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

Correctness: **True**
