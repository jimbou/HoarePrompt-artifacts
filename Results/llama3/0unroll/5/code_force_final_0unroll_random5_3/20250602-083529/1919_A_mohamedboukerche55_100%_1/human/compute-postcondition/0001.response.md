Output State: The output state will be a series of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed to the console, where the number of lines is equal to the value of `t`. Each line will be either 'Bob' or 'Alice', depending on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged.
