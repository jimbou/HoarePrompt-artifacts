Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win because Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves an odd number of coins, allowing Bob to make the last move. On the other hand, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins, forcing Bob to make a move that leaves an odd number of coins, and so on.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", and if the sum is odd, it prints "Alice". This logic is correct for all possible inputs, and therefore the program is correct.
