The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
