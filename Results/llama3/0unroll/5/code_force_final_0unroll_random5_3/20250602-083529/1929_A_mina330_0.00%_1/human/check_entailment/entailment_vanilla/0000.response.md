Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

3. The program uses a loop that runs from 0 to len(a) // 2 (integer division), which means it only considers the first half of the sorted array. This is because the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, are the maximum possible differences that can be obtained.

4. The program correctly calculates the sum of these differences and prints the result.

5. The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop that runs from 0 to ntest (the number of test cases).

6. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
