Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. It first sorts the array in ascending order, then calculates the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the array. This approach ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved by maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

*   When all elements are equal, the beauty is 0.
*   When there are only two elements, the beauty is the difference between them.
*   When there are more than two elements, the beauty is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the array.

The program also handles edge cases, such as when the input array has only one element (although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, the program will still produce the correct result, which is 0).

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
