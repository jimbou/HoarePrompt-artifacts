This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the number of elements in the list) followed by a list of integers. It sorts each list in ascending order, then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest numbers in each list, repeating this process for the specified number of test cases. The function outputs the calculated sums for each test case.
