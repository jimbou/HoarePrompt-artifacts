Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads multiple test cases, sorts each list in ascending order, and then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest numbers in each list.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest numbers in each list, but it does not consider the differences between the other numbers in the list. The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of the differences between each pair of adjacent numbers in the sorted list.

For example, in the first test case, the list [2, 1, 3] is sorted to [1, 2, 3]. The program only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest numbers, which is 3 - 1 = 2. However, it misses the difference between the second and first numbers, which is 2 - 1 = 1. The correct sum of differences should be 2 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
