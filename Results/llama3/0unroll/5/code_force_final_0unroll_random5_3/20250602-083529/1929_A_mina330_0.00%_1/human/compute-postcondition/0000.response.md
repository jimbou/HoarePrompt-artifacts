Output State: **`ntest` is a non-negative integer and less or equal than 100, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of elements in the list) and then a list of integers. The integer is a non-negative integer and less or equal than 100. The integers in the list are between 1 and 10^9.**

In this output state, `ntest` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is a non-negative integer and less or equal than 100. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.
