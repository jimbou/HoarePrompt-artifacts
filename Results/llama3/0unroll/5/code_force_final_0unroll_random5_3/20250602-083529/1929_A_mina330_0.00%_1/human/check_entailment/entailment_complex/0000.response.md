Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the number of elements in the list) followed by a list of integers.

The program sorts each list in ascending order, then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest numbers in each list. This is done by iterating over the first half of the sorted list and adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the list to the total sum.

The program repeats this process for the specified number of test cases and outputs the calculated sums for each test case.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. By sorting the list and calculating the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest numbers, the program effectively finds the maximum possible beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
