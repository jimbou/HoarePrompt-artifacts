Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a valid sequence of integers that can be formed by rearranging the integers in each line, such that the sequence is consistent across all lines. The program handles all possible cases, including when the number of screenshots is 1, when the number of screenshots is 2, and when the number of screenshots is more than 2. It also correctly handles the case when the sequence of integers is not consistent across all lines.

Correctness: **True**
