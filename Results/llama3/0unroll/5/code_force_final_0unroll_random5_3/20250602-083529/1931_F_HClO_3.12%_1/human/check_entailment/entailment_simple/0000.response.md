Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the case when there is only one screenshot (m == 1) and prints 'yes'. For cases with more than one screenshot, it correctly compares the two lists and checks if they are consistent. If they are not consistent, it prints 'no'. If they are consistent, it constructs the correct order of participants by inserting the missing participant at the correct position. It then checks if this order is consistent with the remaining screenshots. If it is, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'.

The program uses a clever trick to handle the case when the two lists are consistent but the missing participant is at the same position in both lists. In this case, it uses the third screenshot to determine the correct order.

The program also correctly handles the case when there are only two screenshots and the missing participant is at the same position in both lists.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
