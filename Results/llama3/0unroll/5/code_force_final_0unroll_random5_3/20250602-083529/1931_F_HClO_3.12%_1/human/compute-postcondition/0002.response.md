Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers each. It then checks if there exists a valid sequence of integers that can be formed by rearranging the integers in each line, such that the sequence is consistent across all lines. The function prints 'yes' if a valid sequence exists for a test case, and 'no' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.**
