Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

Initially, the standard input contains an integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines of `n` integers each.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the standard input. The standard input now contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines of `n` integers each.

The output state is: `t` is an integer, stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines of `n` integers each.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines of `n` integers each.**
