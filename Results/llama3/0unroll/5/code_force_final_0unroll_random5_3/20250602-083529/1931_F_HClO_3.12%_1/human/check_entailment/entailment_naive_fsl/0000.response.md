Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One case where the program fails is when the input is:

3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2

The program should output "YES" because there is a valid order that all screenshots correspond to, which is [1, 2, 3]. However, the program outputs "NO".

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the lists are equal after inserting the missing element, but it does not check if the resulting list is a valid order for all screenshots. In this case, the program inserts the missing element in the wrong position, resulting in an invalid order.

To fix this issue, the program needs to check if the resulting list is a valid order for all screenshots, not just if the lists are equal after inserting the missing element.
