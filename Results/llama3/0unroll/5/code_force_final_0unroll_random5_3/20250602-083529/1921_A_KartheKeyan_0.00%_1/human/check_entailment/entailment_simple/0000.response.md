Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the calculation of the area of the square. The program calculates the area as the product of the square roots of the distances between two pairs of points (p1 and p2). However, this is not the correct way to calculate the area of a square.

The correct way to calculate the area of a square is to find the length of one side and then square it. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the length of one side can be found by calculating the difference between the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of two adjacent points.

In the given program, the calculation of p1 and p2 is incorrect. p1 and p2 are calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of two points, which is not the correct way to calculate the length of a side.

Correctness: **False**
