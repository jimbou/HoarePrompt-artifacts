Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the calculation of the area of the square. The program calculates the area as the product of the square roots of the distances between two pairs of points. However, this is incorrect because the distance between two points on a square is not necessarily the side length of the square.

A correct approach would be to calculate the side length of the square by finding the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent points. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of two adjacent points will give the side length of the square. The area of the square can then be calculated as the square of the side length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

n = int(input())
while n:
    coord = []
    for i in range(4):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        coord.append((x, y))
    coord = sorted(coord)
    side_length = abs(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])
    area = side_length ** 2
    print(area)
    n -= 1
```

Correctness: **False**
