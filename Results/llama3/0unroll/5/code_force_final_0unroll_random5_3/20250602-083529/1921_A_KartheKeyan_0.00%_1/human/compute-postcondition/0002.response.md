Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers x and y, which form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. The function then calculates and prints the area of the square. The function repeats this process t times, until all test cases have been processed, leaving the input stream empty.**
