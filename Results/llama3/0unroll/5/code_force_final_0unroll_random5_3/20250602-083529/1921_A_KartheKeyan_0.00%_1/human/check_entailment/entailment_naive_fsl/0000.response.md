Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it calculates the area of the square using the lengths of the diagonals, which is not the correct approach. The area of a square is the square of the length of its side, not the product of the lengths of its diagonals.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2

The program will calculate the area as:

p1 = (4-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18
p2 = (4-1)^2 + (2-5)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18
res = sqrt(18) * sqrt(18) = 18

However, the correct area of the square is 9, not 18.

The correct approach would be to find the length of one side of the square and then square it to get the area.
