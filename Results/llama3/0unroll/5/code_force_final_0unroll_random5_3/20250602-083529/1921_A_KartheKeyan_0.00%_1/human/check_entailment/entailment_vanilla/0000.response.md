Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program attempts to solve this by sorting the coordinates and calculating the distances between adjacent points.

2. However, the program calculates the distances between points incorrectly. It calculates the distance between the second and first points (p1) and the distance between the fourth and third points (p2), and then multiplies the square roots of these distances. This is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the area of the square.

3. The correct approach would be to calculate the distance between two adjacent points (either horizontally or vertically) and then square this distance to get the area of the square.

4. The program also uses unnecessary complexity by calculating the square roots of p1 and p2 and then multiplying them. This is not necessary and can be simplified.

5. The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates do not form a square. Although the problem statement guarantees that the input coordinates form a square, a robust program should still handle such cases.

6. The program does not follow good coding practices. For example, the variable names are not descriptive, and the code is not well-structured.

7. The program does not include any error handling. If the input is not in the correct format, the program will fail.

8. The program does not include any comments or documentation. This makes it difficult for others to understand how the program works and what it is intended to do.

Correctness: **False**
