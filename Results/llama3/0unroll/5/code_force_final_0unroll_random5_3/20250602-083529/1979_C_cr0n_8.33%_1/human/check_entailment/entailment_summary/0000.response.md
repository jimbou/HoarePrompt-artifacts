Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. 

The program first calculates the product of all the multipliers (k_i) and then calculates the product of all the multipliers divided by each multiplier. This is done to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program then checks if the difference between the product of all the multipliers and the sum of the products divided by each multiplier is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the products divided by each multiplier, which represents the bets on the outcomes.

The program correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and it correctly calculates the bets on the outcomes when a solution exists.

Correctness: **True**
