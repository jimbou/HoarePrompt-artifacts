Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (N) and the multipliers for each outcome (vals).

2. It calculates the product of all multipliers (prod) and then calculates the product of all multipliers divided by each multiplier (vprod).

3. It calculates the difference between the product of all multipliers and the sum of the products divided by each multiplier (den). If this difference is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

4. If the difference is greater than 0, it prints the products divided by each multiplier, which represents the bets on each outcome.

The program correctly implements the logic to find a solution that satisfies the constraints of the problem. If a solution exists, it will always find one. If no solution exists, it will correctly print -1.

Correctness: **True**
