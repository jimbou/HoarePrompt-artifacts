Output State: **The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of N, vals, prod, vprod, and den remain unchanged. The current value of den is still less than or equal to 0. The program does not print anything, as the stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and -1 is printed, but this is not related to the return statement.**
