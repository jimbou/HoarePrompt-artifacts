The code prints a string of space-separated integers, where each integer is the product of all integers in the list `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. This is essentially the list `vprod`.

Since the exact values of the integers in `vals` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `vprod`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated products.

Output: **[product of all integers in vals divided by the first element in vals] [product of all integers in vals divided by the second element in vals] ... [product of all integers in vals divided by the last element in vals]**
