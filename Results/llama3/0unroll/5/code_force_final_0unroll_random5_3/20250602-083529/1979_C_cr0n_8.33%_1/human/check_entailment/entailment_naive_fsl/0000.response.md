Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
2 2 2

The program will output:

-1

However, a correct solution would be to bet 1 coin on each outcome, which would result in a total of 3 coins bet and a return of 4 coins for each winning outcome.

The issue with the program is that it calculates the product of all the multipliers and then tries to find a common denominator that is less than the product. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

In the example above, the program calculates the product as 2*2*2 = 8 and then tries to find a common denominator that is less than 8. However, it fails to find such a denominator and outputs -1. However, a correct solution would be to bet 1 coin on each outcome, which would result in a total of 3 coins bet and a return of 4 coins for each winning outcome.
