Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`cases`) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the multipliers for each outcome (`vals`).

3. It then calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and the product of all multipliers except each individual multiplier (`vprod`).

4. The program calculates the denominator (`den`) by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `prod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

5. If `den` is greater than 0, the program prints the values in `vprod` as the bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, then the bets can be distributed in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is equal to the product of all multipliers minus the sum of the product of all multipliers except each individual multiplier.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not consider the case where the product of all multipliers is equal to the sum of the product of all multipliers except each individual multiplier. In this case, the denominator (`den`) will be 0, and the program will print -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. However, this is not necessarily true. The program should handle this case separately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
