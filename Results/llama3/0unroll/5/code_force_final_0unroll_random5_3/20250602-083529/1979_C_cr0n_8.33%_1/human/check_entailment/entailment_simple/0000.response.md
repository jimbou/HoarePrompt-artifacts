Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, calculates the product of all multipliers, and then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the product by the corresponding multiplier. The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If it is, the program prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The calculation of the product of all multipliers and the division of the product by each multiplier to get the amount of coins to bet on each outcome is correct. The check for the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes being strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome is also correct.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes by subtracting the sum of the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome from the product of all multipliers. This is incorrect because the product of all multipliers is not the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes. The correct calculation for the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is the sum of the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome.

Correctness: **False**
