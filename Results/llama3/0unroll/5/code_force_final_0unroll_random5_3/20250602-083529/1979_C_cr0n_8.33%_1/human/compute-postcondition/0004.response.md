Postcondition: **N is an integer, vals is a list of integers, prod is the product of all integers in vals, vprod is a list of integers where each element is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding element in vals, den is an integer equal to the product of all integers in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod. The current value of den is less than or equal to 0. stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
