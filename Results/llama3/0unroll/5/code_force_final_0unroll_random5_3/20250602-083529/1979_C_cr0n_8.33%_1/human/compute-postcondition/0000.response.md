Output State: **N is an integer, vals is a list of integers, prod is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the first line of the current test case from stdin to N. Since each test case consists of two lines, this means that stdin now contains one less test case. The second line assigns a list of integers from the second line of the current test case to vals. This line also consumes the second line of the current test case from stdin, leaving stdin with one less test case than initially. The third line initializes the variable prod to 1. No other variables are affected.
