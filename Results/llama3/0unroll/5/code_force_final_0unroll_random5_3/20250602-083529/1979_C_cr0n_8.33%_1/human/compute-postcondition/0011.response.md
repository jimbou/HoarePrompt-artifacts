Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, calculates the product of all integers in the test case, and then calculates the product of all integers divided by each integer. If the difference between the product of all integers and the sum of the products divided by each integer is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the products divided by each integer. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables.**
