The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then checks the count of '1's in the binary string and their positions, printing 'YES' if the count is 0, or if the count is greater than 2 and even, or if the count is 2 and the '1's are not adjacent. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, leaving the input value unchanged after execution.
