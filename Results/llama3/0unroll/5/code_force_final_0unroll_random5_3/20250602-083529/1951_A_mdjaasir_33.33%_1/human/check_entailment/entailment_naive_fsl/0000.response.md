Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string `a` contains two '1's that are adjacent, but not at the start or end of the string. In this case, the program will incorrectly print 'YES' when it should print 'NO'.

For example, if the input is `n = 4` and `a = '0110'`, the program will print 'YES', but it should print 'NO' because it is not possible to reach this configuration by turning on two non-adjacent lamps at a time.

The issue is in the line `if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':`, which only checks if the first '1' is not followed by another '1', but does not check for adjacent '1's in the rest of the string.
