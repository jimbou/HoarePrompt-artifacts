Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of size n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer between 1 and 1000, which is the first input from the test case. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only has one input left, which is a binary string of size n (1 <= n <= 50).
