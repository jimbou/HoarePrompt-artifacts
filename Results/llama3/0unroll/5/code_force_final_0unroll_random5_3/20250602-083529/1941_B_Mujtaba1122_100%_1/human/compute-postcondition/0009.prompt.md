You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers and n is a positive integer such that n is equal to the length of the list and n is greater than or equal to 3.
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The list contains non-negative integers, and the value of n remains unchanged. The first and last elements of the list remain unchanged. All other elements in the list are either 0 or 1. If any element in the list (except the first and last) is not 0 or 1, the loop prints 'no' and terminates.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *The list contains non-negative integers, and the value of n remains unchanged. The first and last elements of the list remain unchanged. All other elements in the list are either 0 or 1. If the function func_1 returns True for the given list and n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if func_1 returns False, 'NO' is printed. If any element in the list (except the first and last) is not 0 or 1, the loop prints 'no' and terminates.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The list contains non-negative integers, and the value of n remains unchanged. The first and last elements of the list remain unchanged. All other elements in the list are either 0 or 1. The function func_1 has returned True for the given list and n, indicating that the list and n satisfy the condition checked by func_1, and 'YES' is being printed

Case_2: The list contains non-negative integers, and the value of n remains unchanged. The first and last elements of the list remain unchanged. All other elements in the list are either 0 or 1. If any element in the list (except the first and last) is not 0 or 1, the loop prints 'no' and terminates. Additionally, the function func_1(list, n) returns False, and 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
