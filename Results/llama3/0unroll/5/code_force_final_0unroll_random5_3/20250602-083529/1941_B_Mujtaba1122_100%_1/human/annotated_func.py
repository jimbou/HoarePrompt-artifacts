    #State: *The list contains non-negative integers, and the value of n remains unchanged. The first and last elements of the list remain unchanged. All other elements in the list are either 0 or 1. If the function func_1 returns True for the given list and n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if func_1 returns False, 'NO' is printed. If any element in the list (except the first and last) is not 0 or 1, the loop prints 'no' and terminates.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and its length as input, modifies the list by performing a series of operations on its elements (except the first and last), and then checks if the modified list satisfies a certain condition using the function func_1. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If any element in the list (except the first and last) becomes a value other than 0 or 1 during the operations, it prints 'no' and terminates. The function does not return any value, but its output is either 'YES', 'NO', or 'no' depending on the state of the list after the operations.
