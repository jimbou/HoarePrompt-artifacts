Postcondition: **The list contains non-negative integers, and the value of n remains unchanged. The first and last elements of the list remain unchanged. All other elements in the list are either 0 or 1. If any element in the list (except the first and last) is not 0 or 1, the loop prints 'no' and terminates. Additionally, the function func_1(list, n) returns False.**
