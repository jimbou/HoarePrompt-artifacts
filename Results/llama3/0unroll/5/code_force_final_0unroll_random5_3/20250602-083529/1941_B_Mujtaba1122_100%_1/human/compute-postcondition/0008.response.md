Postcondition: ***The list contains non-negative integers, and the value of n remains unchanged. The first and last elements of the list remain unchanged. All other elements in the list are either 0 or 1. If the function func_1 returns True for the given list and n, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if func_1 returns False, 'NO' is printed. If any element in the list (except the first and last) is not 0 or 1, the loop prints 'no' and terminates.***
