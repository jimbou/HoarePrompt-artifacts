Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if the first `n` elements of a list are all zero, returning `False` if any are non-zero and `True` otherwise. This function is used by `func_2` to check the final state of the list after the operations.

`func_2` takes a list of non-negative integers and its length as input, modifies the list by performing a series of operations on its elements (except the first and last), and then checks if the modified list satisfies a certain condition using `func_1`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If any element in the list (except the first and last) becomes a value other than 0 or 1 during the operations, it prints 'no' and terminates.

The program's logic is based on the idea that if the list can be made all zeros, then the sum of the elements at even indices must be equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices. The operations performed by `func_2` aim to achieve this balance by reducing the elements at even indices and increasing the elements at odd indices.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1.  The operations performed by `func_2` are not correctly implemented. The current implementation subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]`, which is not the intended operation.
2.  The program does not handle the case where the list has only one or two elements correctly.
3.  The program does not check if the input list is valid (i.e., contains only non-negative integers).

Due to these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
