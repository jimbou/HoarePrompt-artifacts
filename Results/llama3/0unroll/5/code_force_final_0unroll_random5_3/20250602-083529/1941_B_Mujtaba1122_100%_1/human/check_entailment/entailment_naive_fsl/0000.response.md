Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 7, 2] (as shown in the problem description), the program will print 'NO' instead of 'NO' because the function func_2 does not correctly handle the case where the list has only 4 elements. 

In this case, the function func_2 will try to access list[i + 1] when i is the last index of the list, which will result in an "IndexError: list index out of range" error. 

Also, the function func_2 does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation should subtract 1 from a_{i - 1}, subtract 2 from a_i, and subtract 1 from a_{i + 1}, but the function func_2 subtracts 1 times list[i - 1] from a_{i + 1}, subtracts 2 times list[i - 1] from a_i, and subtracts 1 times list[i - 1] from a_{i - 1}. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
