Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the list and checking if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, and the current element is greater than 10, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them into the list. It then checks if the list is sorted using the `func_1` function. If the list is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The `func_1` function is not necessary. The program can simply check if the list is sorted using the `sorted` function.
2. The program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element, but it does not check if the current element is greater than the previous element. This means that the program may not correctly handle cases where the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. The program does not handle cases where the list contains elements that are less than 10. In such cases, the program will not split the element into its digits, but it will still check if the list is sorted.

To fix these issues, the program can be modified as follows:

```
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p]:
            if list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
            else:
                break
    if list1 == sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This modified program correctly handles cases where the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order, and it also handles cases where the list contains elements that are less than 10.

Correctness: **False**
