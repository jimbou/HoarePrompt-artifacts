Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, which is a sorted version of `lst`.**

In this output state, the value of `lst` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state. However, a new variable `sorted_lst` is introduced, which is assigned the sorted version of `lst` in ascending order. This means that `sorted_lst` contains the same integers as `lst`, but in a sorted manner.
