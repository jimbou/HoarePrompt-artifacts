Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements. It then iterates through the array from the second element to the end. If the current element is not in non-decreasing order with the previous element, it checks if the previous element is greater than 10. If it is, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them in the same position.

After iterating through the entire array, it checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using the function `func_1`. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks if the current element is not in non-decreasing order with the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10. It does not consider the case where the current element is greater than 10 and can be split to make the array sorted.

For example, consider the array [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] and then it will not split the third element because it is not greater than the previous element. However, the third element can be split to make the array sorted.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
