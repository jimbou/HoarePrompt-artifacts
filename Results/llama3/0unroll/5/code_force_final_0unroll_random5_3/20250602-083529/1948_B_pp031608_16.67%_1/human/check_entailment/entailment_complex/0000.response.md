Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The program iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, and the current element is greater than 10, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them into the array. The program then checks if the array is sorted after this operation. If the array is sorted, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, but based on the provided state of the program right before the function call, it is clear that it checks if the input list is sorted in ascending order. This function is used to check if the array is sorted after the operation.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the operation cannot make the array sorted.

Correctness: **True**
