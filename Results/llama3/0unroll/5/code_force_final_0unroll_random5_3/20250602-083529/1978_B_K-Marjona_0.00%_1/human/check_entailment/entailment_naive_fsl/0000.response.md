Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. It first calculates the optimal value of k, which is the minimum of n and b-a. If b is less than or equal to a, it means that the modified price is not beneficial, so it simply prints the profit obtained by selling all buns at the usual price a.

If b is greater than a, it calculates the profit obtained by selling the first k buns at the modified price and the remaining (n-k) buns at the usual price a. The formula used to calculate the profit is correct, as it takes into account the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where k is 0 (i.e., all buns are sold at the usual price) or k is equal to n (i.e., all buns are sold at the modified price). The examples provided in the problem description also match the output of the program, which further confirms its correctness.
