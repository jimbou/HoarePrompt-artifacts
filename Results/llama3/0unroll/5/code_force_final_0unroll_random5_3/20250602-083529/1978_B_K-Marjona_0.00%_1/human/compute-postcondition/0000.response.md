Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, each representing the maximum sum of n integers in the range [a, b] that can be obtained by selecting k integers from the range [a, b] and the remaining (n-k) integers from the range [a, a+k-1]. The list contains t integers, where t is the number of test cases.**
