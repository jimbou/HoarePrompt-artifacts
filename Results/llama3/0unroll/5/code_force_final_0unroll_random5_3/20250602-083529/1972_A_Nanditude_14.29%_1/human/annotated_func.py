#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of three elements: the first element is a positive integer n, the second element is a list a of length n, and the third element is a list b of length n. a and b are lists of non-decreasing positive integers not greater than 10^9.
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of three elements in descending order. The first element is a positive integer n, the second element is a list a of length n, and the third element is a list b of length n. a and b are lists of non-decreasing positive integers not greater than 10^9. The list is sorted in descending order based on the values of n, a, and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a list of three elements: a positive integer n and two lists a and b of length n, containing non-decreasing positive integers not greater than 10^9. It returns a new list with the same elements, sorted in descending order based on the values of n, a, and b.
