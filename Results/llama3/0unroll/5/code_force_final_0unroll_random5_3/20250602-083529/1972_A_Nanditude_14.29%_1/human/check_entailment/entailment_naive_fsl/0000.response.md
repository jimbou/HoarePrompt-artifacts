Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the program inserts the new problem into the array `a`. The program inserts the new problem at the current index `i` and then increments `i` and `j`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the array `a` will be sorted in non-decreasing order after the insertion.

A counterexample is when the input is:

```
2
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer is `3`. The program's approach does not work because it does not consider the case where the new problem is inserted at the end of the array `a`, which would require removing the last element of `a` and then inserting the new problem.

A correct approach would be to insert the new problem at the correct position in the sorted array `a` and then remove the last element of `a`. This can be achieved by using a binary search to find the correct position for the new problem and then inserting it at that position.
