Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of lines, each containing two integers. It categorizes these integers into three groups based on their first value (1, 2, or 3), and then finds the smallest integer that is not present in the third group and is within the range of the maximum value in the first group and the minimum value in the second group. It prints this integer to standard output for each test case.**
