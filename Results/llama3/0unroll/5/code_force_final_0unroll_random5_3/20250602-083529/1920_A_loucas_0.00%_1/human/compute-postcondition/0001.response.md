Output State: **The loop will execute `loop` number of times. In each iteration, it will read `innerLoop` number of lines from stdin, where `innerLoop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). For each line, it will read two integers `x` and `a`, where `x` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The loop will then process these inputs and print an integer `num` to stdout. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged.**
