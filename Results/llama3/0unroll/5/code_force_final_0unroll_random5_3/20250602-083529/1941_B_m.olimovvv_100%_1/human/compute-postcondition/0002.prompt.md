You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer, then a series of pairs of inputs where the first input of each pair is an integer and the second input is a space-separated list of integers. The first integer is a non-negative integer and represents the number of pairs of inputs that follow. The first integer of each pair is a non-negative integer and represents the length of the list of integers that follows. The list of integers is a list of non-negative integers.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each indicating whether the corresponding list of integers can be reduced to zeros by the given operations.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
