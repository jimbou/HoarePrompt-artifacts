Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation allows Rudolf to choose an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

However, the program does not correctly implement this operation. It subtracts b[i] * 2 from b[i + 1] and b[i] from b[i + 2], which is not equivalent to the operation described in the problem.

For example, if the input is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2], the program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because Rudolf can make all the elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
