Functionality: **The function reads multiple pairs of inputs from stdin, where each pair consists of an integer and a list of integers. For each pair, it checks if the list can be reduced to zeros by repeatedly subtracting twice the current element from the next element and the current element from the element after next, starting from the first element. If the list can be reduced to zeros, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for the specified number of pairs, printing a 'YES' or 'NO' for each pair.**
