Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the given operations.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program iterates over the input list `b` from the first element to the third last element (inclusive). For each element `b[i]`, it subtracts `2*b[i]` from the next element `b[i+1]` and `b[i]` from the element after that `b[i+2]`. This is equivalent to applying the operation described in the problem statement.

2. After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the list `b` are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO', because it's not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero. If they are zero, it prints 'YES'.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the input list has less than three elements. In this case, the loop doesn't execute, and the program checks the last two elements of the list (which are the only elements in this case). If they are zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. The program also correctly handles the case where the input list has three or more elements, but the first element is negative. In this case, the loop executes, but the program breaks out of the loop as soon as it encounters a negative element, and prints 'NO'.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the given operations.

Correctness: **True**
