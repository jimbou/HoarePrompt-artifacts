Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement and checks if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using this operation.

The program iterates over the array from the first element to the third last element. For each element, it subtracts twice the current element from the next element and the current element from the element after next. This is equivalent to applying the operation described in the problem statement.

After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO', because it's not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the operation. If the last two elements are zero, it prints 'YES', because it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the operation.

The program correctly handles the case where the input array has less than three elements, because the loop will not be executed in this case, and the program will correctly print 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array has three or more elements, because the loop will be executed, and the program will correctly check if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the operation.

Correctness: **True**
