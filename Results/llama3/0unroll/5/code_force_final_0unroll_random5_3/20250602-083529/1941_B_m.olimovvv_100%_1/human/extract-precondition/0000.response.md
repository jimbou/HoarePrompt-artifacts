Precondition: **stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer, then a series of pairs of inputs where the first input of each pair is an integer and the second input is a space-separated list of integers. The first integer is a non-negative integer and represents the number of pairs of inputs that follow. The first integer of each pair is a non-negative integer and represents the length of the list of integers that follows. The list of integers is a list of non-negative integers.**
