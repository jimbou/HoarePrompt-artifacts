Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

Function 1 calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a given list of integers. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty, which can be achieved by rearranging the elements in a specific order.

The correct approach is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This will give the maximum beauty of the array.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It applies Function 1 to each array and stores the results in a list. However, since Function 1 is incorrect, the results will also be incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
