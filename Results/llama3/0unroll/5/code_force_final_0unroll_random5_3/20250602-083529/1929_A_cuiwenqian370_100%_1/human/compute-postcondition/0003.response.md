Output State: The loop will execute 't' times, and after each execution, the 'index' will be incremented by 'n+1' where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. The 'results' list will be populated with the results of 'func_1' applied to each array. The 'array' will be overwritten in each iteration with a new list of 'n' integers. The 'stdin' will remain empty as it is not used in the loop.
