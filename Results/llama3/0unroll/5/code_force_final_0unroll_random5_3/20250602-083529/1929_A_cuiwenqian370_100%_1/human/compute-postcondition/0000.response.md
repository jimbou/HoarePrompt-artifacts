Output State: **array is a list of non-negative integers, t is an integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**

Explanation:

* The first line, `input = sys.stdin.read`, assigns the `read` method of `sys.stdin` to the variable `input`. This allows the program to read input from standard input.
* The second line, `data = input().split()`, reads a line of input from standard input and splits it into a list of words using whitespace as the delimiter. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `data`. Since `array` is a list of non-negative integers, it is likely that the input is a space-separated list of integers. Stdin is now empty.
* The third line, `t = int(data[0])`, converts the first element of the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`.
* The fourth line, `index = 1`, assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`.
* The fifth line, `results = []`, creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `results`.

Overall, the code reads a line of input from standard input, extracts the first integer from the input, and assigns it to the variable `t`. It also initializes the variables `index` and `results` to 1 and an empty list, respectively. The original state of `array` remains unchanged.
