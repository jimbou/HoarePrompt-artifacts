Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Function 1 sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order, which maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

Function 2 reads the input data, processes each test case, and calls Function 1 to calculate the beauty of each array. It then prints the results.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses a valid approach to solve it. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
