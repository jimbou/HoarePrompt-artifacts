Output State: The loop will execute t times, and after each iteration, the index will be incremented by n+1, where n is the number of elements in the array. The results list will contain t elements, each of which is the result of func_1(array) for the corresponding array. The array will be updated with a new list of integers in each iteration. The stdin will remain empty as it is not used in the loop.
