The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be in a specific format, where the first line contains the number of test cases 't', followed by 't' lines, each containing the size of an array 'n' and 'n' non-negative integers. The function applies another function 'func_1' to each array and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.
