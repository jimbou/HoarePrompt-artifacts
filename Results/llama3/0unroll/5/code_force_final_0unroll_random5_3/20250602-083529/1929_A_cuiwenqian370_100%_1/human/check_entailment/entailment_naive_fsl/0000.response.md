Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.

The function `func_2` reads the input from the standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty of each array. It then prints the results.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles arrays of different lengths, arrays with duplicate elements, and arrays with negative elements correctly. The use of the `abs` function ensures that the beauty is always non-negative, as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the problem description.
