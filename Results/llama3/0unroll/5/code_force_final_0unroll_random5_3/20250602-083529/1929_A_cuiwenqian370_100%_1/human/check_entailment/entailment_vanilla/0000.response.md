Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Function 1, `func_1`, sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct because sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input data from standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results. This function is also correct as it properly handles the input and output.

However, there is a minor issue with Function 2. The `input` function is being reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, which is not necessary and can be confusing. The original `input` function can be used instead.

Despite this minor issue, the overall correctness of the program is not affected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
