Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Function `func_1` calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a given list of integers. This function sorts the array first, which is a crucial step in finding the maximum beauty. By sorting the array, the function ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It applies `func_1` to each array and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.

Since `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty of an array, and `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each array and prints the results, the program as a whole is correct.

Correctness: **True**
