Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each with two integers. The range of `t-1` is from 0 to 99 because one line of input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
