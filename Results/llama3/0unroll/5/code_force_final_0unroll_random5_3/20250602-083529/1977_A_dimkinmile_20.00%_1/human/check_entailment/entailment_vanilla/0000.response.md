Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the tower.

2. The given program defines a function `func_1()` that takes two integers n and m as input, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. The function checks if n is greater than or equal to m. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. The main part of the program reads an integer `kreker` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates over a range of `kreker` and calls the `func_1()` function for each iteration.

5. However, there is a logical error in the program. The condition `n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. The correct condition should be `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0`, because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, and the difference between n and m must be even.

6. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
