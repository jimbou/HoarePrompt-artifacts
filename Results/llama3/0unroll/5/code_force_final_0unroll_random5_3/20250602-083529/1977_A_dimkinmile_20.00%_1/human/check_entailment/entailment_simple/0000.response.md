Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program checks if n is greater than or equal to m. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee the possibility of having a tower with m cubes after n moves. The correct condition should be that the difference between n and m is even. This is because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs, and if the difference between n and m is even, he can make the necessary number of moves to end up with m cubes.

For example, if n = 5 and m = 3, the program will print 'Yes', but it's not possible to have a tower with 3 cubes after 5 moves. Nikita can add 3 cubes and then remove 2, but he can't add or remove another cube to end up with 3 cubes.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
