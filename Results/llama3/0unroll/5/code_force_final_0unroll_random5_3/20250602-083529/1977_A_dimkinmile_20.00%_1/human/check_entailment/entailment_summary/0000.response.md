Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program uses a simple logic: if the number of moves (n) is greater than or equal to the number of cubes (m), it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build the tower. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

This logic is correct because if n is greater than or equal to m, Nikita can put m cubes on top of the tower in m moves, and then remove the remaining (n-m) cubes in the remaining (n-m) moves. This way, the tower will have exactly m cubes after n moves.

However, the program is missing the outer loop that reads the number of test cases (kreker) and calls the function func_1() for each test case. The correct program should be:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

Correctness: **True**
