Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if n is odd and m is even, the program will print 'Yes' even though it is not possible to obtain a tower with m cubes after n moves. This is because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of cubes in the tower will always be odd after an odd number of moves.

A correct solution would need to take into account the parity of n and m, and print 'Yes' only if they have the same parity.
