Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 10^4, which is the number of test cases. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The constraints on `n` and `a_i` remain the same as in the initial state.
