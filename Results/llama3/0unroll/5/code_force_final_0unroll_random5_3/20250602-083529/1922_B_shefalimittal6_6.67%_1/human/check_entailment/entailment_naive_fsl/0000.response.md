Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. 

The issue lies in the line where it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length. The current implementation adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length multiplied by the total number of sticks of different lengths. However, this is incorrect because it counts the cases where the third stick is also of the same length multiple times.

For example, if we have 3 sticks of length 2 and 2 sticks of length 3, the program will count the case where we choose 2 sticks of length 2 and 1 stick of length 3 twice, once for each stick of length 2.

To fix this, we need to subtract the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length from the total count. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        res = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
                if cnt >= 4:
                    res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * (cnt - 2)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        print(res)
```

This corrected code first calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length, then calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length, and finally adds these two counts together.
