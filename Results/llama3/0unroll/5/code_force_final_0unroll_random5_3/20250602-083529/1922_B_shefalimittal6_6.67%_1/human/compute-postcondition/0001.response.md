Output State: **The loop will have executed t times, with the value of t being an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin will be empty, as all test cases will have been processed. The output will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for a test case. The number of integers in the output will be equal to t-1. The value of n will be the last value read from stdin, and the value of num_of_lens will be a dictionary containing the count of each number in the last test case. The value of nums will be a list of integers representing the last test case. The value of res will be the result of the calculation for the last test case.**
