Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It calculates the number of triplets and pairs that can be formed from the integers in each test case, taking into account the frequency of each integer. The function then prints the total count of triplets and pairs for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and produces a series of output integers, each representing the result of the calculation for a test case.**
