#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters consisting of '0's and '1's.
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum number of cats that need to be added or removed, which is the maximum of the number of positions where s1 has '0' and s2 has '1' and the number of positions where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the maximum number of cats that need to be added or removed to make two binary strings of equal length identical, by comparing the strings character by character and counting the differences.
