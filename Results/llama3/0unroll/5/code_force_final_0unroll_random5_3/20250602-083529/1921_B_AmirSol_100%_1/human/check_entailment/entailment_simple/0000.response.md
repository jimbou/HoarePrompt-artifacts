Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial position. The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added and removed, and returns the maximum of these two numbers. This is because the number of operations required is the maximum of the number of cats that need to be added and the number of cats that need to be removed.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of cats to be added is greater than the number of cats to be removed, and vice versa. It also correctly handles the case where the number of cats to be added is equal to the number of cats to be removed.

The program assumes that the input strings `s1` and `s2` are of the same length `n`, and that they consist only of '0's and '1's. This is a valid assumption based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
