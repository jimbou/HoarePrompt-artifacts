The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of the values in `cnt` by 3.
`cnt` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in list `a` and the values are their respective counts.
Since the exact values in list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum of the integer divisions.
Output: **sum of the integer divisions of the counts of unique integers in list a by 3**
