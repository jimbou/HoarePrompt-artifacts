The code snippet provided reads input from stdin for a single test case. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. The third line initializes `ans` to 0. The fourth line initializes `cnt` as an empty dictionary.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
