Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on a set of 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (num) and initializing an empty list (out) to store the results.

2. The program then iterates over the range of the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the value of n (the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n) and the 2n integers.

3. The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order.

4. It then iterates over the range of n and selects the minimum of each pair of adjacent integers (list1[2 * i]) and adds it to a new list (list2).

5. The program calculates the sum of the integers in list2 and appends it to the out list.

6. Finally, the program prints the results stored in the out list.

The program's logic is correct. By sorting the list of integers and selecting the minimum of each pair of adjacent integers, the program ensures that the maximum final score is achieved. The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
