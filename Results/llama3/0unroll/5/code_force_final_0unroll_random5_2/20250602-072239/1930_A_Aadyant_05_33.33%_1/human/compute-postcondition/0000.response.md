Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line per test case, num is a string containing the first line of each test case, out is an empty list**.

The first line of the code, `num = input()`, reads the first line of each test case from stdin and assigns it to the variable `num`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two lines, this line reduces the number of lines in stdin by one for each test case. The value of `num` is a string containing the first line of each test case, which is a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) — the number of test cases.

The second line, `out = []`, initializes an empty list `out`. This line does not affect any other variables or stdin.

Therefore, the final state is that stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line per test case, `num` is a string containing the first line of each test case, and `out` is an empty list.
