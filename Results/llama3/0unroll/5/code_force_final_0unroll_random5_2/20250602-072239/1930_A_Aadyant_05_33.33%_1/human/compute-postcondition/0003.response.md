Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of integers written on a whiteboard. It sorts these integers, selects the elements at even indices, sums them up, and prints the result for each test case. The function processes all test cases, emptying the standard input, and produces a list of sums, one for each test case, which are then printed to the console.**
