stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n. The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.
