Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the index of the first element in `arr` that is different from its previous element (or 0 if all elements are the same) and the index of the first element minus 1, and 0.**

In this output state, `j` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is different from its previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same. The index of the first element is represented by `i`, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is implied to be 0 since it is the first element. Therefore, `j - i - 1` represents the difference between the index of the first element that is different from its previous element and the index of the first element minus 1. The `max` function returns the maximum value between this difference and 0.
