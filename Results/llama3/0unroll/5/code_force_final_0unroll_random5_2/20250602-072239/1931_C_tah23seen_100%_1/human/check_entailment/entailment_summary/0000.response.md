Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles (or operations) required to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function `func_1` works by first finding the longest sequence of identical elements at the beginning and end of the array. If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the maximum number of consecutive identical elements that can be removed from the end of the array. Otherwise, it returns the maximum number of consecutive identical elements that can be removed from the start or end of the array.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of burles to make all elements equal, not the maximum number of consecutive identical elements that can be removed. The correct approach would be to find the most frequent element in the array and calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal to that element.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
