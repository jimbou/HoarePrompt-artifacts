Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of "burles" (operations) required to make all elements of an array equal. The operation involves selecting three integers i, j, and x, and assigning all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles.

The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles required. The function first finds the index `i` of the first element in the array that is different from its next element, or the second last index of the array if all elements are the same. It then finds the index `j` of the first element in the array that is different from its previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same.

If the first and last elements of the array are the same, the function returns the maximum value between the difference of `j` and `i` minus 1, and 0. This is because if the first and last elements are the same, we can make all elements equal by replacing the elements between `i` and `j` with the first element.

If the first and last elements are not the same, the function returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, and 0, where n is the length of the array. This is because if the first and last elements are not the same, we can make all elements equal by replacing the elements between the start and `i`, or between `j` and the end of the array, with the first or last element, respectively.

The program then reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements, and prints the result of calling `func_1` with the array as input.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of an array equal. It handles the cases where the first and last elements are the same and where they are different, and returns the correct result in both cases. The program also correctly reads the input and prints the output for each test case.
