#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: i is the index of the first element in arr that is different from its next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state is that the variable `i` will point to the first element in the array that is different from its next element. If all elements in the array are the same, `i` will point to the second last element of the array.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from its previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state is that the variable `j` will point to the first element in the array that is different from its previous element. If all elements in the array are the same, `j` will be 0.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between the difference of the index of the first element in `arr` that is different from its previous element (or 0 if all elements are the same) and the index of the first element minus 1, and 0.
    #State: *j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from its previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same. The first element of arr is not equal to the last element of arr
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, and 0, where j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from its previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same, and n is the length of arr.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum number of consecutive identical elements in a list that can be removed to make the first and last elements of the list different. It takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum number of removable consecutive identical elements. If all elements in the list are the same, it returns 0. If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the maximum number of consecutive identical elements that can be removed from the end of the list. Otherwise, it returns the maximum number of consecutive identical elements that can be removed from the start or end of the list.
