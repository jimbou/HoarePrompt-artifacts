Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The program will return 5, but the correct answer is 6. The program is not correctly implementing the operation of assigning all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x. 

The program is only checking if the first and last elements of the array are equal, and if they are, it returns the maximum of j - i - 1 and 0. If they are not equal, it returns the maximum of min(n - i - 1, j) and 0. This is not the correct logic to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to find the most frequent element in the array and then calculate the minimum number of operations required to make all elements equal to this most frequent element. 

Here is a correct implementation of the function:

def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    freq = {}
    for num in arr:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1
        else:
            freq[num] = 1
    max_freq = max(freq.values())
    return n - max_freq
