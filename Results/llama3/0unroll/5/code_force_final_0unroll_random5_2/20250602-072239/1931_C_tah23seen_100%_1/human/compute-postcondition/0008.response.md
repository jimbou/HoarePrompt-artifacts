Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, and 0, where j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from its previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same, and n is the length of arr.**

In this output state, the program returns a value that is at least 0 and at most the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j. The value of j is determined by the array arr, and it is either the index of the first element that is different from its previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same. The value of n is the length of arr. The program returns this value after comparing it with 0 and returning the maximum of the two.
