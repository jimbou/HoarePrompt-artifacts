Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the total number of ways to choose three numbers from each test case that sum up to the length of the test case. It accepts a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list of two elements: an integer n and a list of n integers. The function processes each test case, counts the occurrences of each number, and calculates the total number of ways to choose three numbers that sum up to n. The results are stored in a list and printed out. The original test cases remain unchanged.**
