Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. 

The program first counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary. Then, it iterates over the counts and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (if the count is 3 or more) and the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length (if the count is 2 or more). The total count of sticks is also updated in each iteration.

The program correctly handles the cases where the count of a stick length is less than 3, in which case it does not contribute to the total number of ways to choose 3 sticks.

The program also correctly handles the case where the count of a stick length is 1, in which case it does not contribute to the total number of ways to choose 3 sticks.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
