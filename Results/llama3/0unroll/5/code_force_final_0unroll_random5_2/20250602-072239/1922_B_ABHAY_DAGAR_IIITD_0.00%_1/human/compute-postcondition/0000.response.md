Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a list of two elements: the first element is an integer n, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 0 <= a_i <= n. `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `test_cases` remains unchanged, still holding a list of test cases with the specified properties. The new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list, ready to store results from processing the test cases.
