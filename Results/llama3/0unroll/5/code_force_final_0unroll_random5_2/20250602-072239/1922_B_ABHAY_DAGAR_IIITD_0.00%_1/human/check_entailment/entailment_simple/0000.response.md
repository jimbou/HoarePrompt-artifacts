Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It iterates over each test case, reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.
3. It creates a dictionary `num_of_lens` to store the frequency of each stick length.
4. It calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. This is done by iterating over the values of `num_of_lens` and adding the number of ways to choose three sticks of the same length (if the count is at least 3) and the number of ways to choose two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length (if the count is at least 2).
5. It appends the calculated result to the `results` list.
6. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
