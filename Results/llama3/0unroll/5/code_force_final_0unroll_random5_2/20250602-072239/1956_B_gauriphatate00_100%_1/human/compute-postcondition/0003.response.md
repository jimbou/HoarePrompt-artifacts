Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from 1 to `n` and the values are the number of times each integer appears in the list `a`, and `max_score` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `n`, and `count_a` remain unchanged, as the code only introduces a new variable `max_score` and assigns it the value 0. The properties of `a`, `n`, and `count_a` are still valid, and `max_score` is now a part of the state with a value of 0.
