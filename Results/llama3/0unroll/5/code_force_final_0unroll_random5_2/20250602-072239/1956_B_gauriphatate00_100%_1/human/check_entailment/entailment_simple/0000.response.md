Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The program iterates over the list `a` and counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to `n`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer appears exactly twice in the list `a`. If it does, it increments the `max_score` by 1. Finally, the program returns the `max_score`, which is the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

The program correctly assumes that the input list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n` and that each integer appears at most twice in the list. The program also correctly handles the case where an integer appears only once in the list, in which case it does not increment the `max_score`.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
