Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, given the cards in their hand and the optimal strategy of their opponent.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes the list of cards `a` and the number of cards `n` as input. It first creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each number in the list `a`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks if each number is present in the dictionary `count_a`. If a number is present and its count is 2, it increments the `max_score` by 1.

The program then calls this function for each test case and appends the result to the list `results`. Finally, it prints each result in the list.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy to maximize the player's score. By counting the occurrences of each number in the list `a` and checking for numbers with a count of 2, the program identifies the numbers that can be played to score points. The `max_score` variable keeps track of the maximum number of points that can be scored.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will match the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
