    return max_score
    #The program returns the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers from 1 to n and returns the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list. It counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and then calculates the maximum score by summing up the counts of integers that appear exactly twice. The function returns this maximum score, which represents the number of integers that meet the specified condition.
