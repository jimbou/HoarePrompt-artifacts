Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` as input, and returns the maximum score that can be achieved.

The program first counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` using a dictionary `count_a`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer appears exactly twice in the list `a`. If an integer appears exactly twice, it increments the `max_score` by 1.

The program correctly assumes that the input list `a` contains integers from 1 to `n`, and each integer appears at most twice in the list. The function returns the maximum score, which is the number of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
