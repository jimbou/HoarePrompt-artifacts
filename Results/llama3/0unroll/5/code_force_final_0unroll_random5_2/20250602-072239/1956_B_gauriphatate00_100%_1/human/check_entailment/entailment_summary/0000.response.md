Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally in the card game. The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` and then calculates the maximum score by summing up the counts of integers that appear exactly twice. This is because a player can score a point only if there is already a card with the same integer on the table, and this can happen only if the player has two cards with the same integer.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, and it does not have any syntax or logical errors. The execution summary also correctly describes the behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
