The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676). 

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the first line of the stdin. The remaining lines of the stdin are still present. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 676 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input (t-1 lines remaining)**
