The function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and k. It then generates a string s consisting of k lowercase alphabets starting from 'a' and prints t lines of output, each containing the string s repeated n times if k is 1, or repeated twice if n is not 1 and k is not 1, resulting in t lines of output in the standard output.
