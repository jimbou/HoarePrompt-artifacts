Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the sequence of cards, dividing the remaining cards by 2 in each iteration, and checks if the k-th card is within the current range of cards. If it is, it calculates the position of the k-th card within that range and prints the corresponding card number.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as when k is 1 or when n is a power of 2. The use of integer division (//) and multiplication (*) ensures that the program works correctly for large values of n and k.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided work correctly.
