This function reads a series of input values from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing two integers n and k. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the values of n and k, and prints the result to standard output. The function does not modify the input values of t, n, or k. The output consists of t lines, each containing a single integer representing the calculated result for the corresponding input values of n and k.
