#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer
    return int(putin())
    #The program returns an integer that was provided as input through stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it as an integer value, effectively passing the input integer through the program without modification.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: putin() is a function that returns a string of space-separated integers.
    return map(int, putin().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers. These integers are obtained by splitting the string returned by the putin() function into space-separated integers and then converting each integer to an integer type.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes no parameters and returns a map object containing integers. The integers are obtained from a string of space-separated integers returned by the putin() function, which is then split and converted to integer type. The function effectively converts a string of space-separated integers into a map object of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar and sec_arr are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob respectively.
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
        
    #State: Output State: `main_arr` and `sec_arr` are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob respectively, `sub_summ` is the sum of the prices of all items for Alice.
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: Output State: The `sub_summ` variable now holds the sum of the prices of all items for Alice where the total price of the item for both Alice and Bob is greater than or equal to 0. The `main_arr` and `sec_arr` lists remain unchanged.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns the sum of the prices of all items for Alice where the total price of the item for both Alice and Bob is greater than or equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates and returns the sum of prices of items for Alice, considering only items where the total price for both Alice and Bob is greater than or equal to 0. It takes two lists of pairs of integers as input, representing prices of items for Alice and Bob, and returns the calculated sum. The input lists remain unchanged.
