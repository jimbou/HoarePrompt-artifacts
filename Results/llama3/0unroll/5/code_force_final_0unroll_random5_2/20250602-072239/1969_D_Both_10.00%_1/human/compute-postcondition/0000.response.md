Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the prices of an item for Alice and Bob respectively, `sub_summ` is 0**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `sub_summ` and initialized it to 0. The values of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged, as they are lists of pairs of integers representing the prices of items for Alice and Bob, respectively.
