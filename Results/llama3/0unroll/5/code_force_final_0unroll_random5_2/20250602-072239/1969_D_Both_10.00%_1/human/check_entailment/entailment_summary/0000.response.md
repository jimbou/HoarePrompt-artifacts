Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing Alice's profit in a game where she buys items from a shop and sells them to Bob. The program consists of multiple functions that work together to achieve this goal.

Function 1 reads an integer from standard input and returns it as an integer value, which represents the number of test cases.

Function 2 takes no parameters and returns a map object containing integers. It is used to read the number of items (n) and the number of items Bob can take for free (k) from standard input.

Function 3 calculates the sum of prices of items for Alice, considering only items where the total price for both Alice and Bob is greater than or equal to 0. It takes two lists of pairs of integers as input, representing prices of items for Alice and Bob, and returns the calculated sum.

The main program uses these functions to solve the problem. It first reads the number of test cases (t) using Function 1. Then, for each test case, it reads the number of items (n) and the number of items Bob can take for free (k) using Function 2. It then reads the prices of items for Alice and Bob using Function 2.

The program then sorts the items based on their prices for Bob in ascending order. It then uses a heap data structure (k_arr) to store the k items with the highest prices for Bob. The program then iterates through the remaining items and calculates the maximum profit for Alice by considering the items in k_arr and the remaining items.

The program uses Function 3 to calculate the sum of prices of items for Alice, considering only items where the total price for both Alice and Bob is greater than or equal to 0. It then updates the maximum profit for Alice if the calculated sum is greater than the current maximum profit.

Finally, the program prints the maximum profit for Alice for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and maximizes Alice's profit. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
