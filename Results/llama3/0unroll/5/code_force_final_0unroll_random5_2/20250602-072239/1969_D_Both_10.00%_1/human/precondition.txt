stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; 0 <= k <= n). The second line contains two lists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9).
