Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit and minimize Bob's profit. The function `func_3` does not correctly calculate the profit, as it simply sums up the values of `val_a[0]` and `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` without considering the conditions and constraints of the problem.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when `k` is greater than `n`. In this case, the program does not handle the situation where Bob can take all items for free, and the profit calculation is incorrect.

Additionally, the program does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. The correct approach would be to sort the items based on the difference between `b_i` and `a_i`, and then select the items that maximize the profit for Alice while minimizing the profit for Bob.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
