Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The program first checks if all elements in both arrays are the same, in which case the maximum difference is 0.
2. It then sorts both arrays, with array a in ascending order and array c in descending order.
3. The program uses two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning and end of array a, respectively. It calculates the absolute difference between the current elements of array a and array c at indices i and j, and adds the maximum of these two differences to the total difference ans.
4. The program then moves the pointer that corresponds to the smaller difference one step forward.
5. This process continues until all elements in array a have been processed, and the maximum total difference D is printed.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when all elements in both arrays are the same, or when the length of array a is 1. The logic is sound, and the implementation is correct.
