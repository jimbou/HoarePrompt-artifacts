Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the two sorted lists, a and c, for each test case. The maximum absolute difference is calculated by comparing the absolute differences between the elements at the current positions in the two lists and the elements at the mirrored positions from the ends of the lists. The output will be a list of these sums, one for each test case.**
