This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates and prints the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two sorted lists a and c for each test case. If the lists contain identical elements, it prints 0. If a list contains only one element, it prints the maximum absolute difference between that element and the maximum or minimum element of the other list. Otherwise, it iterates through the lists, comparing absolute differences between elements at current and mirrored positions, and prints the sum of these maximum differences.
