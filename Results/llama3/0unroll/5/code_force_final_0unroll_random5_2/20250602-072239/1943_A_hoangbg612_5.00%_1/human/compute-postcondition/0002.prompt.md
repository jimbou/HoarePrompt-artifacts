You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        N.sort()
        
        cur = -1
        
        M = {}
        
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        
        print(cur)
        
    #State: The output state is the maximum number of consecutive integers that can be formed from the input list, considering the frequency of each integer. The loop iterates T times, and for each iteration, it reads the size of the list S and the list of integers N. It sorts the list, initializes a dictionary M to store the frequency of each integer, and a variable cur to keep track of the maximum consecutive integer. It then iterates over the sorted list, updating the frequency of each integer in M and updating cur if the current integer is greater than cur. If the sum of the frequencies in M is equal to S, it increments cur. Finally, it iterates from 0 to cur and prints the maximum consecutive integer that can be formed.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
