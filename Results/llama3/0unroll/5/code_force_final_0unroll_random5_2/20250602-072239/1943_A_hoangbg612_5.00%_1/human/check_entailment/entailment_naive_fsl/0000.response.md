Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program sorts the input array `N` and then iterates through it, keeping track of the current number `cur` and a dictionary `M` that stores the count of each number. The program correctly implements the game's rules, where Alice picks a number and appends it to her array `c`, and Bob picks a number and deletes it from the array `a`. The program also correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game.

The program handles the case where the input array `N` contains duplicate numbers, and it correctly breaks the loop when it finds a number that is greater than `cur + 1`. The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of the counts of all numbers in the dictionary `M` is equal to the size of the input array `S`, in which case it increments `cur` by 1.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. Therefore, the program is correct.
