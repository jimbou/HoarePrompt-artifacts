This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It determines the maximum number of consecutive integers that can be formed from the input list, considering the frequency of each integer. The function iterates over each test case, sorts the list, and updates the frequency of each integer. It then finds the maximum consecutive integer that can be formed and prints it. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
