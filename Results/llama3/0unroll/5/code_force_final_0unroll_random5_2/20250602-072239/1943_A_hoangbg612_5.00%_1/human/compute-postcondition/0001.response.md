Output State: **The output state is the maximum number of consecutive integers that can be formed from the input list, considering the frequency of each integer. The loop iterates T times, and for each iteration, it reads the size of the list S and the list of integers N. It sorts the list, initializes a dictionary M to store the frequency of each integer, and a variable cur to keep track of the maximum consecutive integer. It then iterates over the sorted list, updating the frequency of each integer in M and updating cur if the current integer is greater than cur. If the sum of the frequencies in M is equal to S, it increments cur. Finally, it iterates from 0 to cur and prints the maximum consecutive integer that can be formed.**
