Reasoning:

The given program is almost correct, but it has a small mistake. The function `func_1(n)` is defined to calculate the sum of the digits of a number `n`, which is correct. However, in the main loop, the program is calling `func_1(i)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, instead of from 1 to `n`. This means that the program is missing the sum of the digits of the number `n` itself.

Correctness: **False**
