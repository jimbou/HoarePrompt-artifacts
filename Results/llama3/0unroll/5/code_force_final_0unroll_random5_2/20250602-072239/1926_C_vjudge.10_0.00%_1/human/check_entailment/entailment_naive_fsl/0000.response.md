Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The issue lies in the fact that the program is adding the sum of the digits of each number from 0 to n, instead of from 1 to n.

In the given code, the loop `for i in range(n):` starts from 0, not from 1. Therefore, the sum of the digits of 0 is also being added to the total sum, which is incorrect.

For example, when n = 12, the program will calculate the sum of the digits of numbers from 0 to 12, instead of from 1 to 12. This will result in an incorrect answer.

To fix this issue, the loop should start from 1, not from 0. The correct code should be:

```
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
```

This corrected code will correctly calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.
