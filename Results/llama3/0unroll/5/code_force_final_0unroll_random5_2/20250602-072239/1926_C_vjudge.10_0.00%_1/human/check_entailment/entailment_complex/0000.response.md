Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is iterating from 0 to `n-1` (since the range function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value) and calculating the sum of the digits for each number in this range. But the problem statement requires the program to calculate the sum of the digits for numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

To fix this error, the program should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) instead of from 0 to `n-1`. This can be achieved by changing the range function to `range(1, n+1)`.

Correctness: **False**
