Reasoning:

1. The problem asks us to find the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits.
2. The given program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number `n` by converting the number to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing them up.
3. The program then reads the number of test cases `N` and iterates over each test case.
4. For each test case, it reads the largest number `n` that Vladislav writes and initializes a variable `soma` to 0.
5. The program then iterates from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) and for each number `i`, it calls the function `func_1(i)` to calculate the sum of its digits and adds it to the `soma` variable.
6. After iterating over all numbers, the program prints the final value of `soma`, which is the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav's replacement.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The variable `soma` is not reset to 0 for each test case, so the sum of the numbers on the board for each test case is added to the sum of the previous test cases. This means that the program will produce incorrect results for all test cases except the first one.

Correctness: **False**
