Reasoning:

The given program is almost correct, but it has a logical error. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to calculate the sum of the digits of a given integer. However, in the main part of the program, the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value), but it should iterate from 1 to `n` (inclusive) as per the problem statement.

To fix this, the loop should be modified to `for i in range(1, n+1):`. This will ensure that the function `func_1` is called for all integers from 1 to `n`, and the sum of their digits is correctly calculated.

Correctness: **False**
