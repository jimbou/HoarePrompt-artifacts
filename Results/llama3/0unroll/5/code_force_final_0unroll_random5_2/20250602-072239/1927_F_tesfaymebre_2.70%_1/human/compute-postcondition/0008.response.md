Functionality: **This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) in a graph to find a path that includes a specific node (node_v). It accepts as input the current node (curr), its parent node (parent), the graph represented as a list of lists, a list of colors to keep track of visited nodes, the target node (node_v), and the current path. The function returns a list of nodes representing the path that includes node_v if found, or an empty list if no such path exists. The function modifies the colors list to mark visited nodes and updates the path as it traverses the graph.**
