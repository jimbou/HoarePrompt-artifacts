Output: **The loop has iterated over all edges in the graph, and the DSU object has been updated accordingly. The minimum edge weight _min_edge has been updated to the minimum weight of all edges in the graph, and the nodes node_u and node_v have been updated to the nodes of the minimum edge. The DSU object dsu has been updated to reflect the union of all nodes in the graph. The variables n, m, graph, and edges remain unchanged. A list of colors with n+1 elements, all initialized to 0, has been created. The dfs function has been called with node_u as the starting node, -1 as the parent node, and an empty list as the third argument, but its return value has not been assigned to any variable. The minimum edge weight _min_edge and the length of the result list res are being printed, and the contents of the result list res are being printed**
