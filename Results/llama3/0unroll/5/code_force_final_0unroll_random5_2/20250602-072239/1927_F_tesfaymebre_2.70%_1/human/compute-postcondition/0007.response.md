Output State: **The program returns an empty list. The loop has iterated over all neighbors of the current node without finding a path that includes node_v. The state of the other variables (graph, colors, node_v, and path) remains unchanged, but the color of the current node (curr) is now 2, indicating that it has been visited.**
