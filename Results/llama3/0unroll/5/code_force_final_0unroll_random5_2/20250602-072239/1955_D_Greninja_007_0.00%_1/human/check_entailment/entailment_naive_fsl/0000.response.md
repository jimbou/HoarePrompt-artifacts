Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It uses a sliding window approach to count the number of good subarrays in array `a`. The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to efficiently count the frequency of elements in both arrays `a` and `b`.

The program first initializes a counter for the frequency of elements in array `b` and a counter for the frequency of elements in the first window of array `a`. It then calculates the number of matches between the two counters.

The program then iterates over the rest of array `a`, updating the window counter and the number of matches at each step. If the number of matches is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the count of good subarrays.

Finally, the program returns the count of good subarrays.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when `k` is equal to `m`, when `m` is equal to `n`, and when the elements of array `a` are not unique.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
