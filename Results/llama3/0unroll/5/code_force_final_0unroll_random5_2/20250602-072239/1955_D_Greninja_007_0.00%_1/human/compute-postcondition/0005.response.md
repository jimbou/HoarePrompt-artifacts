Postcondition: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: good_subarrays is the total number of subarrays of length m in list a that have at least k matches with list b, plus 1 if the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in the last m elements of list a and its frequency in list b is greater than or equal to k, window_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of list a, matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in the last m elements of list a and its frequency in list b.**
