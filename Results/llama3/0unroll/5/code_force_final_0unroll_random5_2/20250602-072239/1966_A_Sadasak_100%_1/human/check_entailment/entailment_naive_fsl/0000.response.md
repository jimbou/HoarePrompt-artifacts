Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the frequency of a number is equal to k, and if so, it prints k-1. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

A correct approach would be to find the maximum number of operations that can be performed, and then calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand. This can be done by dividing the frequency of each number by k and rounding up to the nearest integer, and then summing up these values.

For example, consider the input:

5 3
4 1 1 4 4

The program will print 5, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 2, because we can perform two operations: first, we can exchange three 4's for two 4's, and then we can exchange two 1's for one 1.

A correct implementation of the program would be:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count + k - 1) // k
    print(min_cards)
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.
