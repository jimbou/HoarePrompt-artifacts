#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, k is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100.
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: Output State: The frequency_table dictionary contains the frequency of each integer in the arr list, with a maximum frequency of k. The arr list and the value of k remain unchanged.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns the frequency_table dictionary, which contains the frequency of each integer in the arr list, with a maximum frequency of k. The returned dictionary is unchanged from its initial state, still containing the frequency of each integer in the arr list, with no frequency exceeding k.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a frequency table of integers in a given list, capping the frequency of each integer at a specified maximum value. It takes a list of integers and an integer as input, and returns a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer, limited to the specified maximum. The original list and maximum value remain unchanged.
