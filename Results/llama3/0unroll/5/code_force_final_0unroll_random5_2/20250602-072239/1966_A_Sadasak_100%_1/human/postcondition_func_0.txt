This function generates a frequency table of integers in a given list, capping the frequency of each integer at a specified maximum value. It takes a list of integers and an integer as input, and returns a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer, limited to the specified maximum. The original list and maximum value remain unchanged.
