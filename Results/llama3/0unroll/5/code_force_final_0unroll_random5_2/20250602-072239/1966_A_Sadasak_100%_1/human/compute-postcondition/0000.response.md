Output State: **arr is a list of integers, k is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, frequency_table is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged, and a new variable `frequency_table` is introduced, which is an empty dictionary. The range of `k` is still between 2 and 100, inclusive.
