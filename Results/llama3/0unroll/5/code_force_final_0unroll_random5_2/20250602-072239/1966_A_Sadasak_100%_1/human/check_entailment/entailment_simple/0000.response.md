Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each number in the list `nums` with a maximum frequency of `k`. However, the function is not correctly implemented. It only checks if the frequency of a number exceeds `k` and if so, sets it to `k`. This is not the correct way to calculate the frequency of each number with a maximum frequency of `k`.

Moreover, the main program does not correctly use the frequency table returned by `func_1`. It only checks if `k` is in the frequency table values, and if so, prints `k-1`. This is not the correct way to find the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations.

The correct approach would be to calculate the frequency of each number in the list `nums` with a maximum frequency of `k`, and then find the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand by iterating over the frequency table and calculating the minimum number of cards that can be left for each number.

Correctness: **False**
