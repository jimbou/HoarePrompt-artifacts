The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the integers to find pairs of equal elements and prints them in a specific order. If there are remaining elements without pairs, they are printed at the end. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
