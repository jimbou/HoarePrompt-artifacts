#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        l = [0] * n

    #State: The output state is a series of pairs of integers, where each pair represents the indices of the elements in the array 'a' that are equal to each other. The pairs are printed in the order they appear in the array 'a'. If there are any remaining elements that do not have a pair, they are printed at the end.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes the integers to find pairs of equal elements and prints them in a specific order. If there are remaining elements without pairs, they are printed at the end. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
