Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array `a` contains duplicate elements in the first half that are not present in the second half. In this case, the program will print the same element twice in the first line of output, which is not a valid solution according to the problem description.

For example, if the input is:

```
4
2 1
1 1 2 2
```

The program will output:

```
1 1
2 2
```

However, this is not a valid solution because the first line of output should be a subset of the first half of the input array, and the second line of output should be a subset of the second half of the input array. In this case, the first line of output contains two 1's, which are not present in the first half of the input array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
