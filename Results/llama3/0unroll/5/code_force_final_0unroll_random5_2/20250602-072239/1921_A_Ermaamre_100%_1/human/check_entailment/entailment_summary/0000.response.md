Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners. It extracts the x-coordinates, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (which represents the length of the side of the square), and then prints the square of this difference (which represents the area of the square).

The program's logic is correct because the area of a square can be calculated as the square of the length of its side. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) gives the length of the side.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads the input correctly and prints the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
