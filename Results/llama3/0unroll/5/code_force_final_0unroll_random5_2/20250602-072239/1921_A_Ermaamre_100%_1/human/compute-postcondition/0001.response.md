Output State: The loop has executed t times, and for each test case, it has printed the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the square. The input buffer (stdin) is now empty, as all t test cases have been read and processed. The variable 't' still holds its initial value, but it is no longer relevant as the loop has finished executing.
