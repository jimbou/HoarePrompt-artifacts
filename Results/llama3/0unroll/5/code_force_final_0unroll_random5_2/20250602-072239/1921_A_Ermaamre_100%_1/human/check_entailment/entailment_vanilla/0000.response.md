Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and its area is strictly greater than 0.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square into a 2D list `a`. It then extracts the x-coordinates of the corners into a list `x`.

4. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`) and prints the square of this difference (`dx * dx`) as the area of the square.

5. The program assumes that the input coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Given this assumption, the program correctly calculates the area of the square.

6. The program does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases, but the problem statement guarantees that the input will be valid.

7. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
