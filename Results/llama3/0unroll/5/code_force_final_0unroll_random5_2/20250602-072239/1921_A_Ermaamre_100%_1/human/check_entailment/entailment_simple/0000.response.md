Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` correctly.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square correctly.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates of the corners correctly.
4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates correctly, which represents the length of the side of the square.
5. It calculates the area of the square by squaring the length of the side correctly.
6. It prints the area of the square for each test case correctly.

The program assumes that the input is valid, as stated in the problem description. It does not handle invalid inputs, but that is not required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
