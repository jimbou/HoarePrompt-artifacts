Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case has four lines, each containing two integers `x_i` and `y_i`, which represent the coordinates of the corners of a square. The values of `x_i` and `y_i` are between -1000 and 1000.
