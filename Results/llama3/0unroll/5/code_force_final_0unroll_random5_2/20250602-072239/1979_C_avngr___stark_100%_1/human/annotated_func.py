#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of two positive integers a and b, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers a and b, which is the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of at least one integer
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `numbers` is a list of at least one integer, `result` is the result of applying `func_1` to the first integer in the list `numbers` and each subsequent integer in the list `numbers`, in order.
    return result
    #The program returns the result of applying `func_1` to the first integer in the list `numbers` and each subsequent integer in the list `numbers`, in order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function applies a given function (`func_1`) cumulatively to a list of integers (`numbers`), starting with the first integer, and returns the final result. The function takes a list of integers and a function as input, and returns a single value, which is the result of applying the given function to the first integer and each subsequent integer in the list, in order.
