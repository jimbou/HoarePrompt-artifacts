Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. However, the provided program does not attempt to solve this problem. It defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to calculating the least common multiple of a list of numbers, but it does not use these functions to solve the problem described.

For example, if the input is `3` and the multipliers are `3 2 7`, the program should output `27 41 12` as the bets for each outcome. However, the program does not provide any output for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not attempt to solve the problem described.
