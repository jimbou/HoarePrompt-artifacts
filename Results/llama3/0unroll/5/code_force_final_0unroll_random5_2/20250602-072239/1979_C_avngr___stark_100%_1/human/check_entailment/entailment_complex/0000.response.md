Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for each outcome.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome. It then calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`, which applies `func_1` cumulatively to the list of multipliers.

The program then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for each outcome. If the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the LCM to calculate the amount of coins to bet on each outcome ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, as required by the problem.

Correctness: **True**
