Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to determine the bets. The idea is to find the LCM of all the multipliers and then use it to calculate the bets for each outcome.

The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor. `func_2` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the first two numbers, then the result and the next number, and so on.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`, and then uses it to calculate the bets for each outcome. The bets are calculated as the LCM divided by each multiplier.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program does not check if the calculated bets are valid, i.e., if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
2. The program does not handle the case where the input multipliers are not pairwise coprime (i.e., they have common factors). In such cases, the LCM calculated by `func_2` may not be the correct LCM.
3. The program does not handle the case where the input multipliers are not integers.

Due to these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
