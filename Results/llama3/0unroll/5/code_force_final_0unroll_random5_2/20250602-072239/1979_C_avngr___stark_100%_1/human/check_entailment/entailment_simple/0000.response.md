Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. `func_2` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the first number and each subsequent number in the list.

The main program reads the input, calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`, and then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The use of the LCM to calculate the bets ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
