Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, which is the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). `func_2` applies `func_1` cumulatively to a list of integers, starting with the first integer, and returns the final result.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome. It then calculates the LCM of all the multipliers using `func_2` and stores it in the variable `m`. It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing `m` by the multiplier for that outcome and stores these values in the list `c`.

If the sum of the amounts in `c` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the amounts in `c`.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and uses it to determine the amounts to bet on each outcome. The condition for printing -1 is also correct, as it checks if the sum of the amounts is greater than or equal to the LCM, which would mean that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is not strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
