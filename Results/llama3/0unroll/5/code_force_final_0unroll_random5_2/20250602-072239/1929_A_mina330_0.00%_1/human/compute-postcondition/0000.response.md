Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 2 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, `ntest` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 2 and 100. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of the other variables are not affected.
