Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This approach ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved by maximizing the differences between the elements.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When all elements are equal, the beauty is 0.
* When there are only two elements, the beauty is the difference between them.
* When there are more than two elements, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

The program also handles edge cases, such as when the input array is empty or contains only one element, by not attempting to calculate the beauty in these cases.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
