Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by first sorting the array in ascending order. Then, it calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

However, this approach is incorrect. The correct approach would be to calculate the beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This is because the beauty of the array is maximized when the largest element is paired with the smallest element, the second largest element is paired with the second smallest element, and so on.

The program's logic is flawed because it only considers the differences between the largest and smallest elements, and the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. It does not consider the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

For example, consider the input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The program would calculate the beauty of the array as (5 - 1) + (4 - 2) = 6. However, the correct beauty of the array is (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) + (5 - 4) = 4.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
