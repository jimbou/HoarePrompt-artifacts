Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements, sorts the array in ascending order, and then calculates the beauty of the array.

The key insight in the program is that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by placing the largest elements at the end of the array and the smallest elements at the beginning of the array. This is because the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and by placing the largest elements at the end, we maximize the differences.

The program calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between the largest half of the elements and the smallest half of the elements. This is done by iterating over the first half of the sorted array and adding the difference between the corresponding elements in the second half of the array.

The program then prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

Based on the provided execution states, the program has executed the loop `ntest` times, and for each test case, it has printed the correct beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
