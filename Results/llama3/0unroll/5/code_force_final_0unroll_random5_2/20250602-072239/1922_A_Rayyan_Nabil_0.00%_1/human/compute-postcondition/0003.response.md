Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether there exists at least one position in each test case where the characters in strings 'a' and 'c' are the same or the characters in strings 'b' and 'c' are the same. If such a position exists in all test cases, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function consumes all input from stdin and leaves it empty after execution.**
