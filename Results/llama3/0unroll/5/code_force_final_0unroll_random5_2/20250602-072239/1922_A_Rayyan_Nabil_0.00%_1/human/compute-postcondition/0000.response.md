Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000, l is 'YES', stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

Explanation: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `t`. Since `t` is between 1 and 1000, this line reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second line assigns the string 'YES' to `l`. No other variables are affected.
