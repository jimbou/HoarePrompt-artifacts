Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the strings a and b are identical, and the string c is different from a and b. In this case, the program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES' because we can create a template that matches a and b but not c.

For example, if the input is:

3
aa
aa
ab

The program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES' because we can create a template 'AA' that matches 'aa' but not 'ab'.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if there exists a position where a and b are different from c, but it does not consider the case where a and b are identical and c is different. To fix this, the program should also check if there exists a position where a and b are identical and c is different.
