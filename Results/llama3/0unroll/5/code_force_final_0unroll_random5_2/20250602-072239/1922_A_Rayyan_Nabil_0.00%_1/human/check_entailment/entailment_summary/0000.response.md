Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The logic of the program is flawed. It checks if there exists at least one position where the characters in strings 'a' and 'c' are different and the characters in strings 'b' and 'c' are different. However, the problem requires that there exists a template 't' such that the strings 'a' and 'b' match it, while the string 'c' does not. This means that the program should check if there exists at least one position where the characters in strings 'a' and 'b' are the same and the character in string 'c' is different from them.

Correctness: **False**
