Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c. If it finds a position where the characters in a and c are different and the characters in b and c are different, it sets the variable l to 'YES'. If it doesn't find such a position after checking all characters, it sets l to 'NO'. This is in line with the problem description, which requires that there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program prints 'YES' if such a template exists and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
