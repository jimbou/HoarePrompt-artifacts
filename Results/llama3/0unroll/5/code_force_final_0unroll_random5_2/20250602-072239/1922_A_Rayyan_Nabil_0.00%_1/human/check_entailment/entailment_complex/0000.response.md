Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and then reads the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program then checks for each position `i` in the strings whether `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is true for any position `i`, it sets the variable `l` to `'YES'`.
4. If the condition is not true for any position `i`, the `else` clause sets `l` to `'NO'`.
5. Finally, the program prints the value of `l` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. If such a template exists, it prints `'YES'`; otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

Correctness: **True**
