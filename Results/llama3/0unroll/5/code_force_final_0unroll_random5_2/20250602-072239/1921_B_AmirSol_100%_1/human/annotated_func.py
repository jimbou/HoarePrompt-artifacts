#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of n characters, each character is either '0' or '1'.
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the number of positions where s1 has '0' and s2 has '1', and the number of positions where s1 has '1' and s2 has '0'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two binary strings of equal length and returns the maximum number of positions where one string has '0' and the other has '1'. It takes two strings and their length as input, and returns an integer value representing the maximum difference in '0' and '1' positions between the two strings.
