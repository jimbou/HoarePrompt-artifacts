Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added and removed, and returns the maximum of these two values, which represents the minimum number of operations required.

The program's logic is sound because it takes into account the fact that a cat can be moved from one box to another in a single operation. Therefore, the number of cats that need to be added and removed is the maximum of the two, not the sum.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the example inputs and outputs demonstrate the program's correctness.

Correctness: **True**
