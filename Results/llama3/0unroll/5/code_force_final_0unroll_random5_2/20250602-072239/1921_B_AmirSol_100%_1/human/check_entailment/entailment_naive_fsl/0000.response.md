Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of days required to test the hypothesis. The function `func_1` takes the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s1`, and the desired state of the boxes `s2` as input. It then calculates the number of cats that need to be added and removed to achieve the desired state.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the number of cats to add is greater than the number of cats to remove, the program returns the number of cats to add.
* When the number of cats to remove is greater than the number of cats to add, the program returns the number of cats to remove.
* When the number of cats to add is equal to the number of cats to remove, the program returns the number of cats to add (or remove).

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* When the initial state and desired state are the same, the program returns 0.
* When the initial state and desired state are different, the program returns the minimum number of days required to achieve the desired state.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible cases.
