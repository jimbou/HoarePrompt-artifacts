Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations (adding, removing, or moving cats) to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats to add and remove, and returns the maximum of these two values.

This approach is correct because:

* Adding a cat to a box where it is not present in the initial state but is present in the desired state is a single operation.
* Removing a cat from a box where it is present in the initial state but is not present in the desired state is a single operation.
* Moving a cat from one box to another can be done in two operations: removing the cat from the initial box and adding it to the desired box. However, since the function returns the maximum of the number of cats to add and remove, it effectively counts each move as a single operation.

The function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.

Correctness: **True**
