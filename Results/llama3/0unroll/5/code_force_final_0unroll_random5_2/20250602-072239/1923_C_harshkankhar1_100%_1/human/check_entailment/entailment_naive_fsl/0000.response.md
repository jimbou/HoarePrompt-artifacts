Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The conditions are:

1. The sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to the sum of the elements in the corresponding subarray of array b.
2. No element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in array b.
3. All elements in array b are positive.

The program uses a prefix sum array `a` to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in any subarray, and another prefix sum array `b` to keep track of the minimum sum required for a subarray to be "good". The minimum sum is calculated by adding 1 to the sum of the subarray if the current element is greater than 1, and adding 2 otherwise.

The program then iterates over the queries, and for each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to the minimum sum required for the subarray to be "good". If it is, the program prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where the subarray has only one element, and the case where the subarray has multiple elements. The program also handles the case where the sum of the subarray is equal to the minimum sum required for the subarray to be "good", in which case it prints "YES".

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.
