Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array and a modified cumulative sum where each element is either 1 or 2 based on the corresponding element in the original array. This modified cumulative sum represents the minimum sum that the subarray would need to have in order to be "good", as each element in the subarray needs to be greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the original array.

The program then answers queries by comparing the cumulative sum of the subarray with the modified cumulative sum. If the cumulative sum of the subarray is less than the modified cumulative sum, it means that the subarray cannot be "good" because the sum of the subarray is not enough to make all elements greater than 0 and different from the corresponding elements in the original array. In this case, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program also correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element, in which case it is not possible for the subarray to be "good" because the element cannot be different from itself. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
