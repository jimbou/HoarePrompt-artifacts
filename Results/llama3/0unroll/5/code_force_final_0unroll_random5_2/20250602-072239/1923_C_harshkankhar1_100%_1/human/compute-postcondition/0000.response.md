Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of integers with length equal to n + 1, b is a list of zeros with length equal to n + 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

The code first reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `n` and `q`, respectively. The value of `n` is the number of test cases, and the value of `q` is the length of the array and the number of queries. The second line reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin, assigning them to `a` after adding a leading zero. The length of `a` is `n + 1`. The third line creates a list of zeros, `b`, with a length of `n + 1`. After executing the code, `n` and `q` have integer values, `a` is a list of integers with a length of `n + 1`, and `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
