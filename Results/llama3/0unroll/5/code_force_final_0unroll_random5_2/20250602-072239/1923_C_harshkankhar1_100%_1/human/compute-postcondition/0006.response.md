Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer array and a number of queries. It then calculates the cumulative sum of the array and a modified cumulative sum where each element is either 1 or 2 based on the corresponding element in the original array. The function then answers queries by comparing the cumulative sums of subarrays. If the cumulative sum of the original subarray is less than the modified cumulative sum, it prints 'NO', otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function repeats this process for all test cases.**
