Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year when the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by dividing `start_year` by the periodicity `nums[x]`, rounding up to the nearest integer using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1)`, and then multiplying by the periodicity `nums[x]`. This ensures that the next sign occurs after the previous sign has occurred.
5. The program prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when the `n`-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
