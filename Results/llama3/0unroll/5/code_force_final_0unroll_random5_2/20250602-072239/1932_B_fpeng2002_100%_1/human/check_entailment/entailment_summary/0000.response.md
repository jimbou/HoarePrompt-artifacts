Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the provided problem description. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

The program initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign occurs. It then iterates over the list of periodicities, updating `start_year` to be the least common multiple (LCM) of the current `start_year` and the current periodicity.

The LCM is calculated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which effectively rounds up the current `start_year` to the nearest multiple of the current periodicity.

After processing all periodicities, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly calculates and prints the LCM of the integers in each test case, which is the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
