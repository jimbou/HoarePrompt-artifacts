Output State: **num_tests is 0, and the standard output contains the least common multiple of the integers in each test case.**

In this output state, the variable `num_tests` has been decremented to 0 after all test cases have been processed. The standard output contains the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in each test case, which is calculated using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each integer `x` in the test case. The LCM is printed for each test case. The state of other variables, such as `n` and `nums`, remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
