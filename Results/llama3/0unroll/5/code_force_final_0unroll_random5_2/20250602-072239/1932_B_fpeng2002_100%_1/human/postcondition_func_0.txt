This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates and prints the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in each test case. The function continues to process test cases until it has read and processed all specified test cases, at which point it terminates, leaving the standard output containing the LCM of the integers in each test case.
