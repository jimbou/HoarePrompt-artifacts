Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The signs occur sequentially, and the tribe waits for each sign to occur before waiting for the next one.

The given program uses a simple iterative approach to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of signs and their periodicities. It then initializes a variable `start_year` to 0 and iterates over the signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur by dividing the current `start_year` by the sign's periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity. This effectively "waits" for the sign to occur before moving on to the next one.

The program then prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
