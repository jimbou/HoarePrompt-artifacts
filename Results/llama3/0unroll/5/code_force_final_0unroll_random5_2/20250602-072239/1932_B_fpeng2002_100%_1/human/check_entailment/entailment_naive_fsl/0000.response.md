Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, updating the start year for each sign to be the next multiple of its periodicity after the previous sign's start year. This ensures that each sign occurs sequentially, as required by the problem statement.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the periodicities are small or large, and cases where the periodicities are equal or unequal. The use of integer division and multiplication to update the start year ensures that the program produces the correct result even when the periodicities are large.

The program also handles the edge case where the input list is empty, in which case it simply prints 0. However, this is not a valid input according to the problem statement, which specifies that the input list must contain at least one element.

Overall, the program is correct and produces the expected output for all valid inputs.
