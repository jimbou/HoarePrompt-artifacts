Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of counts, each representing the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the sorted list, plus the number of integers in the list minus 2. The counts are printed for each test case. The initial state variables T, n, x, y, and the input lists remain unchanged.**
