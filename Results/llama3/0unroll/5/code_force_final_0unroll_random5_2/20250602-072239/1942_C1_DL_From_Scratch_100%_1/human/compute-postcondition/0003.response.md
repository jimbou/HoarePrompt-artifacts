Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of distinct integers. It calculates and prints the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the sorted list, plus the number of integers in the list minus 2, for each test case. The function does not modify the input variables and only produces output for each test case.**
