Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `T` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains t test cases, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y, where n is between 4 and 10^9, x is between 2 and the minimum of n and 2 * 10^5, and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
