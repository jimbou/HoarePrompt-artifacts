Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (`n_test`) and initializes an array (`answers`) to store the results of each test case.

2. For each test case, the program reads the number of integers (`n`) and the parameter (`m`) that determines when Sasha wins. It then reads the list of integers (`array`) and initializes variables to keep track of the total number of digits (`total_digits`) and the number of trailing zeros (`zeros`) in each integer.

3. The program defines a function (`func_1`) that takes an integer as a string and returns the number of trailing zeros in the integer.

4. The program iterates over the list of integers, calculates the total number of digits, and counts the number of trailing zeros in each integer using the `func_1` function. It stores the counts of trailing zeros in the `zeros` list.

5. The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order and then iterates over the list, subtracting the count of trailing zeros from the total number of digits for every other integer (starting from the first integer). This is done to simulate Anna's moves, where she reverses the integers with the most trailing zeros.

6. After simulating Anna's moves, the program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the subtracted zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, the program sets the result for the current test case to "Sasha" (indicating that Sasha wins); otherwise, it sets the result to "Anna".

7. Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
