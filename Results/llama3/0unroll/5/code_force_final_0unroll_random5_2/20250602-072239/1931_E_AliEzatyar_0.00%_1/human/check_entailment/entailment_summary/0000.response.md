Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The program first counts the total number of digits in the list and the number of trailing zeros in each number. It then subtracts the number of trailing zeros that Anna can remove by reversing the numbers from the total number of digits. If the result is greater than or equal to m + 1, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to count the number of trailing zeros in a given integer. This function iterates over the digits of the number from right to left and counts the number of zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

The program also correctly handles the case where Anna can remove trailing zeros by reversing the numbers. It subtracts the number of trailing zeros that Anna can remove from the total number of digits, which is the correct logic according to the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
