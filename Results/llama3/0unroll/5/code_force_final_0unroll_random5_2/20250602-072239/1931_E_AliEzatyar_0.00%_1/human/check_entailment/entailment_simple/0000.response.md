Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine who will win the game based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer.
3. The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the input array and stores the numbers with trailing zeros in the `zeros` list.
4. The program correctly sorts the `zeros` list in descending order and calculates the total number of zeros that will be removed by Anna's moves.
5. The program correctly checks if the total number of digits minus the removed zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
6. The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
