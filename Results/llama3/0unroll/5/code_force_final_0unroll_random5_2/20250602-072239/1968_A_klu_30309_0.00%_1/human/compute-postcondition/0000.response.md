Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, max_val is 1**

The code snippet provided does not modify the value of `x` and only assigns a new value to `max_val`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and `max_val` is set to 1. The code does not use the value of `x` in any calculations or operations, so its value remains the same as in the initial state.
