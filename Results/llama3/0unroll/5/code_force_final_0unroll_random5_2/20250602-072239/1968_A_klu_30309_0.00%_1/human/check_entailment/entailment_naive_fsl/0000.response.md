Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the integer y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y. The function func_1(x) iterates over all possible values of y from x-1 to 2 (since y must be less than x) and checks if x is divisible by y. If x is divisible by y, it checks if 2*y is greater than or equal to x. If this condition is true, it returns y as the optimal value. If not, it updates the max_val variable with the current value of y. If no such y is found, it returns the max_val.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where x is a prime number (in which case the optimal y is 1) and where x is an even number (in which case the optimal y is x/2). The program also correctly handles the case where x is a power of 2 (in which case the optimal y is x/2).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
