Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases: when the length of the input list `c` is 2, and when the length of the input list `c` is not 2. However, the problem statement requires the program to handle input lists of length up to 18.

In the case where the length of the input list `c` is 2, the program correctly prints "4 1" and "1 2". However, in the case where the length of the input list `c` is not 2, the program incorrectly prints "13 0", regardless of the actual values in the input list.

The program does not attempt to find the maximum sum of the elements of the array `a` or construct a sequence of operations to achieve this sum, as required by the problem statement. Instead, it simply prints a fixed output based on the length of the input list.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
