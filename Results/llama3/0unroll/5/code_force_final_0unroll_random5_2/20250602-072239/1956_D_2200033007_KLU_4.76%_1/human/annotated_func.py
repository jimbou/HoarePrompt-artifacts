#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of n non-negative integers where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18.
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: *`c` is a list of n non-negative integers where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18, `m` is 0. If `c` is a list of 2 non-negative integers, then "1 2" is printed. Otherwise, if `c` is a list of n non-negative integers where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18 and `c` is not equal to 2, then '13 0' is printed.
    return
    #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The program has printed either "1 2" if the list `c` has 2 non-negative integers, or "13 0" if the list `c` has n non-negative integers where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18 and not equal to 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and prints a specific message based on the length of the list. If the list has exactly 2 elements, it prints "1 2". If the list has any other length between 1 and 18 (inclusive), it prints "13 0". The function does not return any value.
