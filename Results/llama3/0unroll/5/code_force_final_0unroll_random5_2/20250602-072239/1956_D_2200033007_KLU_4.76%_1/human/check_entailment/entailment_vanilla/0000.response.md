Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the array is 2 or not 2 (in which case it prints a hardcoded answer for an array of length 3). It does not handle arrays of other lengths.

2. The function `func_1` does not use the array `a` at all. It only uses the length of the array, which is passed as an argument to the function.

3. The program does not attempt to solve the problem as described. It does not try to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing the given operation.

4. The program does not output the correct format. It is supposed to output the maximum sum of elements and the number of operations, followed by the parameters of each operation. However, the program only outputs two numbers, and they are not necessarily correct.

5. The program does not follow the problem's constraints. It is supposed to use no more than 5 * 10^5 operations, but the program does not even attempt to perform any operations.

Correctness: **False**
