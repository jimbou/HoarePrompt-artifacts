Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. It only handles two specific cases where the length of the array is 2 or 3, and prints hardcoded outputs for these cases. However, it does not provide a general solution for arrays of any length.

For example, if the input is an array of length 4, such as [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will not produce the correct output. It will only print "13 0", which is not the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing the given operation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm to find the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing the given operation. It should also generate the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

The program's current implementation is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, its correctness is **False**.
