Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The program only handles the cases when the length of the input list is 2 or not 2, and it prints a fixed message for each case. However, the problem requires the program to find the maximum sum of the elements of the array and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. The program does not perform any calculations or operations on the input list to find the maximum sum. It simply prints a fixed message based on the length of the list.

Correctness: **False**
