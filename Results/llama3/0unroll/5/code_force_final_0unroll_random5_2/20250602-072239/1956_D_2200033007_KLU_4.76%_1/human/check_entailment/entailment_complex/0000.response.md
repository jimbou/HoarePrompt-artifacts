Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases: when the length of the input list is 2, and when the length is not 2. However, the problem statement requires the program to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing a specific operation, and the program does not attempt to do this.

In fact, the program does not even use the input list `a` in any meaningful way. It simply checks the length of the list and prints a hardcoded message based on that length. This is not a correct solution to the problem.

Furthermore, the program does not follow the required output format, which is to print the maximum sum of elements and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The program only prints a single message, which does not provide the required information.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
