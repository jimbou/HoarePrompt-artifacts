Postcondition: ***`c` is a list of n non-negative integers where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18, `m` is 0. If `c` is a list of 2 non-negative integers, then "1 2" is printed. Otherwise, if `c` is a list of n non-negative integers where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 18 and `c` is not equal to 2, then '13 0' is printed.***
