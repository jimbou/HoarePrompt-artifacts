Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The given program uses a pre-computation approach to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in an array `values`.

2. The program first initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (2 * 10^5 + 1) with all elements as 0. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `inf` and calculates the sum of the digits for each number `i` by converting it to a string and summing up the integer values of its characters.

3. The program stores the cumulative sum of the digit sums in the `values` array. For each number `i`, it adds the sum of its digits to the cumulative sum of the previous number (`values[i - 1]`) and stores the result in `values[i]`.

4. After pre-computing the cumulative sums, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `value` and prints the corresponding cumulative sum from the `values` array.

5. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the maximum value (2 * 10^5), which is acceptable given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

6. The space complexity is also O(n), which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.

7. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input is 1, 2, or 3, and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
