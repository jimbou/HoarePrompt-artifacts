Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case (`n`).
2. It initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (which is set to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`) to store the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, for each `i` from 1 to `inf`.
3. The program then calculates the cumulative sum of the digits for each `i` from 1 to `inf` using a nested loop. The outer loop iterates over `i`, and the inner loop calculates the sum of the digits of `i` by converting `i` to a string, iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting it back to an integer, and adding it to the sum.
4. The program stores the cumulative sum of the digits for each `i` in the `values` array.
5. Finally, the program reads each test case value (`n`) and prints the corresponding cumulative sum of the digits from the `values` array.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading input values, calculating the sum of the digits, and printing the results without modifying any external state.

Correctness: **True**
