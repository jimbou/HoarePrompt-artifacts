Output State: **t is a positive integer, values is a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros, stdin contains a sequence of integers (the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case).**

Explanation: The first line assigns the value of 2 * 10^5 + 1 to inf. The second line assigns the integer value of the first input to t. Since the number of test cases is a positive integer, t becomes a positive integer. The third line creates a list of 2 * 10^5 + 1 zeros and assigns it to values. The stdin now contains a sequence of integers (the largest number Vladislav writes for each test case), as the first input (the number of test cases) has been consumed.
