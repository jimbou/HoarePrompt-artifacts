Output State: **stdin is empty, n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the standard input (stdin) is empty because two lines of input have been read. The variable `n` now holds an integer value between 1 and 100, which represents the number of test cases. The variable `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 100, which are the input values for the test cases. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` is an empty dictionary, which will likely be used to count occurrences of certain values in the input data.
