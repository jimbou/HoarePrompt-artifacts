Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a string of characters. It then processes each string, counting the number of '@' characters and ignoring the first character. If '*' characters appear after the first '@' character, it subtracts up to 2 of them from the count. The function prints the resulting count for each test case.**
