Output State: **The dictionary d contains the depth of each position in the string s, excluding the position n, where the depth is the number of open parentheses minus the number of close parentheses. The depth at each position is the same as the depth at the previous position plus one if the character at the current position is an open parenthesis, and minus one if the character at the current position is a close parenthesis. The depth at the first position is 0. The dictionary is sorted by depth in ascending order, and for positions with the same depth, they are sorted by their position in descending order.**
