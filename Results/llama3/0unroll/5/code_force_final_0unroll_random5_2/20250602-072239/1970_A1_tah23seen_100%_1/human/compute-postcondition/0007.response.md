Functionality: **This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input and returns a subset of the input string, where characters are ordered by their depth in ascending order and then by their position in descending order. The depth at each position is determined by the balance of open and close parentheses. The function effectively reorders the characters in the input string based on their nesting level and position, resulting in a new string that is a subset of the original input.**
