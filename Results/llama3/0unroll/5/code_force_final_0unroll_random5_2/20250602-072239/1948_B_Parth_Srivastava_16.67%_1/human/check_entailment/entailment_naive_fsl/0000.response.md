Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is [12, 3, 45, 67] and we apply the operation to the 3rd element, the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. However, the program does not correctly handle this case. It only checks if the digits of the number are in non-decreasing order, but it does not consider the case where the number is split into two digits and the resulting array is still not sorted.

For instance, in the given example, the program will split the 3rd element into 4 and 5, but it will not check if the resulting array [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] is sorted. It will only check if the digits 4 and 5 are in non-decreasing order, which they are, but the overall array is not sorted.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem description and is incorrect.
