Reasoning: 

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The program works by iterating through the input array, splitting numbers greater than 10 into separate tens and ones digits if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit, and checking if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the first element of the array is greater than 10 and where the array already contains numbers less than or equal to 10. It also correctly checks if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the line `if y >= c[n - 1]:`, the program checks if the tens digit of the current number is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c`. This condition is incorrect because it should check if the tens digit is less than or equal to the last element in the list `c`, not greater than or equal to. This is because the operation allows splitting a number into its tens and ones digits only if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
