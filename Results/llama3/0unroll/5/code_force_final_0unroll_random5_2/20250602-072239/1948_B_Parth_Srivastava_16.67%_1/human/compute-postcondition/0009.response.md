Functionality: **This function processes a list of integers, splitting numbers greater than 10 into separate tens and ones digits if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit, and checks if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order. It returns 1 if the list is sorted and 0 otherwise.**
