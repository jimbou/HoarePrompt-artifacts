Postcondition: ***The list d contains all elements from list c, sorted in ascending order. The list c contains all elements from list a, with elements greater than 10 split into two separate elements (tens and ones digits) if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit, otherwise the original number is appended. The variable n is equal to the length of list c. The values of k, x, and y are unchanged. The list c is not equal to the list d.***
