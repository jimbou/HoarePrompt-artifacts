Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains one integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned an integer value between 1 and 10^4, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The constraints on n and a_i remain the same, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
