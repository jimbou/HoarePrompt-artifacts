Output State: The output state is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of triplets that can be formed from the input list of integers, considering the constraints that at least two elements in the triplet must be equal. The list contains t-1 integers, each corresponding to a test case. The value of t remains unchanged, and the input list of integers is consumed by the loop, leaving the input stream empty.
