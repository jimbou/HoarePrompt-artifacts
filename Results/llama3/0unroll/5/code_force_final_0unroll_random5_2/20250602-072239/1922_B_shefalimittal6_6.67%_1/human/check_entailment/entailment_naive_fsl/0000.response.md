Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the number of combinations when there are at least two sticks of the same length. The current implementation adds the number of combinations of two sticks of the same length multiplied by the total number of other sticks, which is incorrect.

A correct approach would be to calculate the number of combinations of two sticks of the same length multiplied by the number of other sticks that are longer than the current stick. This is because a triangle can only be formed if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], the program will incorrectly count the combinations of two sticks of length 1 with the sticks of length 2 and 3, even though a triangle cannot be formed with sticks of length 1 and 2.

A correct implementation would require a more careful analysis of the possible combinations of sticks that can form a triangle.
