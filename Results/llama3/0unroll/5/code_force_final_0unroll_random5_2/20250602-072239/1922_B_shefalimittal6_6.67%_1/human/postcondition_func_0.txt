This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates and prints the number of triplets that can be formed from the given array of integers, considering both triplets with distinct elements and triplets with repeated elements. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case, leaving the standard input empty after execution.
