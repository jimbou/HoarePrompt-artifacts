Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the sum of the smallest numbers in each pair of input integers for each test case. It accepts a series of test cases, where each case contains an integer n followed by 2n integers. The function sorts these integers, pairs them up, and calculates the sum of the smallest number in each pair. The results are then printed out for each test case.**
