Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of integers (2n) and the 2n integers themselves. It sorts the integers in ascending order and then iterates over them in pairs, adding the smaller integer of each pair to the score. This is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score, as it ensures that the smallest integers are always paired together and added to the score.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n = 1 or where all integers are the same. It also handles the case where the input is not sorted, as it sorts the integers before processing them.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
