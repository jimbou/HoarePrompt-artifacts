The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the first line of stdin and assigns it to `t`. The value of `t` is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). The remaining lines of stdin contain `t` pairs of integers, each pair containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2). The values of `n` and `k` are not yet assigned to any variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each line containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2)**
