Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, expecting a specific format. It first reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k. Based on the value of k, it prints either 1 or n. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints n. The function outputs a list of t integers, where each integer corresponds to the result of each test case.**
