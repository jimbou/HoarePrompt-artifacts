Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `low` is the largest index `i` such that `arr[i] <= k`. This means that `low` is the index of the last element in the array that is less than or equal to `k`.
* `high` is `low + 1`. This means that `high` is the index of the first element in the array that is greater than `k`.
* `st` is a set of indices `i` such that `low <= i <= high` and `arr[i] > k`. This means that `st` contains the indices of all elements in the array that are greater than `k` and are located between `low` and `high` (inclusive).
* `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`. This means that the element at index `low` is not equal to `k`.
* `1` is printed. This is a separate statement that prints the number `1`.

Now, let's analyze the `print` statement:

* `low + 1`: This will print the value of `low` plus one. Since `low` is the largest index `i` such that `arr[i] <= k`, `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in the array that is greater than `k`.
* `pos + 1`: There is no variable `pos` defined in the precondition, so we cannot determine the value of `pos + 1`. However, based on the context, it is likely that `pos` is intended to be the position of the first element in the array that is greater than `k`, which would be `high`. If that's the case, then `pos + 1` would be equivalent to `high + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **low + 1 (which is the index of the first element in the array that is greater than k), high + 1 (which is the index of the second element in the array that is greater than k)**

Note that the exact values of `low` and `high` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `arr` and `k`.
