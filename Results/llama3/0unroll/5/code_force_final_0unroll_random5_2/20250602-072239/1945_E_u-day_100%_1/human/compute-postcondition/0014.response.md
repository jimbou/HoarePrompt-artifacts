Functionality: **This function determines the position of a target value k in a sorted list of distinct integers from 1 to n. It first finds the index of k in the list, then performs a binary search to find the largest index i such that the value at index i is less than or equal to k. If the value at this index is equal to k, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 and the indices of the first and second elements in the list that are greater than k. The function does not modify the input list or the values of n and k.**
