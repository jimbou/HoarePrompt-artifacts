Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a target value `k` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a modified binary search algorithm. The program consists of multiple functions, but the main logic is implemented in `func_3`.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly using `func_1` and `func_2`, which handle the task of reading a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returning a list of integers, respectively.
2.  In `func_3`, the program finds the position of the target value `k` in the permutation `p` and stores it in the variable `pos`.
3.  The program then performs a binary search to find the largest index `i` such that the value at index `i` is less than or equal to `k`. This is done using the `while` loop, which iteratively updates the `low` and `high` variables until `low + 1 >= high`.
4.  After the binary search, the program checks if the value at the `low` index is equal to `k`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed.
5.  If the value at the `low` index is not equal to `k`, the program prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed, and then prints the indices of the first and second elements in the list that are greater than `k`. This is done to swap the elements at these indices, which will result in the target value `k` being at the correct position.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the modified binary search algorithm and handles the swapping of elements to find the target value `k` in the permutation `p`.

Correctness: **True**
