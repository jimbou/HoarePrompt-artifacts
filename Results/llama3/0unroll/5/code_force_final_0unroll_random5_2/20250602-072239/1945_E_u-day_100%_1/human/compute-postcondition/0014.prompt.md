You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and the function func_1() returns a tuple of two integers (n, k), and the function func_2() returns a list of integers arr.
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: The value of pos is the index of k in arr, and the values of n, k, and arr remain unchanged.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low is the largest index i such that arr[i] <= k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices i such that low <= i <= high and arr[i] > k.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1 (which is the index of the first element in the array that is greater than k), high + 1 (which is the index of the second element in the array that is greater than k)
    #State: low is the largest index i such that arr[i] <= k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices i such that low <= i <= high and arr[i] > k. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed, and the value of low + 1 and pos + 1 is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: low is the largest index i such that arr[i] <= k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices i such that low <= i <= high and arr[i] > k. The current value of arr[low] is equal to k, and 0 is being printed

Case_2: low is the largest index i such that arr[i] <= k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices i such that low <= i <= high and arr[i] > k, and arr[low] is not equal to k, and 1 is printed, and the value of low + 1 and pos + 1 is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
