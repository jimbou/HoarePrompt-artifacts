Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6

The program will output:

1
2 4

However, this is not the correct solution. The correct solution would be to swap the elements at positions 2 and 4, and then swap the elements at positions 1 and 3. This is because the binary search algorithm requires the array to be sorted, and the given array is not sorted.

The program does not correctly handle cases where the target element is not in the correct position after the first swap. It only checks if the element at the low index is equal to the target element, but it does not check if the element at the high index is equal to the target element. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the target element is not in the correct position after the first swap.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
