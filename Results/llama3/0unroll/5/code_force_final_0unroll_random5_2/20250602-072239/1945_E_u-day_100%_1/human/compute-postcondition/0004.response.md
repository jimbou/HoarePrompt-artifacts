Output State: **low is the largest index i such that arr[i] <= k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices i such that low <= i <= high and arr[i] > k.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

*   The variable "low" will be the largest index in the array "arr" such that the value at that index is less than or equal to "k".
*   The variable "high" will be one more than "low".
*   The set "st" will contain all indices "i" such that "low" is less than or equal to "i" and "i" is less than or equal to "high", and the value at index "i" in the array "arr" is greater than "k".
