Output State: **low is 0, high is n, st is an empty set, the values of n, k, arr, and pos remain unchanged.**

In this code snippet, the first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `low` and the value of `n` to the variable `high`. The second line creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `st`. Since `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` are not modified by the code, their values remain unchanged.
