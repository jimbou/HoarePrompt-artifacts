Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, pos is -1**

The code executes the functions func_1() and func_2(), which return the values of n, k, and arr, respectively. The values of n and k are assigned to the variables n and k, and the value of arr is assigned to the variable arr. The variable pos is initialized to -1. The final state includes the values of n, k, arr, and pos, as well as the fact that n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order.
