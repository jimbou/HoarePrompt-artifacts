Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1(s)` iterates through the binary string `s` and increments the cost by the count of consecutive '1's plus one whenever a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's. This approach correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

Correctness: **True**
