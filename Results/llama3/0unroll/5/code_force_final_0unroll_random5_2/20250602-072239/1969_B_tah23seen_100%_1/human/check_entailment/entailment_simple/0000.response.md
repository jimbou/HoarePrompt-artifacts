Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program uses a function `func_1` that iterates through the input string `s` and calculates the cost based on the occurrences of '0' and '1'.

The program's logic is as follows:

- It initializes a variable `cost` to 0, which will store the total cost.
- It initializes a variable `one` to 0, which will store the count of consecutive '1's encountered so far.
- It iterates through the string `s`. If it encounters a '1', it increments the `one` count. If it encounters a '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it increments the `cost` by `one + 1`. This is because a '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's requires a cyclic shift of the entire sequence to maintain non-descending order.
- After iterating through the entire string, the `cost` variable holds the total cost, and the `one` variable holds the total count of '1's in the string.
- The program returns the `cost` as the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by iterating through the string only once. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, and the space complexity is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of space to store the `cost` and `one` variables.

Correctness: **True**
