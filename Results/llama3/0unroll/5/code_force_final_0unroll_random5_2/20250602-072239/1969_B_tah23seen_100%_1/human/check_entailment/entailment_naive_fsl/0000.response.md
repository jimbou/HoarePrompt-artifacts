Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input string is "101", the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. This is because the program is counting the number of '1's before each '0', but it's not considering the case where a '1' can be moved to the end of the string to make it sorted.

In the given example, the string "101" can be sorted by moving the '1' to the end, resulting in the string "011", which has a cost of 1. However, the program is counting the '1' before the '0' and adding 2 to the cost, resulting in an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
