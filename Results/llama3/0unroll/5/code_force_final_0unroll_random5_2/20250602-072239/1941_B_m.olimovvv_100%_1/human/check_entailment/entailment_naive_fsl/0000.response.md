Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but the correct output should be "NO". The reason is that the program does not check if the elements of the array can be made equal to zero using the described operations. It only checks if the elements are non-negative and if the last two elements are zero.

A correct solution would need to check if the elements of the array can be made equal to zero using the described operations, which involves checking if the sum of the elements is a multiple of 3 and if the elements can be reduced to zero using the operations.

Here is a correct solution:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total = sum(b)
        if total % 3 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        target = total // 3
        for i in range(a - 1):
            if b[i] > target:
                b[i + 1] -= (b[i] - target) * 2
                b[i + 2] -= (b[i] - target)
                b[i] = target
        if b[-1] == 0 and b[-2] == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

This solution first checks if the sum of the elements is a multiple of 3. If it is not, it prints "NO". Then it calculates the target value for each element, which is the sum of the elements divided by 3. It then iterates over the elements, reducing each element to the target value using the operations. Finally, it checks if the last two elements are zero, and if they are, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
