Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, depending on whether the list of integers can be reduced to zero by the given operations. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' will be equal to the number of test cases (t). The stdin will be empty after all inputs have been read.**
