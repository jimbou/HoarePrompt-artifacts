Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the described operations.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It iterates over each test case, reading the number of elements `a` and the list of integers `b`.
2. It then iterates over the list of integers, applying the operations to each element. For each element `b[i]`, it subtracts twice its value from the next element `b[i+1]`, subtracts its value from the element after next `b[i+2]`, and sets the current element `b[i]` to zero.
3. If at any point the current element `b[i]` becomes negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, as it's not possible to make all elements zero.
4. After applying the operations to all elements, it checks if the last two elements `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to make all elements zero. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the operations described in the problem statement and checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero.

Correctness: **True**
