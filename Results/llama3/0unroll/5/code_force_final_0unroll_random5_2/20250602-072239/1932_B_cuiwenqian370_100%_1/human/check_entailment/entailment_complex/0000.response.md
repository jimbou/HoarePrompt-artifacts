Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The program reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the results to standard output.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the last year value for each test case. It initializes the last year to the first sign's periodicity and then iterates through the remaining signs, updating the last year to the next occurrence of each sign after the previous sign has occurred. This is done using the formula `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which calculates the next occurrence of the current sign after the previous sign has occurred.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases, the number of signs in each test case, and the periodicities of the signs. It then calculates the last year value for each test case and appends the result as a string to a list. Finally, it writes the list of results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
