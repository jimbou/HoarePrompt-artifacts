Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains T test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

Explanation:

*   The first line assigns the entire input from stdin to the variable `input`.
*   The second line splits the input into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter and assigns it to the variable `data`.
*   The third line initializes the variable `index` to 0.
*   The fourth line converts the first element of the `data` list (at index 0) to an integer and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the input is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `T` will be an integer within this range.
*   The fifth line increments the `index` variable by 1, making it 1.
*   The sixth line initializes an empty list `results`.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

*   `T` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, representing the number of test cases.
*   `index` is 1, indicating that the first element of the `data` list has been processed.
*   `results` is an empty list, which will likely be used to store the results of each test case.
*   `stdin` still contains the remaining input, which consists of `T` test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
