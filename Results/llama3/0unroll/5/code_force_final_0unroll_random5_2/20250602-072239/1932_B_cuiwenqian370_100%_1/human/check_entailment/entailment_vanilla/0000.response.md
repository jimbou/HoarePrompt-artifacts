Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the input data from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read()`. It then splits the input data into a list of strings using the `split()` method.

2. The program then reads the number of test cases `T` from the input data and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results of each test case.

3. For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` from the input data.

4. The program initializes the `last_year` variable to the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.

5. The program then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second sign to the n-th sign). For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

6. The program updates the `last_year` variable to the calculated `next_year` for each sign.

7. After iterating over all signs, the program appends the final `last_year` (which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen) to the `results` list as a string.

8. Finally, the program writes the results of all test cases to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
