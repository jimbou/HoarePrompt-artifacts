Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, index is T + 1 + sum of all n values in the test cases, results is a list of T strings, each representing the last year value for the corresponding test case, stdin is empty, and the output is printed to the console with each string from the results list on a new line, followed by an extra newline character.**

In natural language, the output state is that the values of T, index, and results remain the same as in the initial state. However, the contents of the results list are now printed to the console, with each string on a new line, and an extra newline character at the end. The stdin is now empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
