Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the results to standard output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer T, representing the number of test cases, followed by T test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The function calculates the last year value for each test case based on the given integers and appends the result as a string to a list. Finally, it writes the list of results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character.**
