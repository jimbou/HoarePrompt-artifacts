Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases `T`, the number of signs `n` for each test case, and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2.  It initializes the `last_year` variable with the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.
3.  The program then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second sign to the `n`-th sign). For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur after the previous sign has occurred. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which effectively rounds up the `last_year + 1` to the nearest multiple of `a[i]`.
4.  The program updates the `last_year` variable with the calculated `next_year` for each sign.
5.  After processing all signs for a test case, the program appends the final `last_year` value as a string to the `results` list.
6.  Finally, the program writes the list of results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
