Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of sign periodicities, calculating the year when each sign will occur based on the previous sign's year and the current sign's periodicity. The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` correctly determines the next year when the current sign will occur, taking into account the fact that the tribe starts waiting for the next sign from the year after the previous sign occurred.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When the periodicities are in increasing order (e.g., 3, 4, 5, ...).
* When the periodicities are in decreasing order (e.g., 5, 4, 3, ...).
* When the periodicities are the same (e.g., 1, 1, 1, ...).
* When the periodicities are large numbers (e.g., 50, 30, 711, ...).

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the number of signs is 1, in which case the year of the apocalypse is simply the periodicity of the single sign.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
