Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (T), the number of signs (n) for each test case, and the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program then iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur. This is done by iterating over the periodicities of the signs, starting from the second sign (since the first sign occurs in the year a_1). For each sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, which is the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the previous year.

The program stores the calculated year for each test case in a list called "results". Finally, the program writes the results to the standard output, one result per line.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program is correct. The program correctly reads the input data, calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case, and writes the results to the standard output.

Correctness: **True**
