The function generates a string of n characters based on the input list a, where each character in the string corresponds to the jth letter of the alphabet, and j is the smallest index such that char_count[j] equals a[i] before the execution of the inner loop body. The string has a specific distribution of letters, where the jth letter of the alphabet appears char_count[j] times. The function takes a list of n non-negative integers as input and returns a string of n characters.
