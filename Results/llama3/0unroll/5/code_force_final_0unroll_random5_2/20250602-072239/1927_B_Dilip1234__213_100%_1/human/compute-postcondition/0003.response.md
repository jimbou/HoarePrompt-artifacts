Output State: **The program returns a string s of n characters, where each character c in s is the jth letter of the alphabet, and j is the smallest index such that char_count[j] equals a[i] before the execution of the inner loop body. The string s has a specific distribution of letters, where the jth letter of the alphabet appears char_count[j] times, and char_count is a list of 26 non-negative integers.**
