Output State: s is a string of n characters such that for each character c in s, c is the jth letter of the alphabet where j is the smallest index such that char_count[j] equals a[i] before the execution of the inner loop body, and char_count is a list of 26 non-negative integers such that for each j (0 <= j < 26), char_count[j] is the number of times the jth letter of the alphabet appears in s.
