You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i (0 <= i < n), a[i] <= i.
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: Output State: s is a string of n characters such that for each character c in s, c is the jth letter of the alphabet where j is the smallest index such that char_count[j] equals a[i] before the execution of the inner loop body, and char_count is a list of 26 non-negative integers such that for each j (0 <= j < 26), char_count[j] is the number of times the jth letter of the alphabet appears in s.
    return s
    #The program returns a string s of n characters, where each character c in s is the jth letter of the alphabet, and j is the smallest index such that char_count[j] equals a[i] before the execution of the inner loop body. The string s has a specific distribution of letters, where the jth letter of the alphabet appears char_count[j] times, and char_count is a list of 26 non-negative integers.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string s of n characters, where each character c in s is the jth letter of the alphabet, and j is the smallest index such that char_count[j] equals a[i] before the execution of the inner loop body. The string s has a specific distribution of letters, where the jth letter of the alphabet appears char_count[j] times, and char_count is a list of 26 non-negative integers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
