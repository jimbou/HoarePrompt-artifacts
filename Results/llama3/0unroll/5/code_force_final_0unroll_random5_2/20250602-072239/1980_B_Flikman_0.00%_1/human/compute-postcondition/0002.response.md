Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers (t, f, k), and the second line contains t integers. For each test case, it identifies the favorite value (the integer at index f-1), counts the occurrences of this value, and counts the number of integers greater than the favorite value. Based on these counts, it prints 'YES' if the number of greater values is at least k, 'NO' if the sum of the same and greater values is less than or equal to k, and 'MAYBE' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results to the console.**
