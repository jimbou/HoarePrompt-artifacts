Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. It first finds the value of the favorite cube, then counts the number of cubes with the same value and the number of cubes with greater values. Based on these counts, it determines whether the favorite cube will be removed or not.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- If the number of cubes with greater values is greater than or equal to k, the favorite cube will be removed, so the program prints 'YES'.
- If the number of cubes with greater values plus the number of cubes with the same value is less than or equal to k, the favorite cube will not be removed, so the program prints 'NO'.
- In all other cases, the favorite cube may be removed or not, so the program prints 'MAYBE'.

The program does not have any logical errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
