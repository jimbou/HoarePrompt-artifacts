Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of cubes (n), the index of the favorite cube (f), and the number of removed cubes (k).
2. It identifies the favorite value by accessing the element at index f-1 in the list of cube values (a).
3. The program correctly counts the occurrences of the favorite value (same_value_count) and the number of values greater than the favorite value (greater_count).
4. The conditional statements are correct:
   - If the number of greater values is at least k, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed in all cases.
   - If the sum of the same and greater values is less than or equal to k, it prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite cube will not be removed in any case.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE', indicating that the favorite cube may be either removed or left.

Correctness: **True**
