The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, and the first line contains three integers `t`, `f`, and `k`, the value of `t` is the first integer of the first line of a test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `f` and `k`, and the second line contains `t` integers `a_i`**
