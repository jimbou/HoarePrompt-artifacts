Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 calculates the sum of the lengths of all substrings that end with '0' and are preceded by one or more '1's. This is not directly related to the minimum total cost required to sort the string.

However, upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the calculated sum is actually the minimum total cost required to sort the string. This is because the substrings that end with '0' and are preceded by one or more '1's are the ones that need to be cyclically shifted to sort the string. The cost of each such shift is equal to the length of the substring, which is added to the total cost.

Function 2 reads the input correctly and calls Function 1 for each test case. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
