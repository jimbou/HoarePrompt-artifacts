Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input string is "000111". The program will output 6, but the correct answer is 0 because the string is already sorted.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the number of '1's before each '0' and adds the count to the answer. However, this approach does not consider the case where the string is already sorted or where a cyclic shift can be applied to sort the string.

A correct approach would be to count the number of '1's and '0's in the string and then calculate the minimum number of operations required to sort the string. This can be done by finding the longest contiguous substring of '1's and '0's and then calculating the minimum number of operations required to move the '1's to the right of the '0's.

For example, in the case of the input string "000111", the longest contiguous substring of '1's is "111" and the longest contiguous substring of '0's is "000". Since the string is already sorted, the minimum number of operations required is 0.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
