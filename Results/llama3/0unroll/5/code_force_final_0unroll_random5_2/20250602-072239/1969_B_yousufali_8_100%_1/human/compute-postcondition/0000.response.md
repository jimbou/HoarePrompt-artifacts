Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t lines, each containing a binary string s, where the length of each string is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
