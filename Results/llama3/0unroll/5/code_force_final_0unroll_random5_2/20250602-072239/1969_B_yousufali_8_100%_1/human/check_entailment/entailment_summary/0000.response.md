Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1()` takes a binary string as input and calculates the sum of the lengths of all substrings that end with '0' and are preceded by one or more '1's. This is equivalent to finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted, as each such substring needs to be shifted to the right to maintain the non-descending order.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer `t` from standard input, then reads `t` binary strings from standard input and processes each string by calling `func_1()` `t` times. This is equivalent to solving the problem for multiple test cases.

Since `func_1()` correctly calculates the minimum total cost for a single binary string, and `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one, the program as a whole meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
