Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string `s` as input and initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of consecutive '1's and `ans` to store the total cost. It then iterates through the string, incrementing `n` whenever it encounters a '1'. When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because a cyclic shift of a substring ending with a '1' and followed by a '0' would require a cost of `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of consecutive '1's before the '0'. Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

Function 2 (`func_2`) takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases. It then calls `func_1` for each test case.

The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the required logic to solve the problem. The key insight is that the cost of a cyclic shift is equal to the length of the chosen substring, and the program correctly calculates this cost by incrementing `n` for each consecutive '1' and adding `n + 1` to `ans` when a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's.

Correctness: **True**
