Output State: **The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the string c can be formed by taking characters from strings a and b, with the constraint that each character in c must be taken from the same position in either a or b. The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' statements, one for each test case. The value of the variable 'tests' will remain unchanged, and the contents of stdin will be consumed.**
