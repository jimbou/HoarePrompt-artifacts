Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. It then checks whether the string c can be formed by taking characters from strings a and b, with the constraint that each character in c must be taken from the same position in either a or b. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if c can be formed and 'NO' otherwise. The function consumes the contents of standard input and does not modify any external state.**
