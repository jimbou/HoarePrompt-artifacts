Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, where each integer is the value of `cur` after the loop executes for each test case. The value of `cur` is determined by the maximum value in the sorted list `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, or the second smallest value in `N` if there are at least two values with a count of 1 in the dictionary `M`. The output state will contain `T` integers, where `T` is the number of test cases.**
