Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array `a` of size `n`. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T` and then iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
4. It initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will be used to keep track of the current MEX value.
5. It creates a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each number in the array.
6. It iterates over the sorted array `a`. For each number `num`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop. If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
7. After the loop, it checks if the sum of the frequencies in the dictionary `M` is equal to the size of the array `n`. If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
8. It creates a list `cnt` to store the numbers in the dictionary `M` that have a frequency of 1.
9. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to the second element of `cnt`.
10. Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which represents the final score of the game.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the code:

* The variable names are not very descriptive, making it difficult to understand the code at first glance.
* The code uses a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each number, but it only uses the keys of the dictionary. It would be more efficient to use a list or a set to store the unique numbers.
* The code uses a list `cnt` to store the numbers with a frequency of 1, but it only uses the first two elements of the list. It would be more efficient to use a variable to store the second element directly.

Despite these minor issues, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
