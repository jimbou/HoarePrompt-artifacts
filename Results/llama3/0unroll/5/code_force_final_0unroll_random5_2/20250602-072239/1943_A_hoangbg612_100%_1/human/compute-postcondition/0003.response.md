Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers. It sorts the list, identifies the maximum value that is not greater than the current value plus one, and updates the current value accordingly. If there are at least two values with a count of 1 in the list, it updates the current value to the second smallest value. The function then prints the final current value for each test case.**
