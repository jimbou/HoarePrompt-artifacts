Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description states that when a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing. However, the program does not correctly implement this step.

In the program, when a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, it is inserted into the array a at the correct position, but the most difficult problem is not deleted from the contest. Instead, the program simply removes the last element from the array a, which is not necessarily the most difficult problem.

For example, consider the input:

2
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000

The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 3. The correct steps to solve this problem are:

1. Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200].
2. Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000].
3. Propose a problem with difficulty w=3000 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,3000].

The program does not correctly implement these steps, and therefore it is incorrect.
