#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of three elements. The first element is a positive integer. The second and third elements are lists of integers of the same length as the first element, sorted in non-decreasing order.
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of three elements in descending order. The first element is a positive integer. The second and third elements are lists of integers of the same length as the first element, sorted in non-decreasing order.

#Overall this is what the function does:Sorts a list of three elements in descending order, where the first element is a positive integer and the second and third elements are lists of integers of the same length as the first element, maintaining their non-decreasing order.
