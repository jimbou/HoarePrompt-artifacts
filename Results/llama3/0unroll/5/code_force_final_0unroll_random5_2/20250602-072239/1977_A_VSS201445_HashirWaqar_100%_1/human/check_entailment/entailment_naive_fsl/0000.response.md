Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the number of moves is sufficient to add m cubes and if the remaining moves (n - m) are even, which is necessary to remove the excess cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If n is less than m, it's impossible to have a tower with m cubes, so it prints "NO".
* If n is greater than or equal to m, but (n - m) is odd, it's impossible to remove the excess cubes, so it prints "NO".
* If n is greater than or equal to m and (n - m) is even, it's possible to have a tower with m cubes, so it prints "YES".

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n and m are both 1, or when n is much larger than m.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
