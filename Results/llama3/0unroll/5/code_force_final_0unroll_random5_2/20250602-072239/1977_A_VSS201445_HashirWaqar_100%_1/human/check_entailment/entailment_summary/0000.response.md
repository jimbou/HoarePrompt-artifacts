Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The given program checks if the difference between n and m is even, which is a necessary condition for it to be possible to end up with m cubes after n moves.

The reasoning behind this is that if the difference between n and m is even, it means that the number of moves required to add or remove cubes to reach m is even. Since each move involves adding or removing 1 cube, an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes being added or removed, which can lead to a total of m cubes.

However, the program does not check if n is greater than or equal to m, which is also a necessary condition. If n is less than m, it's impossible to end up with m cubes after n moves, regardless of the parity of the difference between n and m.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not check for this additional necessary condition.

Correctness: **False**
