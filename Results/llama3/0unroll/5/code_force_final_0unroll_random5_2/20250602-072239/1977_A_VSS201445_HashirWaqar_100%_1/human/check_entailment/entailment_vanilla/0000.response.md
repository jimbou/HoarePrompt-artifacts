Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

2. The given program uses a simple condition to check if it's possible to achieve m cubes after n moves. The condition checks if n is greater than or equal to m and if the difference between n and m is even.

3. The condition n >= m ensures that there are enough moves to add at least m cubes to the tower.

4. The condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 checks if the remaining moves (after adding m cubes) are even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove a cube, so an even number of moves is required to end up with the same number of cubes.

5. If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to achieve m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

6. The program correctly handles the problem constraints, which state that 1 <= n, m <= 100.

7. The example test cases provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.

8. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
