Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower. The given program checks if the difference between n and m is even, which is a necessary condition for it to be possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves.

However, the program also checks if n is greater than or equal to m, which is not a necessary condition. The correct condition should be that the absolute difference between n and m is even, regardless of whether n is greater than or equal to m.

Therefore, the correct program should be:

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

Correctness: **False**
