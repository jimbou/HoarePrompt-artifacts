Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program uses a simple and correct approach to solve this problem. It iterates over each test case, reads the values of n and m, and checks two conditions:

1.  If n is greater than or equal to m, it means that Nikita has enough moves to build a tower with m cubes.
2.  If the difference between n and m is even, it means that Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs, resulting in a tower with m cubes.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the range of values for n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). The use of the modulo operator (%) to check if the difference between n and m is even is also correct.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
