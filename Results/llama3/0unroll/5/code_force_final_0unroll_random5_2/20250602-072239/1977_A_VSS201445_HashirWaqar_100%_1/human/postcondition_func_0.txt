This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m. It then determines whether the difference between n and m is even for each test case and prints 'YES' if it is, or 'NO' if it is not. The function processes multiple test cases and prints a corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' for each case.
