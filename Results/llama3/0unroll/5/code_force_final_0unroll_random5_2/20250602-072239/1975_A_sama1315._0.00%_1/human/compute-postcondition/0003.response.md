Based on the precondition, the `results` list contains `t` results, which are the outcomes of `t` iterations of the loop. Each result is the output of the `func_1(arr)` function, where `arr` is a slice of the `data` list.

Since the `print` statement uses the `join` method with a newline character (`'\n'`) as the separator, the output will be a string containing all the results from the `results` list, separated by newline characters.

Therefore, the output will be a multi-line string, where each line represents the result of one iteration of the loop.

Output: **a multi-line string containing t results, each result being the output of func_1(arr) for a different slice of the data list, separated by newline characters**
