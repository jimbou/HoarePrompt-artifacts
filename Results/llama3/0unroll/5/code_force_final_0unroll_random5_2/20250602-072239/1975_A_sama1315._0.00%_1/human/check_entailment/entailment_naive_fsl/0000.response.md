Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires checking if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after splitting it into two parts and swapping them. However, the program only checks if the array is already sorted or not.

For example, if the input array is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], the program will return 'No' because the array is not sorted. However, it is possible to split the array into two parts [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5], swap them, and get the sorted array [1, 4, 1, 5, 3].

The program does not consider this possibility and only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not the correct solution to the problem.
