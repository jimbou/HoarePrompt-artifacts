Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation some number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping these two parts.

Function 1, `func_1(arr)`, checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns 'Yes'. If the array is not sorted, the function checks if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are in the correct order (i.e., the first element is less than or equal to the second element). If such a pair exists, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted after performing the operation. If no such pair exists, the function returns 'No'.

Function 2, `func_2()`, reads input from the standard input, processes the input data, and calls Function 1 for each test case. It then prints the results.

However, there is a logical flaw in Function 1. The function checks if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements that are in the correct order, but this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted after performing the operation. The function should check if there is a prefix of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and if the rest of the array is also sorted in non-decreasing order. If such a prefix exists, the array can be sorted after performing the operation.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
