Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is 1, t is a non-negative integer, n is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, results is an empty list.**

The code snippet reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the variable `data`. The `index` variable is initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1. The value of the first element in the `data` list is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`. An empty list called `results` is also created. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged.
