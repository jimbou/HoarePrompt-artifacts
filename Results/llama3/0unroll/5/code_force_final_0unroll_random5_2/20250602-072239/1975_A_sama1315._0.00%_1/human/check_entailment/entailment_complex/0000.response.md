Reasoning: 

The problem statement requires checking if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times. The operation is equivalent to finding a rotation of the array that results in a sorted array.

Function 1 checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted and 'No' otherwise. However, this function does not consider the possibility of rotating the array to make it sorted.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results. It calls Function 1 with each batch of integers as an argument and appends the result to a list of results.

However, the problem statement requires checking if the array can become sorted after performing the operation any number of times, not just checking if the array is already sorted. Function 1 does not meet this requirement.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
