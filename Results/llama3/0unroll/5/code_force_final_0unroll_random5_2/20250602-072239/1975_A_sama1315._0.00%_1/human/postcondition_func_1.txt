This function reads input from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results. It takes no arguments and returns no value. The input is expected to be a list of strings where each string represents an integer, followed by a series of batches, each batch consisting of a non-negative integer (n) and a list of n integers. The function processes each batch by calling another function (func_1) with the list of integers as an argument, and appends the result to a list of results. After processing all batches, the function prints the list of results, one result per line.
