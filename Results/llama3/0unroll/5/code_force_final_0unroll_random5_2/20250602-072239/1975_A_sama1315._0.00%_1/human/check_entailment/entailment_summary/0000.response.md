Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted and 'No' otherwise.

func_2 reads input from standard input, processes it in batches, and prints the results. It takes no arguments and returns no value. The input is expected to be a list of strings where each string represents an integer, followed by a series of batches, each batch consisting of a non-negative integer (n) and a list of n integers. The function processes each batch by calling func_1 with the list of integers as an argument, and appends the result to a list of results. After processing all batches, the function prints the list of results, one result per line.

However, the problem statement requires the program to determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation any number of times. The program only checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order, but it does not consider the possibility of swapping the two parts of the array to achieve a non-decreasing order.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not fully address the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
