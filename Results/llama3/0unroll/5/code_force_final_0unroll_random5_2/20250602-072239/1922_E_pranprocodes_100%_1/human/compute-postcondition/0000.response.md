Output State: The output state will contain the number of test cases (an integer) followed by the results of each test case. Each test case result will consist of two lines: the first line will contain the number of operations (t) required to reduce the input number (X) to 1, and the second line will contain the sequence of numbers (ans) generated during the process. The sequence will be in reverse order, starting from the last number generated (which will be either max or min) and ending at the first number generated (which will be either max or min). The values of max and min will be updated accordingly based on the operations performed. The input number (X) will be reduced to 1 after the loop finishes executing.
