Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a sequence of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations (t) required to reduce the corresponding input integer (X) to 1, followed by the sequence of integers (ans) that represent the operations performed to reduce X to 1. The sequence of integers is in reverse order, with the last operation performed first. The output state is printed to the console, with each test case's output on a new line.
