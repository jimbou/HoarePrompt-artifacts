Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of positive integers from standard input, where each integer represents a test case. For each test case, it performs a series of operations to reduce the integer to 1, either by dividing it by 2 if it's even or subtracting 1 if it's odd. The function then prints the number of operations required to reduce the integer to 1, followed by the sequence of operations performed in reverse order. The output is printed to the console, with each test case's output on a new line.**
