Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (the test cases). Each test case is a positive integer (X) such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a sequence of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations (t) required to reduce the corresponding input integer (X) to 1, followed by the sequence of integers (ans) that represent the operations performed to reduce X to 1. The sequence of integers is in reverse order, with the last operation performed first. The output state is printed to the console, with each test case's output on a new line.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a sequence of positive integers from standard input, where each integer represents a test case. For each test case, it performs a series of operations to reduce the integer to 1, either by dividing it by 2 if it's even or subtracting 1 if it's odd. The function then prints the number of operations required to reduce the integer to 1, followed by the sequence of operations performed in reverse order. The output is printed to the console, with each test case's output on a new line.
