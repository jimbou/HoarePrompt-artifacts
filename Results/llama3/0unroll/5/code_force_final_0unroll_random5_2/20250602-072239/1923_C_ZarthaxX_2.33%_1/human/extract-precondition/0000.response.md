Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is a list of positive integers. The two integers are the left and right borders of the subarray (1-indexed). The number of queries is equal to the second integer. The length of the list of integers is equal to the first integer.**
