Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of integers, and multiple queries. It then processes each test case by calculating the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the list minus the index. For each query, it determines whether a subarray within the given borders can be transformed into a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 1 by replacing some elements with 1. If such a transformation is possible, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
