Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray can be transformed into a "good" array as defined in the problem statement.

The program first calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the input list minus the index. This is done to efficiently calculate the number of 1's and the sum of the subarray for each query.

For each query, the program checks if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array by checking if the sum of the subarray minus the number of 1's is greater than or equal to the number of non-1 elements in the subarray. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for the subarray to be "good".

The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element, in which case it is not "good".

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
