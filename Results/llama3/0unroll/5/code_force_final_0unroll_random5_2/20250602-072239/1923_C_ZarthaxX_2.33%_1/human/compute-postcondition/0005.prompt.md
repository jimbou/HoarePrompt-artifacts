You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers is a list of positive integers. The two integers are the left and right borders of the subarray (1-indexed). The number of queries is equal to the second integer. The length of the list of integers is equal to the first integer.
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The ones list contains the cumulative count of 1's in the nums list, and the sum list contains the cumulative sum of the nums list minus the index.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The ones list contains the cumulative count of 1's in the nums list, and the sum list contains the cumulative sum of the nums list minus the index.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
