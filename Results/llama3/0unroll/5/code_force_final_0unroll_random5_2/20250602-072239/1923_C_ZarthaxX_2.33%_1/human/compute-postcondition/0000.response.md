Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, nums is a list of positive integers of length n, ones is a list of zeros of length n+1, sum is a list of zeros of length n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `q` are integers, and `nums` is a list of positive integers with a length equal to `n`. The lists `ones` and `sum` are initialized with zeros and have a length of `n+1`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been processed by the code.
