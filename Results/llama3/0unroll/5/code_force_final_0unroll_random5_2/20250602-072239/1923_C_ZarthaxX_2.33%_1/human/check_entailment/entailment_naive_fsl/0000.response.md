Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines whether a subarray is good or not based on the given conditions.

The program uses two auxiliary arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray, respectively. It then uses these arrays to calculate the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray for each query.

The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element, in which case it prints "NO". It also correctly handles the case where the subarray has more than one element, in which case it checks whether the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of ones in the subarray plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones. If this condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct for all potential cases and the answer is **True**.
