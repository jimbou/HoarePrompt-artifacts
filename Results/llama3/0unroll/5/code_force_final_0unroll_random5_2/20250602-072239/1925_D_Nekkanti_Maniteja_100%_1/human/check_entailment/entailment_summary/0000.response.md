Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the formula for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program uses the modular inverse to avoid overflow and calculates the sum of the products of the modular inverses of the number of pairs of nodes, the number of edges, and the sum of the frequencies of the edges, all taken modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each test case. The use of the modular inverse ensures that the program can handle large inputs without overflowing.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
