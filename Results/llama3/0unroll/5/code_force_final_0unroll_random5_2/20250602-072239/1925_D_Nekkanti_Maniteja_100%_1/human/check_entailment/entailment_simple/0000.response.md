Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. The program takes input from the user, processes it, and then outputs the result.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k). It also reads the indices of the pairs of friends and their friendship values.

The program calculates the modular inverse of the number of pairs of nodes (n * (n - 1) // 2) modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used to calculate the expected value.

The program then calculates the sum of the products of the modular inverses of the number of pairs of nodes, the number of edges, and the sum of the frequencies of the edges, all taken modulo 10^9 + 7.

Finally, the program prints the result for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions and outputs the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
