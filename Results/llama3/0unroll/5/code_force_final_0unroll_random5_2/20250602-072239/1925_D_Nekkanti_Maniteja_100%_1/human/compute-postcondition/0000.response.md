Output State: **The final state of the program after executing all iterations of the loop will be the sum of the products of the modular inverses of the number of pairs of nodes, the number of edges, and the sum of the frequencies of the edges, all taken modulo 10^9 + 7. The output will be a single integer value for each test case, representing the final state of the program after executing all iterations of the loop.**
