Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the calculation of the sum `s`. The program calculates `s` as `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, where `c` is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, `i` is the current excursion, `m` is the number of pairs of friends, and `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values. However, this calculation is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each excursion.

A correct calculation of `s` would involve summing up the expected value of the friendship value for each excursion, which would be `c * (a + i * m)` for each excursion `i`. The correct calculation of `s` would be `s = sum(c * (a + i * m) for i in range(k))`.

For example, if `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 10`, and the initial friendship value is `1`, the program would calculate `s` as `55`, but the correct calculation would be `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55`, which is correct. However, if `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 4`, and the initial friendship values are `1` and `2`, the program would calculate `s` as `777777784`, but the correct calculation would be `(1 + 2) + (2 + 3) + (3 + 4) + (4 + 5) = 20`, which is different from the program's output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
