Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the following input:

3 3
BBB
WBW
BBB

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The program only checks if the first and last rows are the same color, but it does not consider the case where the first and last columns are the same color but the rows are not.

In this case, the first and last columns are both "B", but the middle row is "WBW", which cannot be changed to all "B"s by any number of operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
