Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program checks the conditions where the first and last rows or columns are the same and contain only one type of character, and if they are different, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
