Functionality: **This function processes a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. It checks if the first and last rows of the grid are the same and contain only one type of character, or if the first and last columns are the same and contain only one type of character. If either condition is met and the first and last rows/columns are different, it prints 'NO', indicating that the grid does not meet the specified conditions. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function returns a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs, one for each test case.**
