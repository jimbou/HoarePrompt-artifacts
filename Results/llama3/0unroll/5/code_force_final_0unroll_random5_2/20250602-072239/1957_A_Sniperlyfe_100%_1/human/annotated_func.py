#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of integer division of the frequency of each integer in list 'arr' by 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of integer divisions of the frequency of each integer in the input list by 3. It takes a list of non-negative integers as input, counts the frequency of each integer, and then sums up the integer divisions of these frequencies by 3. The input list remains unchanged.
