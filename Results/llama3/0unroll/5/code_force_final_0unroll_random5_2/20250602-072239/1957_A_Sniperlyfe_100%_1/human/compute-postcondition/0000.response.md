Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing non-negative integers. The variable `freq` is now assigned an empty dictionary, which is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. Since no keys or values have been added to the dictionary, it remains empty.
