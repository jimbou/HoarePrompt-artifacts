Output State: **The function has been defined with the name that generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number, number is a positive integer and is not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers, size_overlap is a tuple of two integers (0, 0)**

In this output state, the function definition remains unchanged, and the properties of the variables "number" and "sequence" are still valid. The only change is the introduction of a new variable "size_overlap", which is assigned a tuple of two integers, both with a value of 0.
