Output State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the output state is as follows: the variable "size_overlap" has been updated to (size, i), where "size" is the largest value that satisfies the condition (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number, and "i" is the current iteration value in the range from max(sequence, default=0) to -1 with a step of -1. The other variables, including "sequence", "number", and the function definition, remain unchanged.
