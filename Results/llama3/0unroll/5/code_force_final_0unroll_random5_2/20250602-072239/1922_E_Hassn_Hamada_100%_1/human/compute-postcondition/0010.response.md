Output State: **The function `func_1` has been called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`, and the sequence has been extended by appending the numbers from `overlap` to `size - 1`. The loop has finished executing all iterations, the function has been defined with the name that generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number, number is a positive integer and is not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers, size_overlap is a tuple of two integers (size, i) where size is the maximum size of the sequence that can be generated from the input number and i is the index of the last element in the sequence that is less than or equal to the input number, size is the maximum size of the sequence that can be generated from the input number, and overlap is the index of the last element in the sequence that is less than or equal to the input number.**

In natural language, the output state means that the function `func_1` has been called with a new argument that is calculated based on the current values of `number`, `size`, and `overlap`. The sequence has been extended by appending new numbers from the `overlap` index to the `size - 1` index. The loop has finished executing all its iterations, and the function `func_1` is ready to generate a new sequence of numbers based on the input number. The values of `number`, `sequence`, `size_overlap`, `size`, and `overlap` remain the same, but the sequence has been updated by appending new numbers.
