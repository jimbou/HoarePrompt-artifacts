Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and extends the provided sequence list. If the input number is 0, returns 0, 0. Otherwise, it recursively generates a sequence of numbers by appending numbers to the sequence list, starting from the overlap index up to the maximum size that can be generated from the input number, until the input number becomes 0. The function returns the final state of the number (0) and the extended sequence list.
