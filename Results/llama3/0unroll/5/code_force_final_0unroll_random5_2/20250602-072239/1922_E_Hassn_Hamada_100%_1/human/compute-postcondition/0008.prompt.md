Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, the function has been defined with the name that generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number, number is a positive integer and is not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers, size_overlap is a tuple of two integers (size, i) where size is the maximum size of the sequence that can be generated from the input number and i is the index of the last element in the sequence that is less than or equal to the input number, size is the maximum size of the sequence that can be generated from the input number, and overlap is the index of the last element in the sequence that is less than or equal to the input number.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(size - overlap):
    sequence.append(i + overlap)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
