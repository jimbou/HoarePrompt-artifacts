Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. 

The problem description states that a triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater than 0. However, the program does not check if the three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. It simply calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3], the program will output 0, which is correct. However, if the input is [1, 1, 1], the program will output 35, which is incorrect. This is because the program does not check if the three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. In this case, the three sticks are the same length, so they cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. This can be done by checking if the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick. If this condition is not met, the three sticks cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

Here is an example of how the program can be modified to correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        if n >= 3:
            q = {}
            q = [0 for j in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n):
                q[w[j]] += 1
            eta = []
            for j in range(n + 1):
                if q[j] > 0:
                    eta.append(j)
            eta_ln = len(eta)
            rho = q[eta[0]]
            res = 0
            for j in range(eta_ln):
                for k in range(j + 1, eta_ln):
                    for l in range(k + 1, eta_ln):
                        if 2 ** eta[j] + 2 ** eta[k] > 2 ** eta[l] and 2 ** eta[j] + 2 ** eta[l] > 2 ** eta[k] and 2 ** eta[k] + 2 ** eta[l] > 2 ** eta[j]:
                            res += q[eta[j]] * q[eta[k]] * q[eta[l]]
                        if j == k:
                            res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * q[eta[l]] // 2
                        if j == l:
                            res += q[eta[j]] * q[eta[k]] * (q[eta[l]] - 1) // 2
                        if k == l:
                            res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[k]] - 1) * q[eta[l]] // 2
                        if j == k == l:
                            res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
            print(res)
        else:
            print(0)
```

This modified program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.
