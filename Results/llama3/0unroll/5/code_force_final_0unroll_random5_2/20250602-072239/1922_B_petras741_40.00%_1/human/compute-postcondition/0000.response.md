Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one: each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n).**

Explanation: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`, which represents the number of test cases. Since `t` is an integer, it can take any integer value. The second line initializes an empty list called `buffer`. The value of `buffer` is an empty list. No other variables are affected.
