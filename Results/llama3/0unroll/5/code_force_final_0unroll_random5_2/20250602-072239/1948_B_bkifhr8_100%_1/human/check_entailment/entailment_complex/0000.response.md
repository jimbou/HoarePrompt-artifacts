Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero).

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements `arr`.
3. It initializes a flag `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.
4. The program then iterates over the array in reverse order (from the second last element to the first element).
5. For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If so, it attempts to "split" the previous element into its digits and append the current element to the resulting list.
6. It checks if the resulting list is sorted in ascending order. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
7. Finally, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the "split" operation is not possible.

Correctness: **True**
