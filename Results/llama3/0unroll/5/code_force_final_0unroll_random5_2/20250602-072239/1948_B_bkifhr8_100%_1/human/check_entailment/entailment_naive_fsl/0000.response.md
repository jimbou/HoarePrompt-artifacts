Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The correct output should be "NO".

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the current element is less than the previous element, and if so, it tries to split the previous element into its digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order.

A correct approach would be to use a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a dynamic programming approach, to determine if the array can be made sorted in non-decreasing order.
