Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99). The values of the other variables are not affected.
