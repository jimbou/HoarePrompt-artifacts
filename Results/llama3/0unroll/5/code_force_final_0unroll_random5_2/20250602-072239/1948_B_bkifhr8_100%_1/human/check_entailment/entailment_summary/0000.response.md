Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times. 

The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning. If it finds a pair of elements that are not in non-decreasing order, it checks if the previous element can be split into digits and appended to the current element to make them sorted. If this is not possible, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. 

If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it means the array can be sorted by applying the operation, so it sets the answer to True. 

The program then prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
