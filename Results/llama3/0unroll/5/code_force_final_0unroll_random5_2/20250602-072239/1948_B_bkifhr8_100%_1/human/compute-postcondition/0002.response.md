Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then checks if the integers can be sorted in ascending order by repeatedly taking the last digit of the previous element and appending it to the current element. The function prints 'YES' if the sorting is possible and 'NO' otherwise, for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input buffer empty and the output buffer containing the results of all test cases.**
