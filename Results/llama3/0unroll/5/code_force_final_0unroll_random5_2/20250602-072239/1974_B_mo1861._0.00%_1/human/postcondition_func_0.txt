This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input, replaces each character with a corresponding character from the Latin alphabet based on its frequency in the input string (most frequent to 'a', second most frequent to 'b', and so on), and returns the resulting decoded string. The function does not modify the input string or any external state, and its only output is the decoded string.
