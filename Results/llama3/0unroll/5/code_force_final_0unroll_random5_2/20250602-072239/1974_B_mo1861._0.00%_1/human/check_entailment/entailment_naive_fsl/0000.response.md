Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The `func_1` function takes the encoded string `b` as input and creates a character map `char_map` that maps each unique character in `b` to its corresponding decoded character. The decoded character is determined by finding the character in the sorted set of unique characters in `b` that is at the same distance from the end of the alphabet as the original character is from the beginning of the alphabet.

2. The function then iterates over each character `c` in the encoded string `b` and appends the corresponding decoded character from the `char_map` to the decoded string `s`.

3. Finally, the function returns the decoded string `s`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order
* Strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters (although the problem statement specifies that the input will only contain lowercase letters)

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* An empty input string
* A single-character input string
* A string with only one unique character

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
