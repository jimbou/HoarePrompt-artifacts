Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a given string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. The decoding process involves replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`num_test_cases`) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the string `b` (`num_chars`) and the string `b` itself.
3.  The program then calls the function `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b` and prints the result.
4.  The `func_1(b)` function works as follows:

    *   It creates an empty dictionary `char_map` to store the mapping between characters in `b` and their corresponding symmetric characters in `r`.
    *   It iterates over the sorted set of characters in `b` (i.e., the distinct characters in alphabetical order) and maps each character to its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character is calculated by subtracting the current index `i` from the length of `b` minus 1 and adding the result to the ASCII value of 'a' using the `ord` function.
    *   It then initializes an empty string `s` to store the decoded string.
    *   The function iterates over each character `c` in `b` and appends its corresponding symmetric character from the `char_map` to the string `s`.
    *   Finally, the function returns the decoded string `s`.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
