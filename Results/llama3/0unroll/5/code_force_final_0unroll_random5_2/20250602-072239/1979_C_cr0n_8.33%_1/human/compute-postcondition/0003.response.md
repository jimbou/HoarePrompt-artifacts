Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 50, vals is an empty list, prod is the product of all integers in the initial vals list, vprod is an empty list, den is equal to prod.**

In this code block, the first line creates a new list `vprod` by iterating over the `vals` list and calculating the product of all integers in `vals` divided by each integer `r` in `vals`. However, since `vals` is an empty list, `vprod` will also be an empty list.

The second line calculates the value of `den` by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `prod`. Since `vprod` is an empty list, its sum is 0, and therefore `den` will be equal to `prod`.

The initial state of `N`, `vals`, and `prod` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The only new information is the creation of `vprod` and `den`, which are added to the output state.
