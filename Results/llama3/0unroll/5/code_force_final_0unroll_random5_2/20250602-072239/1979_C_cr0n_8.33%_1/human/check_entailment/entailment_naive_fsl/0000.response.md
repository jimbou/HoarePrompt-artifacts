Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a list of identical numbers. In this case, the program will output -1, but it should output a list of identical numbers.

For example, if the input is:

3
3 3 3

The program will output -1, but the correct output should be:

1 1 1

This is because the program is trying to find a solution where the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. However, when all the numbers are identical, this is not possible, and the program should output a list of identical numbers instead of -1.
