You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,...,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: Output State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, N is an integer between 1 and 50, vals is an empty list, prod is the product of all integers in the initial vals list.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of N remains an integer between 1 and 50, vals remains an empty list, prod remains the product of all integers in the initial vals list which is undefined since vals is empty, vprod remains an empty list, den remains less than or equal to 0, and -1 is still printed.
    #State: *N is an integer between 1 and 50, vals is an empty list, prod is the product of all integers in the initial vals list, vprod is an empty list, den is equal to prod and den is larger than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: (empty string)

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The value of N remains an integer between 1 and 50, vals remains an empty list, prod remains the product of all integers in the initial vals list which is undefined since vals is empty, vprod remains an empty list, den remains less than or equal to 0, and -1 is still printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
