Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program works by first calculating the product of all the multipliers (k_i) for each outcome. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the multiplier with respect to the product. This is done by dividing the product by each multiplier.

The program then checks if the denominator of the modular multiplicative inverse (which is the product minus the sum of the inverses) is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the modular multiplicative inverses of the multipliers, which represent the bets on each outcome.

The reasoning behind this approach is that if the product of the multipliers is greater than the sum of the inverses, then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This is because the product represents the total amount of coins that would be received back if all outcomes were winning, and the sum of the inverses represents the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem by finding a distribution of coins that satisfies the given conditions.
