Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, calculates the product of a list of integers, and then calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of each integer in the list. If the denominator of the modular multiplicative inverse is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1 and returns without printing the inverses. Otherwise, it prints the modular multiplicative inverses of the integers in the list. The function does not return any value.**
