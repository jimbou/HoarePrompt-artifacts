Functionality: **Determines if a list of non-negative integers can be rearranged to have a specific mean value.**

The function accepts a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a string indicating whether the list can be rearranged to have a specific mean value. If the sum of the list is not divisible by the length of the list, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it calculates the mean value and checks if the cumulative sum of the differences between each number and the mean ever becomes negative. If it does, the function returns 'NO'. If the cumulative sum remains non-negative, the function returns 'YES'. The input list remains unchanged throughout the process.
