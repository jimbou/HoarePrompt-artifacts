Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the sum of the numbers in the list is divisible by the length of the list. If it's not, the program returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same if the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers.

2. If the sum of the numbers is divisible by the length of the list, the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the list of numbers, calculating the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean amount. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, the program returns 'NO', which is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the mean amount.

4. If the program iterates over the entire list without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the previous containers to the current container. In this case, the program returns 'YES', which is correct.

Correctness: **True**
