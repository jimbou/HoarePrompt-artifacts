Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly checks if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The program first calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have. Then, it iterates through the list of containers and checks if it is possible to pour water from the current container to the next container to make the amount of water in the current container equal to the mean. If at any point it is not possible to pour water from the current container to the next container, the program returns 'NO'. If it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, the program returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
