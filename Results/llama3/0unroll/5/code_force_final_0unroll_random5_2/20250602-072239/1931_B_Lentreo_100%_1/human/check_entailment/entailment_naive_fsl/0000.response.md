Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, it immediately returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.

The program then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water level and the mean. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the mean level, so it returns 'NO'.

If the program finishes iterating through all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1 or where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers. It also correctly handles cases where the water levels in the containers are not initially equal.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
