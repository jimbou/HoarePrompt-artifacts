Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of nums, mean is the sum of nums divided by the length of nums, and curr is 0**

The code snippet calculates the mean of the list of non-negative integers `nums` by dividing the total sum `total` by the length `n`. The result is assigned to the variable `mean`. The variable `curr` is initialized to 0. The values of `nums`, `n`, and `total` remain unchanged.
