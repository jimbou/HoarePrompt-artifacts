Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the sum of the water amounts is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of the water amounts is divisible by the number of containers.

2. The program then calculates the mean water amount per container by dividing the total water amount by the number of containers.

3. The program iterates through the list of water amounts, calculating the cumulative difference between each amount and the mean. If the cumulative difference ever becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container have the mean amount of water.

4. If the program completes the iteration without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, so the program returns 'YES'.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
