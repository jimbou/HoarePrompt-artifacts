Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of nums, the sum of nums is divisible by the length of nums.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is the length of the list `nums`, and the value of `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. Since the sum of `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums` in the initial state, this property remains valid after the code execution. The code does not modify the list `nums` itself, so its properties as a list of non-negative integers also remain unchanged.
