Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input hour is '00'. According to the problem description, '00' should be converted to '12' and the time should be 'AM'. However, in the program, '00' is incorrectly assigned to 'PM'. 

For example, when the input is '00:59', the program will output '12:59 PM' instead of the correct output '12:59 AM'.
