Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way it handles the time '00:xx'. According to the 12-hour clock, '00:xx' should be '12:xx AM', but the program incorrectly outputs '12:xx PM'. 

Also, the program has a lot of repeated code, which can be simplified using conditional statements and arithmetic operations.

Correctness: **False**
