Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The program incorrectly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, it incorrectly assigns 'AM' or 'PM' to the hours. For example, it assigns 'AM' to '12' which should be 'PM'. Also, it incorrectly handles the conversion of hours greater than '12'. For example, it converts '13' to '01' which is correct but it assigns 'PM' to it which is correct, however, it does not handle the case when the hour is '00' correctly, it assigns 'PM' to it which is incorrect, it should assign 'AM' to it.

Correctness: **False**
