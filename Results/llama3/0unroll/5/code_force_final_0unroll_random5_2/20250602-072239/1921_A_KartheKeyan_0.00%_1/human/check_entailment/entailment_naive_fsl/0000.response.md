Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of increasing x-coordinates. The program assumes that the first two points are the bottom-left and bottom-right corners of the square, and the last two points are the top-left and top-right corners. However, this assumption is not always true.

For example, if the input coordinates are:

(1, 2)
(4, 5)
(1, 5)
(4, 2)

The program will calculate the distance between the first two points as the length of the side of the square, which is incorrect. The correct length of the side of the square is the distance between the points (1, 2) and (1, 5), or the points (4, 2) and (4, 5).

To fix this issue, the program should find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and y-coordinates among the four points, and then calculate the length of the side of the square as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates or y-coordinates.
