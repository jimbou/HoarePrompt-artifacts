Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains 4n lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000)**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, the while loop will run `n` times. The while loop does not affect the value of `n` directly, but it does consume `n` lines from stdin, each containing two integers `x` and `y`. After the while loop finishes, `n` lines have been consumed from stdin, leaving `4n` lines remaining, each containing two integers `x` and `y`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
