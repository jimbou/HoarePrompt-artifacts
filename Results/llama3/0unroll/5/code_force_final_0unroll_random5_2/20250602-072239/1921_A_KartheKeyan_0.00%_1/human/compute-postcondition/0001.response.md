Output State: **n is 0, stdin is empty, and the console contains the areas of n rectangles.**

In this output state, the variable n has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The stdin buffer is empty because all the input lines have been consumed by the loop. The console contains the areas of n rectangles, each calculated using the coordinates of the rectangle's vertices. The areas are printed in the order they were calculated, with each area on a new line.
