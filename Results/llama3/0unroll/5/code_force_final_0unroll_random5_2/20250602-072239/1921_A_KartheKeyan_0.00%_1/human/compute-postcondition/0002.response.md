Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the areas of rectangles given their coordinates. It reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of rectangles, and then reads 4t lines of coordinates (x, y) for each rectangle. The function calculates the area of each rectangle using the distance formula and prints the results. After processing all rectangles, the function leaves the standard input empty and the console containing the areas of the rectangles.**
