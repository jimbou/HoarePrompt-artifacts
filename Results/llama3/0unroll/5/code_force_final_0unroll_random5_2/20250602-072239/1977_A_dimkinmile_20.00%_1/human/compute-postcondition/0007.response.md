Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99), each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, 'Yes' is being printed. Otherwise, 'No' is being printed.***
