Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program reads the number of test cases (kreker) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

The program then checks if n is greater than or equal to m. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The reasoning behind this logic is that if n is greater than or equal to m, Nikita can always add m cubes to the tower in the first m moves and then remove any excess cubes in the remaining n-m moves. This ensures that the tower will have exactly m cubes after n moves.

Therefore, the given program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
