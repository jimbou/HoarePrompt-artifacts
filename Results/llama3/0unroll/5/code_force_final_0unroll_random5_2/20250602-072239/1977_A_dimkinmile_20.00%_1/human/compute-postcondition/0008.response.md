Functionality: **This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the standard input, compares their values, and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not modify the input values or the state of the standard input, but it consumes one line of input. The function's purpose is to determine and print whether the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer.**
