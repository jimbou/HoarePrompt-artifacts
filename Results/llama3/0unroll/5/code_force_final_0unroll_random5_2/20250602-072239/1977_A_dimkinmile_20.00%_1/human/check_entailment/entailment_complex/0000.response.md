Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program reads two integers n and m from the standard input and checks if n is greater than or equal to m. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The reasoning behind this solution is that if n is greater than or equal to m, it means that Nikita can add m cubes to the tower in m moves, and then remove (n-m) cubes in the remaining (n-m) moves. This would result in a tower with exactly m cubes.

On the other hand, if n is less than m, it means that Nikita cannot add m cubes to the tower, because he only has n moves available, which is less than m. Therefore, it is not possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves.

Based on this analysis, the given program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
