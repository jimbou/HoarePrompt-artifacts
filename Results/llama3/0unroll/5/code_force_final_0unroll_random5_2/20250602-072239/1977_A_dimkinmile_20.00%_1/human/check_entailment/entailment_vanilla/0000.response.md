Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

2. The given program defines a function func_1() that takes two integers n and m as input, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

3. The function checks if n is greater than or equal to m. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. The program then reads an integer kreker from the input, representing the number of test cases. It iterates over this range and calls func_1() for each test case.

5. However, the program is missing the definition of the function func_1() before it's called in the loop. This would result in a NameError because func_1 is not defined when it's called.

6. Even if the function definition was placed before the loop, the logic of the function is incorrect. The condition n >= m does not accurately determine if it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. The correct condition should be that the difference between n and m is even, because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to reach the desired height.

7. Therefore, the given program is incorrect due to both the function definition placement and the incorrect logic.

Correctness: **False**
