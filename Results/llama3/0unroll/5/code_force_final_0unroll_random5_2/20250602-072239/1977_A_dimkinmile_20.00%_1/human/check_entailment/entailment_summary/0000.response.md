Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The given program defines a function `func_1()` that reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, compares their values, and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and 'No' otherwise.

However, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The condition `n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The correct condition should be `n >= m` and `m` should be an odd number if `n` is odd, or `m` should be an even number if `n` is even.

For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the program will print 'Yes', but it's not possible to build a tower with exactly 2 cubes after 3 moves.

Correctness: **False**
