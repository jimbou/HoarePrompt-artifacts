Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if n is odd and m is even, the program will print 'Yes' even though it's not possible to end up with an even number of cubes after an odd number of moves. 

A correct solution would be to check if the difference between n and m is even, because Nikita can only end up with m cubes if he puts m cubes on top of the tower and then removes (n-m) cubes, and this can only be done if (n-m) is even. 

Here is a correct implementation:

```
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
