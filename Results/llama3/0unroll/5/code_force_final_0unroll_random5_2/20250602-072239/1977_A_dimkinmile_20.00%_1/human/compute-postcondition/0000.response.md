Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99), each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to be integers between 1 and 100, as they are assigned the values from the input. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed, so the number of lines remaining is t-1. The remaining lines still contain two integers each, with the same range of values.
