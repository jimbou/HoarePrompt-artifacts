Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It checks the conditions for a stair (a < b < c) and a peak (a < b > c) and prints the corresponding output. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the digits are equal (e.g., 0 0 0) or where the digits do not form a stair or a peak (e.g., 4 1 7). The program's logic is straightforward and easy to follow, and it does not contain any obvious errors or omissions.

Therefore, based on the provided program and problem description, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements.
