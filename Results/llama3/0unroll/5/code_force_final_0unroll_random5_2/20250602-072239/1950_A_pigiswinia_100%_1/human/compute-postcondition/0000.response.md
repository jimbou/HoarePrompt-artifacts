Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t lines each containing three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 1000. The remaining inputs in stdin are still valid, containing t lines each with three digits (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).
