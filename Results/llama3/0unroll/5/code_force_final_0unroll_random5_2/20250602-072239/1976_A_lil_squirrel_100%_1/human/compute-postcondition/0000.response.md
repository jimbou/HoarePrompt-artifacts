Output State: **n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is an empty list, digits is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists, `letters` and `digits`, but does not modify the existing variables `n` and `password`. Therefore, the final state includes the unchanged values of `n` and `password`, as well as the newly created empty lists `letters` and `digits`.
