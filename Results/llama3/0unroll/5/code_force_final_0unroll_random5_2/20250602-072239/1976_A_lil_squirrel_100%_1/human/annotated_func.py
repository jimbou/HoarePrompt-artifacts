#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)

    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'
    #State: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string. The list of letters is sorted in ascending order.

    #State: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string. The list of letters is sorted in ascending order. The list of digits is sorted in ascending order.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop does not return 'NO' and finishes all iterations, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES'

#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if a given password string meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' if it does, or 'NO' otherwise. The conditions are: (1) the letters in the password are in sorted order, (2) the digits in the password are in sorted order, and (3) there are no instances where a letter is immediately followed by a digit. The function takes a password string as input and returns a string indicating whether the password is valid ('YES') or not ('NO').
