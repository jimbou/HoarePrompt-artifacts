Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if there are no digits after letters, if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, and if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program first separates the letters and digits from the password and checks if they are sorted. If not, it returns 'NO'. Then it checks if there are any digits after letters in the password. If there are, it returns 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all the conditions and edge cases, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with a mix of letters and digits. Therefore, the program is correct.
