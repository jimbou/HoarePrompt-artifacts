Functionality: **The function checks if a given password string meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' if it does, or 'NO' otherwise. The conditions are: (1) the letters in the password are in sorted order, (2) the digits in the password are in sorted order, and (3) there are no instances where a letter is immediately followed by a digit. The function takes a password string as input and returns a string indicating whether the password is valid ('YES') or not ('NO').**
