Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly checks all the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness of the program:

1. The program first separates the letters and digits from the password into two separate lists.
2. It then checks if the list of letters is sorted in ascending order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
3. Next, it checks if the list of digits is sorted in ascending order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. After that, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program correctly implements all the conditions for a strong password and returns the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
