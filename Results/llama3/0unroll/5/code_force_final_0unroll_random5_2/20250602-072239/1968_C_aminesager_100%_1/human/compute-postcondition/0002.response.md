Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n-1 integers. For each test case, it generates a list of n integers, where each integer is the cumulative sum of the previous integer and the corresponding input integer, starting with an initial value of 1000. The function then prints the generated list for each test case.**
