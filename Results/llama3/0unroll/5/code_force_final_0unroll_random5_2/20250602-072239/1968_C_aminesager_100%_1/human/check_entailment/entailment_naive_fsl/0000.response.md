Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program initializes the first element of the array `a` to 1000, which is within the allowed range of 1 to 10^9. Then, for each subsequent element, it calculates the value as the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element in the input array `T`. This ensures that the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` is satisfied for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

The program also handles the edge case where `n` is 2, in which case the output is simply `1000` and `1000 + T[0]`, which satisfies the condition.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
