Output State: **The loop will execute 't' number of times, and for each execution, it will print a list of 'n' integers, where each integer is the sum of the previous integer and the corresponding input integer from the list 'T'. The initial value of the list 'a' is [1000], and for each iteration of the loop, the list 'a' is updated by appending the sum of the last element of 'a' and the corresponding input integer from 'T'.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop will run 't' times, and for each run, it will print a list of 'n' integers. The list starts with 1000, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous number and the corresponding input number from the list 'T'.
