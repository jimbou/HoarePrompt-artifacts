Reasoning: 
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed or not. It first sorts the list of cube values in descending order, then checks the value of the kth largest cube (which is the kth element in the sorted list) against the value of the favorite cube. If the kth largest cube is greater than the favorite cube, it prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite cube will not be removed. If the kth largest cube is less than the favorite cube, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed. If the kth largest cube is equal to the favorite cube, it checks if the kth largest cube is the last cube in the sorted list (i.e., k == n - 1) or if the cube before it is less than the favorite cube. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. This logic correctly covers all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
