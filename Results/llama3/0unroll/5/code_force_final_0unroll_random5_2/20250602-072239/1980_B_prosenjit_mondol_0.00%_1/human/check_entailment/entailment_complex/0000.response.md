Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`.
2.  It subtracts 1 from `f` to convert it to a 0-based index, which is correct because Python uses 0-based indexing.
3.  It subtracts 1 from `k` to convert it to a 0-based index, which is correct because Python uses 0-based indexing.
4.  It reads the list of integers `a` and stores the value at index `f` in the variable `x`.
5.  It sorts the list `a` in descending order using the `sort` method with the `reverse=True` argument.
6.  It checks the value at index `k` in the sorted list `a` and compares it with the value `x`.
    *   If the value at index `k` is greater than `x`, it prints 'NO' because the favorite cube will not be removed.
    *   If the value at index `k` is less than `x`, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube will be removed.
    *   If the value at index `k` is equal to `x`, it checks if `k` is equal to `n - 1` (i.e., the last index) or if the value at index `k - 1` is less than `x`. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES' because the favorite cube will be removed. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
