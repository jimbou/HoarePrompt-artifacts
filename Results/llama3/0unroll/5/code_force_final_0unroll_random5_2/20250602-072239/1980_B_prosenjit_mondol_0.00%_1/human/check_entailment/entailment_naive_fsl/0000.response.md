Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the cube at the k-th position after sorting, and there are other cubes with the same value that are not removed. In this case, the program prints 'YES', but the correct answer should be 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on its position among the cubes with the same value.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program prints 'YES', but the correct answer is 'MAYBE' because the favorite cube (with value 3) may or may not be removed depending on its position among the three cubes with value 3.
