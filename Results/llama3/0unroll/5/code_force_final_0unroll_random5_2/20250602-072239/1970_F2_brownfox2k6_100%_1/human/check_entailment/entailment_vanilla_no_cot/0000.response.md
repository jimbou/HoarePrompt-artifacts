Correctness: **False** 

The provided program does not fully implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. It seems to be missing the main game loop, the handling of player actions (catching and throwing the Quaffle), and the scoring logic. The program only includes two functions: `func_1` which updates the position of an object based on a direction, and `func_2` which handles player elimination by the Bludger. However, the main game logic is not implemented. 

To fully solve the problem, the program would need to read the input, initialize the game state, and then iterate over the actions, updating the game state accordingly. It would also need to handle the scoring logic and print the final score. 

Therefore, the provided program is not correct.
