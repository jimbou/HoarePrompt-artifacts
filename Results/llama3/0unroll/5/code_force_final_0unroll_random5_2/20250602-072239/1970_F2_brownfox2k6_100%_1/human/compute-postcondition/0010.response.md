Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, where the y-coordinate is increased by 1, and `d` is 'R'.**

In this output state, the value of `obj` has been updated such that its y-coordinate (represented by `obj[1]`) has been incremented by 1. The value of `d` remains unchanged, still representing the direction 'R'.
