Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, and `d` is a string representing a direction (L or R) in which the object moves. If `d` is 'L', the y-coordinate of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the y-coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is neither 'L' nor 'R', no changes are made to `obj`.***
