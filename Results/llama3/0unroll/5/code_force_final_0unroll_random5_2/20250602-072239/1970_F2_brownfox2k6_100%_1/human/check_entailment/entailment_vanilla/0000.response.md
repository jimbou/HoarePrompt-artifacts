Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be a part of a larger program that simulates a game of Quidditch. The two functions provided, `func_1` and `func_2`, seem to be responsible for moving objects on the field and handling player elimination, respectively.

Function `func_1` takes an object's position and a direction as input and updates the object's position accordingly. This function seems to be correct, as it properly handles the four possible directions (up, down, left, and right).

Function `func_2` takes a time step as input and checks if any players have been eliminated by the Bludger. If a player has been eliminated, it prints the corresponding message and updates the player's position to [-1, -1]. This function also seems to be correct, as it properly handles player elimination and prints the required message.

However, there are a few issues with the provided program:

1. The program does not handle the case where a player scores a goal. It only handles player elimination.
2. The program does not update the Quaffle's position when a player throws it.
3. The program does not handle the case where a player catches the Quaffle.
4. The program does not keep track of the score.

Therefore, the provided program is not a complete solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
