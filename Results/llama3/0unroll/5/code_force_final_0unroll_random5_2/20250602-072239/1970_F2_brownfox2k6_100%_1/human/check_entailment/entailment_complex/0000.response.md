Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to simulate a game of Quidditch, where two teams, Gryffindor (R) and Ravenclaw (B), compete to score points by throwing the Quaffle into the opponent's goal. The program takes input from the user, including the size of the field, the initial positions of the players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger, and the actions performed by the entities on the field.

The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` moves an object on the field in a specified direction, updating its coordinates accordingly. `func_2` identifies and eliminates players who are at the same position as the Bludger on the field.

The program correctly implements the rules of the game, including:

* Moving entities on the field based on the input actions
* Updating the positions of players, Quaffle, and Bludger accordingly
* Eliminating players who are at the same position as the Bludger
* Scoring points when a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal
* Printing the final score at the end of the game

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* Preventing players from moving outside the field boundaries
* Ensuring that the Quaffle is not thrown into a goal that is already occupied by a player
* Eliminating players who are at the same position as the Bludger, even if they are carrying the Quaffle

Overall, the program is well-structured, readable, and correctly implements the rules of the game.

Correctness: **True**
