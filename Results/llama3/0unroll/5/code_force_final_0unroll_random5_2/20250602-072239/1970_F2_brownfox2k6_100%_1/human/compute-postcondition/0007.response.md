Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, where the y-coordinate is one less than its initial value, and the current value of `d` is 'L', representing the direction in which the object moves.**

In natural language, this means that the object has moved one step down in the y-direction, while its x-coordinate remains unchanged, and the direction of movement is still 'L' (left).
