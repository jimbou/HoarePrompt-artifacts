Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time, `player` is a dictionary where keys are player names (e.g. 'R0', 'B0') and values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, `out` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `player`, and `blud` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `out` and assigned it an empty list.
