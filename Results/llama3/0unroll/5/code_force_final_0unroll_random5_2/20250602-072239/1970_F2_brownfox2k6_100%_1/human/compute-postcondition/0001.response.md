Output State: The output state is a dictionary where the keys are player names and the values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field. The players who were hit by the Bludger (i.e., their position was the same as the Bludger's position) have their position set to [-1, -1]. The list `out` contains the names of the players who were hit by the Bludger. The time `t` and the Bludger's position `blud` remain unchanged.
