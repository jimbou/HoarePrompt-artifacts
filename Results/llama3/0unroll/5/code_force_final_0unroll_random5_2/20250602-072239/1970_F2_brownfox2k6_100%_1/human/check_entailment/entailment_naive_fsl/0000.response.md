Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when a player scores in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in the wrong goal, the other team wins a point. However, the program does not check for this case and does not update the score accordingly.

For example, if the input is:

3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T

The program will print:

4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1

However, according to the problem description, since R0 scored in the red goal, the blue team should win a point, and the final score should be:

FINAL SCORE: 0 1

But the program does not handle this case correctly.

Also, the program does not check if the Quaffle is being carried by a player when it is thrown. According to the problem description, if a player is carrying the Quaffle and throws it, the Quaffle should be put at the current position of the player. However, the program does not check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before throwing it.

For example, if the input is:

3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 T

The program will print:

1 R0 ELIMINATED
FINAL SCORE: 0 0

However, according to the problem description, since R0 is not carrying the Quaffle, it should not be able to throw it, and the program should not print "R0 ELIMINATED".

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
