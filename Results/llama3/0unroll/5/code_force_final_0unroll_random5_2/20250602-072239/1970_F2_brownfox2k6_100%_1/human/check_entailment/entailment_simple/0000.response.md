Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to simulate a game of Quidditch, where two teams, Gryffindor (R) and Ravenclaw (B), compete to score points by throwing the Quaffle into the opponent's goal. The program takes input from the user, including the size of the field, the initial positions of the players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger, and a sequence of actions performed by the entities on the field.

The program correctly implements the rules of the game, including the movement of players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger, as well as the scoring of points and the elimination of players who come into contact with the Bludger.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to update the positions of the entities on the field and to check for collisions between players and the Bludger. The `func_1` function updates the position of an entity based on the direction of movement, and the `func_2` function checks for collisions between players and the Bludger and updates the positions of the players accordingly.

The program also correctly handles the scoring of points, including the case where a player scores in their own goal, which results in the opposing team scoring a point.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for a given set of inputs.

Correctness: **True**
