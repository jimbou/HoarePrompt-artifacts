Postcondition: ***obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field. If d is 'U', the x-coordinate of obj is decreased by 1. If d is 'D', the x-coordinate of obj is increased by 1. If d is 'L', the y-coordinate of obj is decreased by 1. If d is 'R', the y-coordinate of obj is increased by 1. If d is neither 'U', 'D', 'L', nor 'R', no changes are made to obj.***
