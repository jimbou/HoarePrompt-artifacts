#Overall this is what the function does:Moves an object on a field in a specified direction, updating its coordinates accordingly. The function takes a list of two integers representing the object's current coordinates and a string representing the direction (U, D, L, or R) as input. It then modifies the coordinates based on the direction: moving up (U) decreases the x-coordinate by 1, moving down (D) increases the x-coordinate by 1, moving left (L) decreases the y-coordinate by 1, and moving right (R) increases the y-coordinate by 1. If the direction is not one of the specified options, the coordinates remain unchanged. The function returns the updated coordinates.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer representing the current time, player is a dictionary where keys are player names (e.g. 'R0', 'B0') and values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field.
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `t` remains unchanged, `player` dictionary is updated such that the positions of players who were at the same position as the Bludger are set to [-1, -1], `blud` remains unchanged, and `out` contains the names of players who were at the same position as the Bludger.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `t` remains unchanged, `player` dictionary is updated such that the positions of players who were at the same position as the Bludger are set to [-1, -1], `blud` remains unchanged, and `out` contains the names of players who were at the same position as the Bludger.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function identifies and eliminates players who are at the same position as the Bludger on the field. It takes in the current time, a dictionary of player positions, and the Bludger's position as input. The function updates the player positions by setting the eliminated players' positions to [-1, -1] and returns a list of eliminated player names. It also prints the time and name of each eliminated player. The function does not modify the Bludger's position or the current time.
