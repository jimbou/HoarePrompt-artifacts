This function identifies and eliminates players who are at the same position as the Bludger on the field. It takes in the current time, a dictionary of player positions, and the Bludger's position as input. The function updates the player positions by setting the eliminated players' positions to [-1, -1] and returns a list of eliminated player names. It also prints the time and name of each eliminated player. The function does not modify the Bludger's position or the current time.
