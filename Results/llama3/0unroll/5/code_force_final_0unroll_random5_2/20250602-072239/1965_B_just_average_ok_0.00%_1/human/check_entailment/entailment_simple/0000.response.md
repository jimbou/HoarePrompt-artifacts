Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that there is no subsequence with a sum of k, and for all 1 ≤ v ≤ n where v ≠ k, there is a subsequence with a sum of v.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases t and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k.

The program then initializes a list nums with 24 powers of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^23). It finds the largest power of 2 that is less than k and stores its index in the variable idx.

The program then appends three new elements to the list nums: k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1. It removes the element at index idx from the list.

Finally, the program prints the length of the list nums and its elements.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the sum of any subset of the powers of 2 is unique. By including all powers of 2 up to 2^23, the program ensures that all sums from 1 to 2^24 - 1 are covered. The three additional elements appended to the list (k - nums[idx], k + 1, and k + nums[idx] + 1) are chosen such that they do not form a subsequence with a sum of k, but do form subsequences with sums of all other values from 1 to n.

The program's output is in the correct format, with the length of the list nums followed by its elements.

Correctness: **True**
