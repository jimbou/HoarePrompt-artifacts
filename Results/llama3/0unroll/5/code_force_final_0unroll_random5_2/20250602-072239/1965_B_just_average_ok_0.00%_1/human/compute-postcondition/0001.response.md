Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of numbers based on the given k and calculates new values by performing bitwise operations and arithmetic additions. The function then prints the length of the resulting list and its elements. The output for each test case is a list of four numbers, which are the calculated values based on the input k. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.**
