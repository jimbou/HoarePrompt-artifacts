Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads three integers n, a, and b, representing the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

The program then calculates the minimum cost by comparing the product of n and a (the regular price) with the product of n and half of b (the promotion price), rounded to the nearest integer. The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the minimum cost as the minimum between the product of n and a, and the product of n and half of b, rounded to the nearest integer. This is incorrect because the promotion price is for two yogurts, not one. Therefore, the correct calculation should be the minimum between the product of n and a, and the product of the integer division of n by 2 (rounded down) and b, plus the product of the remainder of n divided by 2 and a.

Correctness: **False**
