Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of yogurts (a) is odd. In this case, the program will round up the total cost, which is not the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend. For example, if a = 3, b = 5, and c = 9, the program will print 15, but the correct answer is 14 (buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price).
