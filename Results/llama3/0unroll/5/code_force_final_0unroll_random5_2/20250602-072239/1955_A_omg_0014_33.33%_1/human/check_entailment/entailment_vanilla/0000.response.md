Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.

3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

4. The program calculates `d` as half of the promotion price `c`, which represents the effective price per yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotion price.

5. It then compares the total cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price (`a * b`) with the total cost of buying `a` yogurts at the effective promotion price (`a * d`).

6. If the total cost at the regular price is less than the total cost at the promotion price, it prints the total cost at the regular price (`a * b`). Otherwise, it prints the total cost at the promotion price (`a * d`), rounded to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.

7. The program repeats this process for each test case.

8. However, there is a logical error in the program. When `a` is odd, buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price is not possible, as the promotion is for two yogurts. In such cases, the program should calculate the cost of buying `a - 1` yogurts at the promotion price and add the cost of one yogurt at the regular price.

9. The program does not handle this case correctly, which leads to incorrect results for test cases where `a` is odd.

Correctness: **False**
