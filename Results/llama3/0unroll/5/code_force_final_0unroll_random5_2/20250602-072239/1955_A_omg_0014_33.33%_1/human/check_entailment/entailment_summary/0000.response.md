Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by comparing the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) with the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), where d is half of the promotion price (c / 2). If the cost of buying at the regular price is less than the cost of buying at the promotion price, it prints the regular price; otherwise, it prints the promotion price rounded to the nearest integer.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not consider the case where n is odd. In this case, Maxim cannot buy all yogurts at the promotion price, and the program should calculate the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price and the rest at the promotion price.

Correctness: **False**
