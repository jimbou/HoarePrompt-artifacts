The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the first line of the input contains the integer `t`, which is between 1 and 10^4, the value of `n` will be equal to `t`.

The remaining `t` lines in the input contain three integers each, but they are not read by this code snippet. Therefore, the input state is updated to reflect that there are now `t` lines remaining in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers.**
