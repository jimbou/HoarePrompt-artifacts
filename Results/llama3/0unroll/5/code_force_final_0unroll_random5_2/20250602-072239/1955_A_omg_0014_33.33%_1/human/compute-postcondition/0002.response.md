Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers a, b, and c, and prints the minimum value between the product of a and b, and the product of a and half of c, rounded to the nearest integer. The function performs this calculation for t test cases and prints the results, leaving the value of t unchanged.**
