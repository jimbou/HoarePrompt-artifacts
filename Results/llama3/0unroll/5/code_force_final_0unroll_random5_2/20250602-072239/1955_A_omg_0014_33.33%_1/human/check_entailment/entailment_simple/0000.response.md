Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b) as inputs.

The program first calculates the price of one yogurt if bought at the promotion price (d = c / 2). Then, it compares the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) with the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d). The program prints the minimum of these two costs.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program should compare the total cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n) with the total cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d * 2), not (a * d). The correct comparison should be between (a * n) and (a * d * 2) if n is even, and between (a * n) and ((a * d * 2) + a) if n is odd.

Correctness: **False**
