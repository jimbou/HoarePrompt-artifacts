This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a number of cities, their coordinates, a number of queries, and query pairs of city indices. For each query, it calculates the minimum distance between the two cities by considering two paths: one in ascending order of city coordinates and one in descending order. The function then prints the minimum distance for each query.
