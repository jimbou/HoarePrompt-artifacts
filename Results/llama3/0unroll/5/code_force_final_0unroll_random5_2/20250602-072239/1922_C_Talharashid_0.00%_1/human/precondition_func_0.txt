stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique non-decreasing integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is the number of cities, the list of integers represents the coordinates of the cities, the second integer is the number of queries, and the list of pairs of integers represents the queries, where each pair contains two different city indices.
