Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique non-decreasing integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is the number of cities, the list of integers represents the coordinates of the cities, the second integer is the number of queries, and the list of pairs of integers represents the queries, where each pair contains two different city indices.**

In natural language, the output state is that `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case, but the structure of each test case remains the same, with four inputs: the number of cities, the list of city coordinates, the number of queries, and the list of query pairs.
