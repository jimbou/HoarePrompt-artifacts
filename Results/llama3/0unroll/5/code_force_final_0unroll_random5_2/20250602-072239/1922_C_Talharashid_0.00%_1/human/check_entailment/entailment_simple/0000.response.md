Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another city. 

The program first calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to all other cities in both forward and backward directions. It uses two dictionaries, d1 and d2, to store the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the first city to each city in the forward and backward directions, respectively. 

Then, for each query, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the start city to the end city by comparing the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the start city to the end city in both forward and backward directions. 

The program correctly handles the case where the start city is less than the end city and the case where the start city is greater than the end city. 

The time complexity of the program is O(n + m), where n is the number of cities and m is the number of queries. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of cities. 

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
