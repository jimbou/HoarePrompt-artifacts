Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move, and that player loses. The problem asks us to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The program then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", otherwise it prints "Alice".

The key insight here is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check. If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, then no matter how the players exchange wallets and remove coins, the sum will always remain even. This means that Alice, who makes the first move, will always be forced to make a move that leaves an even number of coins in her wallet. Since Bob makes the second move, he will always have an opportunity to make a move that leaves an odd number of coins in his wallet, ultimately winning the game.

On the other hand, if the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, then Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of coins in her wallet, forcing Bob to make a move that leaves an even number of coins in his wallet. This will ultimately lead to Alice winning the game.

Therefore, the program's logic is correct, and it will correctly determine the winner of the game for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
