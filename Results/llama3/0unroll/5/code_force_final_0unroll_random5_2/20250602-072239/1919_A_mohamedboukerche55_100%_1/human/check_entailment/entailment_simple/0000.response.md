Reasoning:

The problem states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move involves choosing to exchange wallets with their opponent or keeping their current wallet, and then removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The given program determines the winner of the game based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the sum of the coins in both wallets remains constant throughout the game, and the game ends when one of the wallets is empty.

The key insight here is that the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner of the game. If the sum is even, Bob can always make a valid move by choosing to exchange wallets or keeping his current wallet, and then removing 1 coin. On the other hand, if the sum is odd, Alice can always make a valid move by choosing to exchange wallets or keeping her current wallet, and then removing 1 coin.

Therefore, the given program is correct, and the output will correctly determine the winner of the game based on the input.

Correctness: **True**
