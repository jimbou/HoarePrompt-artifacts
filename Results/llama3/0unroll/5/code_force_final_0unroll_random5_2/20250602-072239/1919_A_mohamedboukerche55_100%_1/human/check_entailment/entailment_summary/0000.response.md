Reasoning: 
The problem states that the game is won by the player who can make the last valid move. A valid move consists of either swapping wallets or keeping the current wallet, followed by removing one coin from the current wallet. The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the total number of coins, which is the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the player who makes the last move will be the one who has an odd number of coins left, and since the total number of coins is even, it is Bob's turn.

Correctness: **True**
