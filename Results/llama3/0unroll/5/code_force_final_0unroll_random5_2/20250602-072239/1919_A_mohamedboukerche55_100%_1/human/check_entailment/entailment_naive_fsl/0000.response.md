Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine who will win the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The program uses the fact that if the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win, and if it is odd, Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will make the last move. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of coins, forcing him to make the last move.

The program correctly implements this logic by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check the parity of the total number of coins. If the result is 0, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
