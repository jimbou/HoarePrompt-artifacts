Reasoning:

The problem states that Alice and Bob take turns playing a game where they can either exchange wallets or keep their current wallets, and then remove 1 coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses.

The given program uses the fact that the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets determines the winner of the game. If the sum is even, Bob wins, and if the sum is odd, Alice wins.

Here's why this works:

* If the sum of the coins is even, Alice will always be left with an even number of coins after her turn. Since she can only remove 1 coin from her wallet, she will always have an even number of coins left. This means that Bob will always have an odd number of coins left after his turn, and he will always be able to make a valid move. Therefore, Bob will win the game.
* If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice will always be left with an odd number of coins after her turn. Since she can only remove 1 coin from her wallet, she will always have an odd number of coins left. This means that Bob will always have an even number of coins left after his turn, and he will not always be able to make a valid move. Therefore, Alice will win the game.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of the coins is even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If the sum is even, it prints "Bob", and if the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

Correctness: **True**
