Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result. The logic for determining who will win the game is also correct. The program checks if the count of 'U's in the string is odd or even. If it's odd, Alice will win; if it's even, Bob will win. This is because if there are an odd number of 'U's, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of 'U's, and vice versa. This will continue until one player has no 'U's left, at which point they will lose.

Correctness: **True**
