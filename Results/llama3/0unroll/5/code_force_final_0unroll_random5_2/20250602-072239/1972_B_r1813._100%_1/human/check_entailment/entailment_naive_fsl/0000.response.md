Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The problem description states that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win. However, the program only checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. This does not take into account the actual game logic, where players remove a coin and flip the adjacent coins.

A counterexample is the input "4 UUUU". The program will print 'YES', but according to the game logic, Bob will win this game because he can remove the first coin and flip the adjacent coins, leaving Alice with no move.

The correct solution should simulate the game and determine the winner based on the actual game logic, not just the parity of the number of 'U's.
