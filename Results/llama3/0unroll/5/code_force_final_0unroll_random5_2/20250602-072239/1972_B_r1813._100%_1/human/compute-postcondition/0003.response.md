Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of 'U's and 'D's. It then determines whether the count of 'U's in each string is odd or even and prints 'YES' if odd and 'NO' if even, repeating this process for each test case. The function does not modify the input or standard input stream.**
