Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then splits the string into parts separated by '-' and calculates the total length of the parts.

The function `func_1` is used to calculate the minimum possible penalty. It iterates over the characters in the string, maintaining a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the balance is positive.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is called with the original expression and the result length, but it does not use the result length correctly. The result length is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the parts separated by '-', but this is not the correct way to calculate the minimum possible penalty.

The correct approach would be to calculate the total sum of the array and then find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays with a sum of 0 or as close to 0 as possible.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
