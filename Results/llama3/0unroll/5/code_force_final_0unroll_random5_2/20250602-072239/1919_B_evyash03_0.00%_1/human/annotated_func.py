#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a positive integer and equals the length of expression.
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: Output State: The final balance is the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the expression, and the count is the number of times the balance became negative during the loop execution.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the total count of the number of times the balance became negative during the loop execution plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise, it returns the count of the number of times the balance became negative during the loop execution.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the total number of times a balance becomes negative while iterating through a string of '+' and '-' characters, and returns this count plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise returns the count.
