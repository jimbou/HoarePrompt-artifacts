Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty. The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented. It seems to be trying to count the number of times the balance goes below 0, but this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

A correct approach would be to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, and then calculate the absolute difference between the counts. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    plus_count = expression.count('+')
    minus_count = expression.count('-')
    print(abs(plus_count - minus_count))
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then calculating the absolute difference between the counts.
