Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays with non-negative sums.

The function `func_1` iterates through the string `expression` and maintains a balance of the number of '+' and '-' characters encountered so far. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise, it returns the count.

This logic is correct because it ensures that the subarrays have non-negative sums, which minimizes the penalty. The count of negative balances represents the number of subarrays that need to be split, and adding 1 to the count if the final balance is positive ensures that the last subarray is also counted.

The main program correctly reads the input, splits the string into parts separated by '-', calculates the length of the result, and calls the function `func_1` with the correct arguments.

Therefore, the program produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
