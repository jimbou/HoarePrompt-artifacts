Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty for the given string of '+' and '-' characters.

The function `func_1` iterates through the string, maintaining a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. This effectively splits the string into subarrays with non-negative sums. The final balance represents the sum of the last subarray.

The function then returns the count of negative balances (which represents the number of subarrays with negative sums) plus 1 if the final balance is positive (which represents the last subarray with a positive sum). This correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description.

The main part of the program correctly reads the input, splits the string into parts separated by '-', calculates the length of the result, and calls the `func_1` function with the correct arguments.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
