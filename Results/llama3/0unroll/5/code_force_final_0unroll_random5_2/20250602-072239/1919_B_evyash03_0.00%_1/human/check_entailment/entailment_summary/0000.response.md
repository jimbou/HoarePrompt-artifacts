Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty. The function `func_1` iterates through the string `expression` and maintains a balance of '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise returns the count.

The main part of the program reads the input, splits the string into parts separated by '-', calculates the length of the result, and calls `func_1` with the expression and the result length. The result of `func_1` is then printed.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the `func_1` function.

Correctness: **True**
