Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, prefix is a list containing a single element 0**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since stdin initially contains an integer t followed by t test cases, after reading the first integer, stdin now contains t-1 test cases. The second line reads n integers from stdin and assigns them to arr. Since n is between 1 and 10^5, and each integer is between 1 and 10^9, arr becomes a list of n integers within this range. The third line initializes prefix as a list containing a single element 0. No other variables are affected.
