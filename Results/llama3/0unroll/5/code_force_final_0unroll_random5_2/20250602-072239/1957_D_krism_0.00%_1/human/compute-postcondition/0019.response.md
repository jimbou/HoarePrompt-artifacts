Output: **The value of suf[j][0] is incremented by the number of times the jth bit is 0 in the binary representation of prefix[i] for all i in the range 1 to n, and the value of suf[j][1] is incremented by the number of times the jth bit is 1 in the binary representation of prefix[i] for all i in the range 1 to n, and the value of pre is printed, and suf is printed, and ans is the sum of the products of the number of times the jth bit is 0 in the binary representation of prefix[i] and the number of times the jth bit is 0 in the binary representation of prefix[i] for all i in the range 1 to n, and the number of times the jth bit is 1 in the binary representation of prefix[i] and the number of times the jth bit is 1 in the binary representation of prefix[i] for all i in the range 1 to n, and ans is printed**
