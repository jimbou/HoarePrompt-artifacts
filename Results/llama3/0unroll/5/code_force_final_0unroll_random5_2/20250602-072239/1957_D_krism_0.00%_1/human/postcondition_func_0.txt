This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result to stdout. It takes an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, where each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function calculates the sum of the products of the number of times the jth bit is 0 in the binary representation of prefix[i] and the number of times the jth bit is 0 in the binary representation of prefix[i] for all i in the range 1 to n, and the number of times the jth bit is 1 in the binary representation of prefix[i] and the number of times the jth bit is 1 in the binary representation of prefix[i] for all i in the range 1 to n. The result is printed to stdout.
