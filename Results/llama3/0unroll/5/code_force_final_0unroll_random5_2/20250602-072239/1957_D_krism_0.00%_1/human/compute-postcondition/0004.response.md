The code prints the list `arr` which contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, and the list `prefix` which contains `n+1` integers where each element is the XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that index.
Output: **[list of n integers between 1 and 10^9], [list of n+1 integers where each element is the XOR of all elements in arr up to that index]**
