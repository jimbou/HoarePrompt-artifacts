This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It then unpacks the first integer from list 'a' into variable 'x' and the second integer from list 'a' into variable 'y'. Similarly, it unpacks the first string from list 'b' into variable 'dx' and the second string from list 'b' into variable 'dy'. The function then returns two values: the sum of 'x' and 'dx', and the sum of 'y' and 'dy'.
