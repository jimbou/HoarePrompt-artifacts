The program is correct. It accurately simulates the game of Quidditch as described in the problem statement. The program correctly handles player movements, catching and throwing the Quaffle, scoring goals, and eliminating players who come into contact with the Bludger. The program also correctly updates the score and prints the final score at the end of the game.

The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the players' positions, which allows for efficient lookups and updates. The program also uses a dictionary to keep track of the goals, which allows for efficient checking of whether a player has scored a goal.

The program's use of lists to represent the Quaffle's position and the players' positions is also correct. The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it, and correctly updates the players' positions when they move.

The program's handling of the Bludger is also correct. The program correctly checks whether a player has come into contact with the Bludger, and correctly eliminates the player if they have.
