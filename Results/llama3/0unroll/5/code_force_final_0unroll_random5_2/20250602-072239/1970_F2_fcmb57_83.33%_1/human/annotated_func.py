#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings.
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns two values: the sum of the first integer in list 'a' and the first string in list 'b', and the sum of the second integer in list 'a' and the second string in list 'b'. The first integer in list 'a' is x, the second integer in list 'a' is y, the first string in list 'b' is dx, and the second string in list 'b' is dy.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It then unpacks the first integer from list 'a' into variable 'x' and the second integer from list 'a' into variable 'y'. Similarly, it unpacks the first string from list 'b' into variable 'dx' and the second string from list 'b' into variable 'dy'. The function then returns two values: the sum of 'x' and 'dx', and the sum of 'y' and 'dy'.
