Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `loop` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now has n-1 lines instead of n, since the first line (containing the integer n) has been consumed by the input statement. The rest of the test case lines still contain two integers a and x with the same constraints as before.
