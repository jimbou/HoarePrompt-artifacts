Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The issue lies in the way it handles the constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to some integer x). The program only checks if the first integer i in the range from max(big) to min(less) is not in the list no, and if it is not, it assigns this value to num and breaks the loop. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider all possible integers in the range that satisfy the constraints.

For example, consider the input:

3
1 5
2 10
3 7

The program will output 5, but the correct output should be 4, because the possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10.

To fix this issue, the program should count the number of integers in the range from max(big) to min(less) that are not in the list no. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(big), min(less) + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)
```

This corrected program will output the correct number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints.
