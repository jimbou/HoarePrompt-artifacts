Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then determines the smallest number k that satisfies the constraints provided by the input, where k must be greater than or equal to x if a=1, less than or equal to x if a=2, and not equal to x if a=3. The function prints the smallest such k for each test case.**
