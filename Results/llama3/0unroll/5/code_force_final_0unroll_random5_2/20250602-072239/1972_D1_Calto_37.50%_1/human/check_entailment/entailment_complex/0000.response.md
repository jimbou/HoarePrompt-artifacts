Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

Function 1 correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

Function 2 attempts to calculate the sum of integer divisions of `n - (i * i - i)` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i` is greater than 1. However, this function has several issues:

1.  The loop only iterates up to `m-1`, but the problem statement requires considering all `b` up to `m`.
2.  The calculation `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly implement the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)`.
3.  The addition of `(i > 1)` to `cnt` is not justified by the problem statement.

Due to these issues, Function 2 does not correctly calculate the desired sum, and the overall program does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
