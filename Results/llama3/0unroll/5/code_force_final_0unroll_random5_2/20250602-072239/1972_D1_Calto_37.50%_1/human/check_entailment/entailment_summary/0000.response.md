Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, which is necessary for the problem. However, it modifies the input values in the process, which might not be desirable.

Function 2 calculates the sum of integer divisions of `n - (i * i - i)` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i` is greater than 1. It returns 1 if the sum is 0. This function seems to be related to the problem, but it's not immediately clear how it solves the problem.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that Function 2 is actually calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions. The loop iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m-1`, and for each `i`, it calculates the number of possible values of `a` that satisfy the conditions. The `x // y` expression calculates the number of multiples of `i * i` that are less than or equal to `n - (i * i - i)`, which corresponds to the number of possible values of `a`. The `(i > 1)` expression adds 1 to the count if `i` is greater than 1, which corresponds to the case where `a` is equal to `n`.

However, there is a subtle issue with Function 2. The loop only iterates up to `m-1`, but the problem statement requires `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. This means that the function is missing the case where `b` is equal to `m`. To fix this, the loop should iterate up to `m`, not `m-1`.

Despite this issue, the overall logic of Function 2 is correct, and it correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

Correctness: **False** (due to the off-by-one error in the loop)
