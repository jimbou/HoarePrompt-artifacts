Output State: **The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of `n - (i * i - i)` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i` is greater than 1, where `m` is 1 and `cnt` is not equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` is returned, which is the sum of the integer divisions of `n - (i * i - i)` by `i * i` for all `i` from 1 to `m-1`, plus the number of iterations where `i` is greater than 1. Since `m` is 1, the range of `i` is from 1 to 0, which means there are no iterations where `i` is greater than 1. Therefore, the returned value is simply the sum of the integer divisions of `n - (i * i - i)` by `i * i` for `i` equal to 1.
