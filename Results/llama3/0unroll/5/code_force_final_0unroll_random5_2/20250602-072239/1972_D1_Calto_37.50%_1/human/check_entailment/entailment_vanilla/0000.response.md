Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

`func_2` calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given n and m. It iterates over all possible values of i from 1 to m-1 and calculates the values of x and y. It then increments the count by the integer division of x by y plus 1 if i is greater than 1. If the count is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program does not use the `func_1` function anywhere. It seems that the `func_1` function was intended to calculate the gcd of a and b, but it is not used in the program.
2. The program does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs. The condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) is not properly checked in the program.
3. The program does not handle the case where n or m is 1 correctly. In this case, the program should return 1, but it does not.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
