Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the function `func_2(n, m)`. The loop only iterates until `m-1`, but it should iterate until `m`. This is because the problem statement requires `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and the current implementation excludes `b = m`.

For example, when `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the correct output should be 14, but the program outputs 13 because it misses the case where `b = 8`.
