Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were before the code was executed. The code only introduces a new variable `cnt` and assigns it the value 0. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, as well as the newly introduced variable `cnt` with a value of 0.
