Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the Quidditch game, including player movements, catching and throwing the Quaffle, and scoring goals. The program also correctly handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding a point to the opposing team. The output is also correctly formatted, with the final score printed at the end.

However, there are a few minor issues with the program. The function `func_1` is not necessary and can be replaced with a simple tuple addition. The variable `pointsb` and `pointsr` can be initialized to 0 in the same line. The `mouvements` dictionary can be defined as a constant.

Correctness: **True**
