Output State: **a and b are non-negative integers such that 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and a and b are odd, x is equal to a, y is equal to a, dx is equal to b, and dy is equal to b.**

The code assigns the value of `a` to both `x` and `y`, and the value of `b` to both `dx` and `dy`. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers within the specified range and are odd, the new variables `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` will also be non-negative integers within the same range and will be odd. The original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
