The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `t` is an integer larger than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one integer. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 3*10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**
