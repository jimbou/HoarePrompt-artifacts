#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        input_string = input()
        
        arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
        
        z = arr.count(0)
        
        o = arr.count(1)
        
        z_r = z

        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
            b_d = dist
        else:
            b_d = 30001
        
        for i in arr:

            if i == 0:

                2 - pos):

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string a of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It then calculates the number of 0s and 1s in the string, and iterates through the string to find the position where the number of 1s on the right is greater than or equal to half of the remaining elements, and the number of 0s on the left is greater than or equal to half of the elements on the left. The function prints the position where this condition is met, or 0 if no such position exists. The function repeats this process for all test cases until there are no more inputs.
