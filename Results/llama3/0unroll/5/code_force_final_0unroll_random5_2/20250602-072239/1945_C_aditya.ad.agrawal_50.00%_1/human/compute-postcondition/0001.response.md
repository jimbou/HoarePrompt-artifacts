Output State: **t is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is 0. This means that the loop has finished executing all the test cases provided in the input, and the program has printed the result for each test case. The values of other variables in the precondition, such as the input string and the array `arr`, remain unchanged.
