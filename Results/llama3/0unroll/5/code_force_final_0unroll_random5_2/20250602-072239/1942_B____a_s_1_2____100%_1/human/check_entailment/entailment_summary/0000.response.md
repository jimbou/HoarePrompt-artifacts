Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the array `n` for each test case.
2. It initializes an array `p` of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`. This array will store the permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.
3. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`). For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` of the permutation `p` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the prefix of `p` up to index `i`.
4. The program updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the prefix of `p` up to the current index.
5. Finally, the program prints the permutation `p` in the specified format.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program, and the program's logic is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
