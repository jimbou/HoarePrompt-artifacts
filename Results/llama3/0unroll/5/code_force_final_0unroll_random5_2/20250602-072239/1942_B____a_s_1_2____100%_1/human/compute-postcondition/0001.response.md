Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers representing the values of `p` for each test case, where `p` is an array of length `n` containing the minimum value of `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` in the array `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
