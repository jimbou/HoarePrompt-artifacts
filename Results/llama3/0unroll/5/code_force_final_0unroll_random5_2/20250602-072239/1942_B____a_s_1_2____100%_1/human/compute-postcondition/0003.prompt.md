You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases), then for each test case, first an integer (the length of the array), then a list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the array is between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and the sum of the lengths of all arrays does not exceed 200,000. The array elements are between -n and n (inclusive), where n is the length of the array.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum value of the array elements that are greater than or equal to the current index. The list is printed in reverse order, with the first element being the minimum value of the array elements that are greater than or equal to the last index, and the last element being the minimum value of the array elements that are greater than or equal to the first index.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
