Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum value of the array elements that are greater than or equal to the current index. The list is printed in reverse order, with the first element being the minimum value of the array elements that are greater than or equal to the last index, and the last element being the minimum value of the array elements that are greater than or equal to the first index.
