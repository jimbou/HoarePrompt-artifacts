Precondition: **stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases), then for each test case, first an integer (the length of the array), then a list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the array is between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and the sum of the lengths of all arrays does not exceed 200,000. The array elements are between -n and n (inclusive), where n is the length of the array.**
