Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array.

2. The program initializes an array `p` of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`. This array will store the permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

3. The program initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` so far.

4. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` of the permutation `p` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`. This formula is based on the definition of the array `a`, which states that `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.

5. After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` so far.

6. Finally, the program prints the permutation `p` in reverse order, which is the required output.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
