Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses the concept of the Minimum Excluded Value (MEX) to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an array `p` of size `n` with all elements set to `-1`. This array will store the constructed permutation.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which will keep track of the current MEX value.
5. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
6. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` in the permutation using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
7. It then updates the `mex` value to be the minimum of the current `mex` value and the newly calculated `p[i]` value.
8. After iterating over the entire array `a`, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct because it uses the definition of the MEX value to construct the permutation. By iterating over the array `a` in reverse order, it ensures that the MEX value is updated correctly at each step.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the line `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, the program assumes that `mex - a[i]` will always be a valid index for the array `p`. However, this assumption is not always true.

Consider the case where `a[i]` is equal to `mex`. In this case, `mex - a[i]` would be `0`, which is a valid index for the array `p`. However, if `a[i]` is greater than `mex`, then `mex - a[i]` would be negative, which is not a valid index for the array `p`.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that `mex - a[i]` is a valid index for the array `p` before assigning it to `p[i]`. If it's not a valid index, the program should handle this case accordingly.

Correctness: **False**
