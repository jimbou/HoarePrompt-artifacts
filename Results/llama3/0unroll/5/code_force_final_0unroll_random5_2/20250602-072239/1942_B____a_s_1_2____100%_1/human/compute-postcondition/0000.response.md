Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer (the length of the array), then a list of integers (the elements of the array). The length of the array is between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and the sum of the lengths of all arrays does not exceed 200,000. The array elements are between -n and n (inclusive), where n is the length of the array.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is the number of test cases, which is an integer. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case, but the first input (the number of test cases) has been consumed and assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs in stdin are the same as before, with each test case consisting of an integer (the length of the array) followed by a list of integers (the elements of the array). The constraints on the length of the array and the range of the array elements remain the same.
