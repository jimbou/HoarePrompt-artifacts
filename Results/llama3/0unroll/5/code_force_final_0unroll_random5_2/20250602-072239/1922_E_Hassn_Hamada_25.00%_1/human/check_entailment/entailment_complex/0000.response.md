Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number, as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is recursive and generates a sequence of integers from 0 to size - 1, where size is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 > number. It then appends these integers to the input sequence list and uses the result to increment certain elements in the sequence list.

The program handles the base case where the input number is 0 correctly, returning 0 without modifying the input variables. It also correctly calculates the size of the generated sequence and returns it along with the modified sequence.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
