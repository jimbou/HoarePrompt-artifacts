Output State: **The function returns the size of the generated sequence, but the code does not modify the input variables `number` and `sequence`.**

In this case, the code does not have any impact on the program state because it is just a docstring that describes the function's purpose, arguments, and return value. It does not contain any executable code. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the function returns the size of the generated sequence.
