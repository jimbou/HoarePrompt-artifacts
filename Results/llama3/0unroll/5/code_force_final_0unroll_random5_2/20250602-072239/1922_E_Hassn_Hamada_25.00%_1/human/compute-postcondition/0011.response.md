Output State: **The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, and `sequence` is a list of integers from 0 to `size - 1`, where each element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result` for `i` ranging from 0 to `size - 1`.**
