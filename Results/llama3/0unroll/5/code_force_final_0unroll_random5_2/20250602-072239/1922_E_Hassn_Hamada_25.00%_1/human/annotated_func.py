    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence

        #The program returns 0, which is the size of the generated sequence, without modifying the input variables `number` and `sequence`, where `number` is currently 0.
    #State: The function returns the size of the generated sequence, the input variables `number` and `sequence` are not modified, and `number` is not equal to 0.

    #State: Output State: `result` is returned with the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, sequence is a list of integers from 0 to size - 1, where each element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result` for `i` ranging from 0 to size - 1.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, and `sequence` is a list of integers from 0 to `size - 1`, where each element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result` for `i` ranging from 0 to `size - 1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence list. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0 without modifying the input variables. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of integers from 0 to size - 1, where size is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 > number, and appends these integers to the input sequence list. The function then calls another function `func_1` with the modified input number and sequence, and uses the result to increment certain elements in the sequence list. Finally, the function returns the sum of the size and the result from `func_1`.
