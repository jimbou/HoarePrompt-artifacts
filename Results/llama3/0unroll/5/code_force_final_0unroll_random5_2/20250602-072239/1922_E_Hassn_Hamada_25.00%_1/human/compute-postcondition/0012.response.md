Functionality: **Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence list. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0 without modifying the input variables. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of integers from 0 to size - 1, where size is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 > number, and appends these integers to the input sequence list. The function then calls another function `func_1` with the modified input number and sequence, and uses the result to increment certain elements in the sequence list. Finally, the function returns the sum of the size and the result from `func_1`.**
