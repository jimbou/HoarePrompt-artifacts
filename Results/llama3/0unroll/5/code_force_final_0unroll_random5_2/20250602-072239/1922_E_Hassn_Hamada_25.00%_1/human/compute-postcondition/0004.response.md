Output State: **The function returns the size of the generated sequence, the input variables `number` and `sequence` are not modified, `number` is not equal to 0, and `size` is 1.**

In this output state, the function still returns the size of the generated sequence, and the input variables `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged. Additionally, `number` is still not equal to 0. The only change is that the variable `size` has been assigned the value 1.
