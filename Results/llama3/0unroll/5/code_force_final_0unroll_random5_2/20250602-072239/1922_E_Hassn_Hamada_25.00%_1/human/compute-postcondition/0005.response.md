Output State: **size is the smallest integer such that (1 << size) - 1 > number.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `size` is incremented until the value of `(1 << size) - 1` exceeds the value of `number`. This means that `size` will be the smallest integer that satisfies the condition `(1 << size) - 1 > number`.
