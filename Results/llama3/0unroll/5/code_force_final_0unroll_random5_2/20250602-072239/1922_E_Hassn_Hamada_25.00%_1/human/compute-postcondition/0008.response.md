Output State: **`result` is returned with the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, sequence is a list of integers from 0 to size - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `result` is determined by the function `func_1`, which takes two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The value of `sequence` remains unchanged, as it is a list of integers from 0 to size - 1. The function `func_1` is called with the specified arguments, and its return value is assigned to `result`.
