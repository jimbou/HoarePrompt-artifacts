The function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing 'W' and 'B' characters. The function finds the indices of the first and last 'B' characters in the string s and prints the length of the string minus the sum of these indices. The function repeats this process for all t test cases.
