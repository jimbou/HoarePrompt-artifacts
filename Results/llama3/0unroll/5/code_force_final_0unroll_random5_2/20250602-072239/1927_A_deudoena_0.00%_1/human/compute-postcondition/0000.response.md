Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. inpstr is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0.**

The first line reads an integer t from stdin and assigns it to inpstr. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The next three lines initialize variables ind1, ind2, and outind to 0. These variables are new and do not affect any existing variables. The final state includes the updated stdin, the new variables, and their values.
