Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, which represents the sum of the array. However, this approach does not consider the splitting of the array into subarrays, which is a crucial part of the problem.

The program's output is simply the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not necessarily represent the minimum possible penalty. For example, in the third test case, the program outputs 0, but the correct answer is 0 because the array can be split into subarrays with a sum of 0.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not properly address the problem of splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **False**
