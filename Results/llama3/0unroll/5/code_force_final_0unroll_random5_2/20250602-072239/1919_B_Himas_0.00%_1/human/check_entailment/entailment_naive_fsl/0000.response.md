Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by simply calculating the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, resulting in two subarrays with sums equal to the number of '+' and '-' characters, respectively. The penalty of each subarray is then equal to its sum multiplied by its length, which is equal to the number of '+' or '-' characters. Therefore, the total penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the string contains only '+' characters, the penalty is equal to the length of the string.
* When the string contains only '-' characters, the penalty is equal to the length of the string.
* When the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, the penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the string is empty or contains only one character.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible cases.
