Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string, which represents the sum of the array. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible. This can be achieved by alternating between '+' and '-' characters in the string.

The given program does not consider this approach and simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
