Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and then printing the difference between the counts. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem requires splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays or calculate the penalties of the subarrays. It simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints the difference, which is not relevant to the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
