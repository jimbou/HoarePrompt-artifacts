Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by simply calculating the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to split it into subarrays of length 1, where each subarray contains either a '+' or a '-' character. The penalty for each subarray is then either 1 or -1, depending on the character. The total penalty is the sum of these penalties, which is equal to the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases, the length of the string, and the string itself, and printing the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
