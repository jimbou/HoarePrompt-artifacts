Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only checks for a specific condition where two adjacent elements in the list satisfy a certain relationship, and if this condition is met, it prints 2. If not, it prints 3. However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The program does not consider all possible cases and does not provide a correct solution for all inputs.

For example, consider the input [1, 3, 2, 4]. The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2, because Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 3, and both will come to the party.

Correctness: **False**
