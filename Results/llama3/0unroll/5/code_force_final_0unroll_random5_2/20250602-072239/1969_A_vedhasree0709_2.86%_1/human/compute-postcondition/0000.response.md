Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer is either 2 or 3. The length of the list will be equal to the value of t in the initial state. For each test case, if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in the list l such that the first element is equal to the index of the second element plus 2, and the second element is equal to the index of the first element plus 1, then the output will be 2. Otherwise, the output will be 3.**
