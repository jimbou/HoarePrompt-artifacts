Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one test case has been read.
