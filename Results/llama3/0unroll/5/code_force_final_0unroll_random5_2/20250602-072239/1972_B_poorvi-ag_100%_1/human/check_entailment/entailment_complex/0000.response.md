Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, determines whether the count of "U" in each string is odd or even, and outputs "yes" if it's odd and "no" if it's even.

The key insight here is that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win. The program uses the fact that if the count of "U" is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because Alice goes first, and she can always choose a coin that will leave an even number of "U" coins, forcing Bob to leave an odd number of "U" coins, and so on.

The program correctly implements this logic by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the count of "U" is odd or even. If the count is odd, it appends "yes" to the results list, and if it's even, it appends "no".

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads the positive integer `n` and the string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then determines the result for each test case and appends it to the results list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
