#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is a list of strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding test case is odd or even, stdin contains no test cases.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is as follows: the variable i has taken on the values of each string in the results list in each iteration, and the print function has printed each string in the results list to the console. The variable t and the stdin remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines whether the count of "U" in each string is odd or even and outputs "yes" if it's odd and "no" if it's even, printing the results for all test cases.
