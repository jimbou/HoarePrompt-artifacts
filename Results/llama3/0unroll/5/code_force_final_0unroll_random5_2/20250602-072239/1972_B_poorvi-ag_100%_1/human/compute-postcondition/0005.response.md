Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines whether the count of "U" in each string is odd or even and outputs "yes" if it's odd and "no" if it's even, printing the results for all test cases.**
