Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The problem description states that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win. However, the program does not take into account the number of operations or the game's ending condition. It simply checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even and prints 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

A counterexample is when the input is "UUUUUU". The program will print 'no', but in reality, Alice will win the game because she can remove all the 'U's in a finite number of operations.

The correct solution should simulate the game and check who wins, taking into account the number of operations and the game's ending condition.
