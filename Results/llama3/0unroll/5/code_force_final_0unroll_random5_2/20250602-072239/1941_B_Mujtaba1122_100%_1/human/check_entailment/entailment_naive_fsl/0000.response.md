Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 7, 2] and n is 4, the program will print 'NO' but it should print 'NO' because it is not possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the elements of the list can be made zero by repeatedly applying the operation to the middle elements, but it does not consider the case where the operation needs to be applied to the first or last elements.

For instance, in the case of the list [1, 2, 7, 2], the program will try to make the middle elements zero by repeatedly applying the operation, but it will not be able to make the first and last elements zero because the operation cannot be applied to them.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
