This function modifies a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer n, where n is the length of the list. It transforms the list such that all elements except the first and last are set to 0, and the first and last elements are set to the sum of all the original elements in the list. The function then checks the result of another function, func_1, with the modified list and n as inputs. If func_1 returns True, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The value of n remains unchanged throughout the process.
