Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 50), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= n <= 50) and then a binary string of size n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 50. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the input operation. Each remaining test case still contains two inputs: an integer between 1 and 50, and a binary string of size n.
