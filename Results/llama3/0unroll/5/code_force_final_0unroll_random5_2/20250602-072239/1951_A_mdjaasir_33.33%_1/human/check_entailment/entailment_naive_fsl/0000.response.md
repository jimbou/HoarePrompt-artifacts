Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the count of '1's is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, it is impossible to turn on a single lamp, but the program does not check for this case. It only checks for the cases when the count of '1's is 0, 2, or more than 2. 

For example, if the input is:

1
3
101

The program will print 'NO', but it should print 'NO' because it is impossible to turn on a single lamp.

The correct code should add an additional condition to check if the count of '1's is 1, and if so, print 'NO'.
