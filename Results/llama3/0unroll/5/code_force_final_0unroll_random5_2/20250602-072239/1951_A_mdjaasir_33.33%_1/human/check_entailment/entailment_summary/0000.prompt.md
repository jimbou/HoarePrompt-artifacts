Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
There are 𝑛 lamps numbered 1 to 𝑛 lined up in a row, initially turned off. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose two non-adjacent† lamps that are currently turned off, then turn them on. Determine whether you can reach configuration 𝑠, where 𝑠𝑖=1 means the 𝑖-th lamp is turned on, and 𝑠𝑖=0 otherwise. † Only lamp 𝑖 and 𝑖+1 are adjacent for all 1≤𝑖<𝑛. Note that lamp 𝑛 and 1 are not adjacent when 𝑛≠2. Input: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤50) — the number of lamps. The second line of each test case contains a binary string 𝑠 of size 𝑛 — the final desired configuration. Output: For each test case, print on one line "YES" if we can reach the configuration 𝑠 via applying the given operation any number of times. Otherwise, print "NO".

# Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        count = a.count('1')
        if count == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif count == 2:
            if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')





# Execution Summary:
This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer 'n' and a binary string 'a' of size 'n'. It then checks the number of '1's in the string 'a' and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if there are no '1's, if there are more than 2 '1's and the count is even, or if there are exactly 2 '1's and they are not consecutive. In all other cases, it prints 'NO'. The function processes 't' number of test cases, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 50, and does not modify any external variables.
