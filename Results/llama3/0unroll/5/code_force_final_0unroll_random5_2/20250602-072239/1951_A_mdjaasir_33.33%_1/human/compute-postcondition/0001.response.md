Output State: **The loop will execute 't' number of times, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 50. In each iteration, it will read an integer 'n' and a binary string 'a' of size 'n' from the standard input. It will then count the number of '1's in the string 'a' and store it in the variable 'count'. If 'count' is 0, it will print 'YES'. If 'count' is greater than 2 and even, it will print 'YES'. If 'count' is 2, it will check if the first '1' in the string 'a' is not followed by another '1', and if so, it will print 'YES', otherwise it will print 'NO'. In all other cases, it will print 'NO'. The loop will not modify the value of 't' or any other variables outside the loop.**
