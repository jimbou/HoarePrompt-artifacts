Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer 'n' and a binary string 'a' of size 'n'. It then checks the number of '1's in the string 'a' and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if there are no '1's, if there are more than 2 '1's and the count is even, or if there are exactly 2 '1's and they are not consecutive. In all other cases, it prints 'NO'. The function processes 't' number of test cases, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 50, and does not modify any external variables.**
