Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each corresponding to whether the test case was successful or not. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed will be equal to the number of test cases t. The values of t, n, k, healths, positions, monsters, total_bullets_used, and success will be updated after each iteration of the loop, but their final values will not be printed. The stdin will be empty after the loop finishes executing.**
