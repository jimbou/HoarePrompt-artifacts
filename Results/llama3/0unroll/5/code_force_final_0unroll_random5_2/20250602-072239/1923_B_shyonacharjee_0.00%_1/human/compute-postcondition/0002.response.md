Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of monsters with their health and position. It then determines whether it is possible to kill all monsters with a limited number of bullets, based on their distance and health. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible to kill all monsters and 'NO' otherwise, for each test case.**
