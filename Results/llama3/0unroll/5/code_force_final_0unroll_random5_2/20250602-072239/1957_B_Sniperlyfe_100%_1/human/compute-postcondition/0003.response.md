Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^9, nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k and the rest are 0, and the value of nums[i] for 1 <= i < n is min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k + 1, k) and k is reduced by the value of nums[i] in each iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of nums[0] is increased by k, and the rest of the values in the list remain the same. The value of k is not explicitly changed, but it is used in the calculation of nums[0]. The values of n and the rest of the list remain the same.
