#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^9, nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are 0, and the value of nums[i] for 1 <= i < n is min(nums[0] + 1, k) and k is reduced by the value of nums[i] in each iteration.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k, and the rest of the elements are the minimum of (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k + 1 and k, with k being reduced by the value of each element in each iteration.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function generates a list of n integers based on the input integer k. It first calculates the maximum possible value for the first element in the list, then iteratively calculates the values for the remaining elements, reducing k by the value of each element in each iteration. The function returns the list of calculated integers, where the first element is the maximum possible value plus the remaining value of k, and the rest of the elements are the minimum of the maximum possible value plus one and the remaining value of k.
