Output State: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^9, nums is a list of n integers where nums[0] is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are 0, and the value of nums[i] for 1 <= i < n is min(nums[0] + 1, k) and k is reduced by the value of nums[i] in each iteration.
