Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation and move according to certain rules. The goal is to determine who wins the game after a specified number of turns.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. It also reads the permutation and the array of scores.

The program then checks if the maximum score in the array is equal to the score at the starting position of either Bodya or Sasha. If it is, the program prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.

If the maximum score is not equal to the score at the starting position of either Bodya or Sasha, the program simulates the game for both players. It keeps track of the scores of both players at each turn and checks if the maximum score is reached. If it is, the program prints the winner of the game.

The program uses a list to keep track of the scores of both players at each turn. It also uses a list to keep track of the maximum scores that can be achieved by both players at each turn.

Finally, the program compares the maximum scores of both players and prints the winner of the game.

Correctness: **True**
