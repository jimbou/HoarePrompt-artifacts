Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to determine the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their scores and a set of rules. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four lines: the number of players, the number of rounds, and the initial scores of Bodya and Sasha. It then simulates the game, updating the scores according to the rules, and prints the winner of each test case: either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' if the scores are tied.

The program correctly handles the game logic, including the rules for updating scores and determining the winner. It also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the test cases from standard input and printing the results to standard output.

However, the program has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops used to simulate the game. This could potentially lead to performance issues for large inputs.

Correctness: **True**
