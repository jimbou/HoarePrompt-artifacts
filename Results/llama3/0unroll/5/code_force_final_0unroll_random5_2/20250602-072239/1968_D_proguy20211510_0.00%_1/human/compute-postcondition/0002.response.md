Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their scores and a set of rules. The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four lines: the number of players, the number of rounds, and the initial scores of Bodya and Sasha. It then simulates the game, updating the scores according to the rules, and prints the winner of each test case: either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' if the scores are tied.**
