Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the problem description. 

The program first checks if the maximum score is achieved by both players at their starting positions. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case. 

If not, it simulates the game for both players, keeping track of their scores and positions. It uses two lists, `b` and `s`, to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha at each turn. 

The program then calculates the prefix sums of these lists and stores them in `preb` and `pres`. 

Next, it calculates the total score for each player at each turn by adding the prefix sum and the remaining turns multiplied by the score at that turn. These total scores are stored in `ptsb` and `ptss`. 

Finally, it compares the maximum total scores of both players and prints the winner accordingly. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, and its logic is sound. 

Correctness: **True**
