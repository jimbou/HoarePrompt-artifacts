Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the scores. The program first checks if the maximum score is achieved by both players at the same position, in which case it's a draw. Then it checks if the maximum score is achieved by either player at their starting position, in which case that player wins. If neither of these conditions is met, the program simulates the game for k rounds, updating the scores according to the rules, and then determines the winner based on the maximum score achieved by each player.

The program uses a list to store the scores of each player at each round, and then uses another list to store the maximum score that can be achieved by each player at each round. It then compares these maximum scores to determine the winner.

The program handles the case where the number of rounds k is greater than the length of the permutation p, by appending the maximum score to the list of scores for the remaining rounds.

The program also handles the case where the maximum score is achieved by both players at different positions, in which case it's a draw.

Overall, the program correctly implements the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the scores.

Correctness: **True**
