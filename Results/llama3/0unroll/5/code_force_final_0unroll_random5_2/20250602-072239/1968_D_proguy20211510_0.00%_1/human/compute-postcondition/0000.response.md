Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, k, P_B, P_S (1 <= n, k, P_B, P_S <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n). The third line contains n space-separated integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
