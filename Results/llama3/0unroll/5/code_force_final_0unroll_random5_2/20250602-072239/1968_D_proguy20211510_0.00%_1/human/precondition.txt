The input contains an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, k, P_B, P_S, followed by two lists of n integers p and a. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, and p and a are lists of integers such that 1 <= p_i, a_i <= n for all i.
