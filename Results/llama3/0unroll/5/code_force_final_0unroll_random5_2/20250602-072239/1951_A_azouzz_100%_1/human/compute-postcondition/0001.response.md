Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will print 'YES' or 'NO' to the console based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The value of t will remain unchanged, and the stdin will be empty after all test cases have been processed. The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each test case, indicating whether the binary string meets the specified conditions.**
