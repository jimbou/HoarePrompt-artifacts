Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string of the same length. It then checks the binary string against certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console for each test case, indicating whether the string meets the conditions. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input, leaving behind a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs.**
