The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (between 1 and 1000) and then a binary string of the same length as the integer. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer.**
