Reasoning:
The provided Python program is correct based on the given problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t` and the length of the string `n`, as well as the encoded string `b`.
2.  The `func_1` function takes the encoded string `b` as input and correctly calculates the unique characters in the string, sorts them in alphabetical order, and creates a character mapping `char_map` to replace each character with its symmetric character.
3.  The function then uses this character mapping to decode the input string `b` and returns the decoded string.
4.  The program iterates over the test cases, applies the `func_1` function to each encoded string, and stores the results in the `results` list.
5.  Finally, the program prints each decoded string in the `results` list.

The execution summary confirms that the function works as expected, reversing the order of unique characters in the string while maintaining their original frequency.

Correctness: **True**
