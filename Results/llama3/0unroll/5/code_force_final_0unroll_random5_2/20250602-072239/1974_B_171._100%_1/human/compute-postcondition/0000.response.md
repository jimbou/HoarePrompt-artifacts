Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a list of unique characters from encoded in sorted order, char_map is an empty dictionary, len_unique is the number of unique characters in encoded.**

The code snippet first creates a set of unique characters from the string `encoded`, which removes any duplicate characters. It then sorts this set in ascending order and assigns it to the variable `unique_chars`. The length of this list is calculated and assigned to the variable `len_unique`. Finally, an empty dictionary `char_map` is created, but no values are assigned to it. The original string `encoded` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
