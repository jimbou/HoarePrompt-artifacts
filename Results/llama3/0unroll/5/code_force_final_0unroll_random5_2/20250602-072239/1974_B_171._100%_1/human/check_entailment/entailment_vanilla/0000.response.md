Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (t) and the length of the encoded string (n) for each test case.
2. For each test case, the program reads the encoded string (b) and passes it to the `func_1` function for decoding.
3. The `func_1` function first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order. This set represents the auxiliary string (r) used in the encoding algorithm.
4. The function then creates a dictionary (char_map) that maps each character in the auxiliary string to its symmetric character. This is done by iterating over the sorted unique characters and mapping each character to the character at the corresponding index from the end of the list.
5. The function then uses the char_map dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string.
6. The decoded string is then returned by the `func_1` function and appended to the results list.
7. Finally, the program prints each decoded string in the results list.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
