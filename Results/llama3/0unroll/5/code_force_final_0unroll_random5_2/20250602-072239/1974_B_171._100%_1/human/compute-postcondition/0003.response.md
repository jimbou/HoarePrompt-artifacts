Output State: **`decoded` is a string where each character is the corresponding decoded character from the `char_map` dictionary, `char_map` dictionary is populated with key-value pairs where each key is a unique character from the encoded string and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored position in the sorted list of unique characters, `encoded` is a string.**

In this output state, the `decoded` variable is assigned a string value that is created by replacing each character in the `encoded` string with its corresponding decoded character from the `char_map` dictionary. The `char_map` dictionary remains populated with the same key-value pairs as before, where each key is a unique character from the `encoded` string and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored position in the sorted list of unique characters. The `encoded` string also remains unchanged.
