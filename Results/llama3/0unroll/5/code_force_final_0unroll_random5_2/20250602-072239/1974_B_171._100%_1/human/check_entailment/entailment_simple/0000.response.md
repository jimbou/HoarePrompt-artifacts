Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first constructs a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`. This is done using the `sorted(set(b))` expression, which removes duplicates and sorts the characters in alphabetical order.

2. The program then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character to its mirrored position in the sorted list. This is done using the loop that iterates over the indices of the unique characters and assigns the character at the mirrored position as the value in the dictionary.

3. Finally, the program decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character from the `char_map` dictionary. This is done using the `join` method that concatenates the decoded characters into a single string.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. It correctly constructs the sorted list of unique characters, creates the mapping of characters to their mirrored positions, and decodes the string using this mapping.

Correctness: **True**
