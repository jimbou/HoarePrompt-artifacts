Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` itself.

2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `b` as input.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program creates a set of unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order. This gives the auxiliary string `r` mentioned in the problem statement.

4. The program then creates a character mapping `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`).

5. The program uses this character mapping to decode the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its symmetric character from `r`.

6. Finally, the program returns the decoded string.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order
* Strings of varying lengths

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* An empty string (although this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement, the program would correctly return an empty string)
* A string with only one unique character (the program would correctly return the same string)

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
