#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: The char_map dictionary is populated with key-value pairs where each key is a unique character from the encoded string and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored position in the sorted list of unique characters.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the decoded string where each character is the corresponding decoded character from the char_map dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a string of lowercase Latin letters, reverses the order of unique characters in the string while maintaining their original frequency, and returns the resulting decoded string.
