Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to decode a string that was previously encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a new auxiliary string, which consists of all distinct letters of the original string in alphabetical order.

The program works as follows:

1. It first reads the input data, including the number of test cases and the encoded strings.
2. For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string and the string itself.
3. It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string.
4. The function `func_1` works as follows:
   - It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each key is a unique character from the encoded string and its corresponding value is the character at the mirrored position in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - It then uses this dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character.
   - Finally, it returns the decoded string.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm. It correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string, creates the `char_map` dictionary, and uses it to decode the string.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
