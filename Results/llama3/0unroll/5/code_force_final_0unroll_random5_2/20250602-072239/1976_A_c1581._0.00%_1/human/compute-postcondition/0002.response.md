Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, `digits` is a list of all the digits in the password string, `letters` is a list of all the letters in the password string, `last_digit_index` is -1**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `last_digit_index` and assigned it the value -1. The values of the other variables, `password`, `digits`, and `letters`, remain unchanged. The password string still consists of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The lists `digits` and `letters` still contain all the digits and letters in the password string, respectively.
