Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to verify if a given password is strong based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program correctly checks for the following conditions:

1.  The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2.  There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3.  All digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.
4.  All letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.

The program correctly implements these conditions by:

*   Separating the password into digits and letters.
*   Checking if there is a digit after a letter by iterating through the password and maintaining the index of the last digit encountered.
*   Verifying if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing them with their sorted versions.

If any of these conditions are not met, the program correctly returns 'NO'. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
