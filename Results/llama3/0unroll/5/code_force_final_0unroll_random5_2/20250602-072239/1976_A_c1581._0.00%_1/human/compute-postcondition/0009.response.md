Output State: **The program returns the string 'NO'. The values of `last_digit_index`, `password`, `digits`, and `letters` remain unchanged. Specifically, `last_digit_index` still holds the index of the last digit in the password string, `password` remains in its original state, `digits` is still sorted, and `letters` is still unsorted and not equal to its sorted version.**
