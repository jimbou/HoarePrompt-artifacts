#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string.

    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):

        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the password string, `password` is unchanged, `digits` is unchanged, `letters` is unchanged.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'. The state of the variables 'password', 'digits', and 'letters' remains unchanged. The variable 'last_digit_index' still holds the index of the last digit in the password string. The list 'digits' is still not in sorted order.
    #State: *`last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the password string, `password` is unchanged, `digits` is unchanged, `letters` is unchanged, and `digits` is sorted
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns the string 'NO'. The values of `last_digit_index`, `password`, `digits`, and `letters` remain unchanged. Specifically, `last_digit_index` still holds the index of the last digit in the password string, `password` remains in its original state, `digits` is still sorted, and `letters` is still unsorted and not equal to its sorted version.
    #State: *`last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the password string, `password` is unchanged, `digits` is unchanged, `letters` is unchanged, `digits` is sorted, and `letters` is sorted
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns the string 'YES'

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if a given password string meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' if it does, or 'NO' otherwise. The conditions are: (1) the password string must not contain any digits that are not in the correct order from left to right, (2) the digits in the password string must be in sorted order, and (3) the letters in the password string must be in sorted order. The function does not modify the input password string.
