Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to verify if a given password meets certain conditions. The conditions are: (1) the password string must not contain any digits that are not in the correct order from left to right, (2) the digits in the password string must be in sorted order, and (3) the letters in the password string must be in sorted order.

The program correctly implements these conditions by first separating the digits and letters in the password string. It then checks if there are any digits that come after a letter, which would violate condition (1). If such a digit is found, the function immediately returns 'NO'.

Next, the program checks if the digits and letters are in sorted order by comparing them to their sorted versions. If either the digits or letters are not in sorted order, the function returns 'NO'.

If the password string passes all these checks, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
