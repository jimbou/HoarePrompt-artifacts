Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided Python program is designed to verify the strength of a password based on the given conditions. It checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if there are no digits after letters, if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, and if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program correctly implements these conditions by separating the password into digits and letters, checking if the digits are sorted, and verifying that there are no digits after letters. It also checks if the letters are sorted.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords that do not meet the conditions. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
