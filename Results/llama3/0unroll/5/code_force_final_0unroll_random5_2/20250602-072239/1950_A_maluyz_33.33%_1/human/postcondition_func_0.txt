This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer t, followed by t lines each containing three digits a, b, and c. It then analyzes each set of three digits and prints one of three possible strings: 'STAIR' if the digits are in ascending order, 'PEAK' if the middle digit is the largest, or 'NONE' in all other cases. The function outputs t lines, each containing one of these strings, depending on the input values.
