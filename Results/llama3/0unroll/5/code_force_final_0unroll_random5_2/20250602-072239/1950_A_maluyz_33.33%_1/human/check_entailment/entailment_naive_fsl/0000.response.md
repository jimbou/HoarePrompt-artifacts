Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a < b > c and a is not equal to c. In this case, the program should print "PEAK", but it prints "NONE" instead.

For example, if the input is "1 5 3", the program should print "PEAK", but it prints "NONE".

The correct condition for "PEAK" should be "a < b and b > c", not "max(a, b, c) == b".
