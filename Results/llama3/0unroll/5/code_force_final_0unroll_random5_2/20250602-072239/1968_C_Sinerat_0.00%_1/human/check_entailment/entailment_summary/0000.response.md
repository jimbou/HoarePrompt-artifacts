Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find any array a_1, ..., a_n that satisfies the given conditions. The program initializes the first element of the array a to 500, which is within the allowed range of 1 to 10^9. Then, for each subsequent element, it calculates the value as the sum of the previous element and the corresponding input number x_i. This ensures that the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} is satisfied for all 2 <= i <= n.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, the number of elements in each test case, and the input numbers for each test case. It then prints the generated array for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
