Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`.
* The program initializes an array `a` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
* The program sets `a[0]` to 500, which is a valid choice since `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`.
* The program then iterates from `i=1` to `n-1` and sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`, since `a_i` is the sum of `a_{i-1}` and `x_i`.
* Finally, the program prints the array `a`, which satisfies the conditions of the problem.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required conditions. The example output provided in the problem statement matches the output produced by the program, which further confirms its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
