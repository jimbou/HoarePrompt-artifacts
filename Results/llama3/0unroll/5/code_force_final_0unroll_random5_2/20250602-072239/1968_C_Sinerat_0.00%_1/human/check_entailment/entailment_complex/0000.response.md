Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

2. The program initializes an array `a` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. It then sets `a[0]` to 500, which is a valid choice for `a_1` since `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.

3. The program then iterates over the range `1` to `n` (inclusive) and sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`, since `a_i` is chosen to be the smallest possible value that satisfies this condition.

4. Finally, the program prints the generated sequence `a`.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces a valid sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
