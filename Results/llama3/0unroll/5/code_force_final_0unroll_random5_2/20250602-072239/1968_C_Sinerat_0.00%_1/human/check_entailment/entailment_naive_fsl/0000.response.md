Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find an array `a_1, ..., a_n` that satisfies the given conditions. The key insight is that `a_i` can be chosen as `a_{i-1} + x_i` for `i >= 2`, which ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`. The program initializes `a_0` to 500, which is a valid choice since `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `i`. Then, it iterates through the input array `x` and computes `a_i` as `a_{i-1} + x_i` for each `i`. Finally, it prints the computed array `a`.

The program works correctly for all possible inputs because it correctly implements the mathematical logic behind the problem. The choice of `a_0 = 500` is arbitrary, but it satisfies the condition `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. The subsequent computation of `a_i` ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `i >= 2`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
