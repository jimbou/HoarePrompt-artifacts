This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n-1 integers. It then generates a sequence of numbers, starting with 500, where each subsequent number is the sum of the previous number and the corresponding input number. The function prints each generated sequence.
