Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`, where `x_i` is the given array and `a_i` is the array to be found. The constraints are `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for all `1 <= i <= n`.

The given program initializes the first element of the array `a` to 500, which is within the allowed range. Then, for each subsequent element `a_i`, it calculates `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` because `a_i` is the sum of `a_{i-1}` and `x_{i-1}`, and the remainder of `a_i` divided by `a_{i-1}` is `x_{i-1}`.

The program correctly satisfies the conditions of the problem, and the calculated array `a` is within the allowed range.

Correctness: **True**
