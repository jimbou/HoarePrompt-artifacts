Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road and checks if the condition is satisfied. The program also handles edge cases where the road is laid before the first house or after the last house.

The program uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to move towards the middle of the village from both ends. It checks if the condition is satisfied at each position and updates the pointers accordingly. The program also keeps track of the total number of zeros and ones on both sides of the road.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It handles all possible cases, including edge cases, and provides the correct output.

One potential case that could be considered is when the input string `s` contains only zeros or only ones. In this case, the program correctly outputs 0, which is the correct answer according to the problem description.

Overall, based on the provided code and problem description, the program appears to be correct, and I couldn't find any potential case where it doesn't work as expected.
