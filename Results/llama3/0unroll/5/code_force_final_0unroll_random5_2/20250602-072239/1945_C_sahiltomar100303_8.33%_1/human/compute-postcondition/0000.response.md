The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 3*10^5). The second line contains a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1. Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the input, `t` is now equal to the number of test cases. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 3*10^5). The second line contains a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 3*10^5). The second line contains a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.**
