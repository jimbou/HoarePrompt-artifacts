This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string a of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make the string a palindrome for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, counting the occurrences of 0s and 1s in the left and right halves of the string, and adjusts the boundaries of these halves to find the minimum number of operations required to make the string a palindrome. The function handles various cases, including when the left or right half is empty, and prints the minimum number of operations required for each test case.
