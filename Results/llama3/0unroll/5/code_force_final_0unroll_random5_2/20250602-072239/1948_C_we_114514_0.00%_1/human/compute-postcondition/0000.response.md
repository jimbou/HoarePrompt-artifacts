Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The `test_cases` list also remains unchanged, containing tuples with a positive even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `results`, which is initialized as an empty list.
