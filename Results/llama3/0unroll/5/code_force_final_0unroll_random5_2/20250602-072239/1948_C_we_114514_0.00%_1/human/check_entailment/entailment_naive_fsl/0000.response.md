Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the robot's movement according to the problem description. The robot's movement is not correctly simulated, and the program does not correctly check if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES". The robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks if the robot can reach the last column from the first row or the second row, but it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement. The program does not take into account the robot's ability to move up or down, and it does not correctly handle the case where the robot moves from one row to the other.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
