    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO'.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', representing the results of processing a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It determines whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string from the first string by moving right, and returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', representing the results of processing each test case. The function does not modify the input variables.
