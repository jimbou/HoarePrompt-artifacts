Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) and a string (s) of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It then calculates the minimum number of positions to move the left and right pointers to make the left half of the string have at least (n+1)//2 zeros and the right half have at least (n+1)//2 ones, or prints -1 if it's impossible. The function prints the result for each test case and continues until all test cases have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.**
