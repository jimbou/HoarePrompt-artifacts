The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs, the first input (an integer greater than or equal to 3) is assigned to `t`. The second input (a string consisting only of 0 and 1) is still in the stdin. The length of the string is equal to the integer assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string consisting only of 0 and 1, with a length equal to `t`.**
