Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program iterates over each test case, where `n` and `k` are the input values.

If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, it prints a sequence of `k` repeated `k` times, which satisfies the condition of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. If `n` is greater than `k`, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array.

If `k` is 1, the program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition of having exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. When `k` is greater than 1, the only possible solution is when `n` is equal to `k`, and the program correctly handles this case. When `k` is 1, the program correctly prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

Correctness: **True**
