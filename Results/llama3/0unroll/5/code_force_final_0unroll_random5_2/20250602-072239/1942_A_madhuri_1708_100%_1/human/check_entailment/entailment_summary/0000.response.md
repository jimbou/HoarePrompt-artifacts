Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program correctly handles the case when `k` is 1. In this case, it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted.
*   When `k` is greater than 1, the program checks if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it prints a sequence of `k` repeated `k` times. This is a valid solution because all `k` cyclic shifts of this sequence are sorted.
*   If `n` is greater than `k` and `k` is greater than 1, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid solution. This is correct because it is impossible to construct an array of length `n` with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is greater than `k`.

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
