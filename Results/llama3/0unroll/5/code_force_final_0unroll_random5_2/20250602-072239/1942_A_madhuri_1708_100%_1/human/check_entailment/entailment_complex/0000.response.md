Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case when `k` is 1. In this case, it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted (the original sequence itself).
2.  When `k` is greater than 1, the program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, it prints a sequence of `k` repeated `k` times. This is a valid solution because all `k` cyclic shifts of this sequence are sorted.
3.  If `n` is greater than `k` and `k` is greater than 1, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid solution. This is correct because if `n` is greater than `k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

Overall, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
