Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = 1 and n > 1. In this case, the program prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, but this sequence does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints "1 2 3", but all three cyclic shifts of this sequence are sorted: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1], and [3, 1, 2]. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
