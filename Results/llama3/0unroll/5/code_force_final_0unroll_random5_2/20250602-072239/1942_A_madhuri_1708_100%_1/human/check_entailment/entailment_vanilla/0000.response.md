Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` from the input.

If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, it prints an array of `k` elements, all of which are equal to `k`. This is a valid solution because an array with all elements equal is sorted, and all its cyclic shifts are also sorted.

If `n` is not equal to `k`, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array `a` that satisfies the conditions.

If `k` is less than 2, the program prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is equal to its 1-based index. This is a valid solution because an array with distinct elements in increasing order is sorted, and only one of its cyclic shifts (the original array itself) is sorted.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
