The code reads an integer `t` from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from stdin. It calculates two values, `A` and `B`, based on `a`, `b`, and `m`, and prints their sum.

After the loop finishes, the code does not modify any variables or read from stdin. Therefore, the only change to the initial state is that stdin is now empty, as all the input has been read.

Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin is empty**
