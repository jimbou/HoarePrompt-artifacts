Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 1 1 1, the program outputs 4, but the correct output should be 3. This is because when a = b = 1, the fireworks from both installations will be visible in the sky at the same time, and the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 3 (one from the first installation, one from the second installation, and one that is visible for one minute).

The issue with the program is that it adds 2 to the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to simply add the number of fireworks from each installation, without adding any extra value.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = m // a + m // b
        print(ans)
```

This corrected code will output the correct result for all potential cases.
