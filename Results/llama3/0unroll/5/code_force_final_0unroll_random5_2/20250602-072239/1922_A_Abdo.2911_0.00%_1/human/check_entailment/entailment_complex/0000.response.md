Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases t, the length of the strings n, and the strings a, b, and c.
2. The program constructs the template correctly by iterating over the characters of a and b. If the characters at the same position are the same, it adds the character to the template in lowercase. If the characters are different, it adds the character from a in uppercase.
3. The program checks if a and b match the template correctly. It iterates over the characters of the template and checks if the corresponding characters in a and b match the template. If any character does not match, it sets match_a_b to False.
4. The program checks if c does not match the template correctly. It iterates over the characters of the template and checks if the corresponding character in c matches the template. If any character matches, it sets match_c to False.
5. The program prints the correct output based on the values of match_a_b and match_c. If match_a_b is True and match_c is False, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the execution states provided as comments confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
