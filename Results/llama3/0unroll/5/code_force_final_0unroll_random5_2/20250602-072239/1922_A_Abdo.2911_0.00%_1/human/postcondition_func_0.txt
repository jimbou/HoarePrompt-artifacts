This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings a, b, and c. It then checks if the conditions specified in the code are met for each test case. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES' to the console; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function iterates over the test cases 't' times, where 't' is an integer read from standard input at the beginning. The input strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' remain unchanged throughout the process.
