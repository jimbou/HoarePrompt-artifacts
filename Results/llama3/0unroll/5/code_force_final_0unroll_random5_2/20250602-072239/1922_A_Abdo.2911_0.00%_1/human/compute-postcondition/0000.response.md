The value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. Since the first integer is removed from the stdin, the stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
