Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, one for each test case. The output will indicate whether the conditions specified in the code are met for each test case. The value of 't' will remain unchanged, and the input strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' will also remain unchanged. The loop will iterate 't' times, and for each iteration, it will read a new set of inputs for 'n', 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' values, one for each test case, indicating whether the conditions are met for that test case.**
