Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed t times, and the results list now contains t elements, each of which is the result of applying func_1 to a sublist of n integers from the data list, where n is the value at index in the data list. The index variable has been incremented by t + sum of all n values. The array variable now holds the last sublist of n integers from the data list. The stdin remains empty.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
