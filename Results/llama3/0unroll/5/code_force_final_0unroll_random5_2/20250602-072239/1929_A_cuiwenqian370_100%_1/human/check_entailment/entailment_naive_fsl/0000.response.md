Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved, as the largest differences are obtained by subtracting the smallest elements from the largest elements.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

*   Arrays with distinct elements
*   Arrays with duplicate elements
*   Arrays with negative elements (although the problem statement specifies that elements are between 1 and 10^9, the program can handle negative elements correctly)
*   Arrays with a length of 2 (the minimum length specified in the problem statement)

The program also handles edge cases, such as an array with all elements being equal, in which case the beauty is 0.

The use of the `abs` function ensures that the program correctly calculates the beauty even if the array contains negative elements or if the differences between consecutive elements are negative.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
