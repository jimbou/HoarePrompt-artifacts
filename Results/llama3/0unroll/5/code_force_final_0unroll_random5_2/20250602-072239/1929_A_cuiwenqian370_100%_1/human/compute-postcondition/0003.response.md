Output State: The loop has executed t times, and the results list now contains t elements, each of which is the result of applying func_1 to a sublist of n integers from the data list, where n is the value at index in the data list. The index variable has been incremented by t + sum of all n values. The array variable now holds the last sublist of n integers from the data list. The stdin remains empty.
