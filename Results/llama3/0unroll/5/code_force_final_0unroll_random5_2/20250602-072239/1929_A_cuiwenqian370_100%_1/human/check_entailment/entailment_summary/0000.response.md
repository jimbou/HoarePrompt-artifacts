Reasoning: 
The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The given program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 sorts the input array in ascending order and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This function correctly calculates the beauty of the array.

func_2 reads input from standard input, processes it in batches, applies func_1 to each batch, and prints the results. This function correctly handles the input and output operations.

Since both functions work together to correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
