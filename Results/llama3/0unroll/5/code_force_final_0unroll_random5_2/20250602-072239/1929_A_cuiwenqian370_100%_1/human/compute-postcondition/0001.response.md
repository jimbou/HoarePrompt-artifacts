Output State: The loop has executed t iterations, and the results list contains t results, each of which is the output of func_1 applied to a sublist of n integers from the data list, where n is the value at index in the data list, and index has been incremented by 1 + n after each iteration. The array variable now holds the last sublist of n integers from the data list, and the index variable points to the next element in the data list after the last sublist. The stdin remains empty.
