Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes an array as input, sorts it, and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. `func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

4. The key insight to solving this problem is that the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and the largest difference will be obtained when the smallest element is followed by the largest element, the second smallest element is followed by the second largest element, and so on.

5. The given program correctly implements this insight by sorting the array in ascending order before calculating the beauty.

6. The program also correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results for each test case.

7. There are no obvious errors or edge cases that the program does not handle.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the given program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
