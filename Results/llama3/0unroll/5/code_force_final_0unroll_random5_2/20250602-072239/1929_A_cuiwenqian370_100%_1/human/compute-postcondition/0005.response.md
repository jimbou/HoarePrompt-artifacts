Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, processes it in batches, applies the func_1 function to each batch, and prints the results. The input is expected to be a list of non-negative integers, where the first integer specifies the number of batches, and each batch is preceded by its size. The function consumes all input from standard input, leaving it empty. The output is a list of results, one for each batch, which are printed to the console.**
