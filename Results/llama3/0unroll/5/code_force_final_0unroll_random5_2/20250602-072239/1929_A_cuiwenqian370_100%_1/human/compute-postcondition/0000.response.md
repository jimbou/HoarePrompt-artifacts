Output State: **array is a list of non-negative integers, t is an integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**

The code reads the entire standard input into the `input` variable, then splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method. The first element of this list is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`. The `index` variable is set to 1, and an empty list `results` is created. The `array` variable remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The standard input is now empty, as it has been read entirely into the `input` variable.
