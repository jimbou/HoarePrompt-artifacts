Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Function 1 sorts the input array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is the correct approach to find the maximum beauty of the array, as sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it in batches, applies Function 1 to each batch, and prints the results. This is a correct way to handle multiple test cases and produce the desired output.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
