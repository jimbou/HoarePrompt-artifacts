Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers, all integers in the list are greater or equal to 1 and less or equal to 10^9.
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: array is a sorted list of integers, all integers in the list are greater or equal to 1 and less or equal to 10^9, beauty is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array, where the array is a sorted list of integers, all integers in the list are greater or equal to 1 and less or equal to 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list of integers, where all integers are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The input list is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns the total beauty value, which is the sum of these absolute differences.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of non-negative integers.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed t times, and the results list now contains t elements, each of which is the result of applying func_1 to a sublist of n integers from the data list, where n is the value at index in the data list. The index variable has been incremented by t + sum of all n values. The array variable now holds the last sublist of n integers from the data list. The stdin remains empty.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed t times, and the results list now contains t elements, each of which is the result of applying func_1 to a sublist of n integers from the data list, where n is the value at index in the data list. The index variable has been incremented by t + sum of all n values. The array variable now holds the last sublist of n integers from the data list. The stdin remains empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes it in batches, applies the func_1 function to each batch, and prints the results. The input is expected to be a list of non-negative integers, where the first integer specifies the number of batches, and each batch is preceded by its size. The function consumes all input from standard input, leaving it empty. The output is a list of results, one for each batch, which are printed to the console.
