Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array. The array can be rearranged in any way to achieve this.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, sorts it, and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is the key function that calculates the beauty of the array.

`func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it, and applies `func_1` to each test case. It then prints the results.

The correctness of the program depends on whether `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array.

The problem statement implies that the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements are maximized when the smallest element is followed by the next smallest element, and so on.

`func_1` correctly implements this approach by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The use of `abs` ensures that the differences are always positive, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
