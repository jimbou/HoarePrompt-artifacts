Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the program does not implement the binary search algorithm correctly. 

In the binary search algorithm, the loop should continue until r - l = 1, but in the program, the loop continues until r - l = 0. This means that the program will not correctly find the position of x in the permutation.

For example, if the input is:

6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6

The program will output:

0

But the correct output should be:

1
3 4

Because the program needs to swap the elements at positions 3 and 4 to make the permutation sorted, and then the binary search algorithm can find the position of 3 correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
