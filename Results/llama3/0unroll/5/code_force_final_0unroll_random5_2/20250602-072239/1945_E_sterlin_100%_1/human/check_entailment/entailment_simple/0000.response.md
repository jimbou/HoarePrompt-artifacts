Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm on a permutation of numbers, allowing for at most two swaps before the search. The program first checks if the target number is already at the correct position after the binary search. If not, it checks if the target number was seen during the search. If it was not seen, the program swaps the target number with the number at the left index. If the target number was seen, the program swaps the number at the left index with the first unseen number, and then swaps the number at the left index with the target number.

Correctness: **True**
