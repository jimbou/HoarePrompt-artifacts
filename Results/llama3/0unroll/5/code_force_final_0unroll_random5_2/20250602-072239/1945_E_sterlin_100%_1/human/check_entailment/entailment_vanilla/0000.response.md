Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) using Function 1 (func_1). This is correct as it matches the problem description.

2. For each test case, the program reads the length of the permutation (n) and the number to be found (x) using Function 2 (func_2). This is correct as it matches the problem description.

3. The program then reads the permutation (p) using Function 3 (func_3). This is correct as it matches the problem description.

4. The program then applies the binary search algorithm to find the number x in the permutation p. However, the problem statement mentions that the array must be sorted for binary search, but the permutation p is not guaranteed to be sorted.

5. To address this issue, the problem statement allows for at most 2 swap operations to be performed on the permutation before applying the binary search algorithm. The program does not explicitly perform these swap operations, which is incorrect.

6. The program then outputs the number of operations performed (k) and the indices of the swapped elements. However, since the program does not perform the swap operations, the output will be incorrect.

Based on the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary swap operations to ensure the permutation is sorted before applying the binary search algorithm.

Correctness: **False**
