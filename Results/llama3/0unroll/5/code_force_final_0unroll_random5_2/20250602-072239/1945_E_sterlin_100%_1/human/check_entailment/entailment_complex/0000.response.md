Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It uses a binary search algorithm to find the position of a given number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n`. The program first creates a dictionary `num_indx` to store the indices of the numbers in the permutation. It then initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the permutation, respectively. The program then enters a loop where it calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current range `[left, right]` and checks if the number at the midpoint is less than or equal to `x`. If it is, the program moves the `left` pointer to the midpoint. Otherwise, it moves the `right` pointer to the midpoint. The loop continues until `left` and `right` are adjacent.

After the loop, the program checks if the number at the `left` index is equal to `x`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. If the number at the `left` index is not equal to `x` and `x` is not in the permutation, the program prints 1 and the indices of the `left` index and the index of `x` in the permutation. If the number at the `left` index is not equal to `x` and `x` is in the permutation, the program prints 2 and the indices of the `left` index and the index of `x` in the permutation, and then the indices of the `left` index and the index of the number that should be at the `left` index.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the different cases that can arise during the search. It also correctly prints the number of swaps needed and the indices of the swaps.

Correctness: **True**
