Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search, with the option to perform at most two swaps before running the algorithm. The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific task.

Function 1 (`func_1`) reads an integer from standard input and returns it as an integer. This function is used to read the number of test cases.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing these integers. This function is used to read the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x`.

Function 3 (`func_3`) reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of integers. This function is used to read the permutation `p`.

The main part of the program uses these functions to read the input data and then applies the binary search algorithm to find the number `x` in the permutation `p`. The program also keeps track of the indices of the elements in the permutation using a dictionary `num_indx`.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the cases where the number `x` is not found in the permutation. It also correctly outputs the number of operations performed and the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the case where the number `x` is not found in the permutation and the element at index `left` is not equal to `x`, the program checks if the element at index `x - 1` has been seen before. If it has not been seen, the program outputs 1 and prints the indices of the elements that need to be swapped. However, this is incorrect because the element at index `x - 1` may not be the correct element to swap with the element at index `left`.

To fix this error, the program should check if the element at index `x - 1` is equal to `x` before swapping it with the element at index `left`. If it is not equal to `x`, the program should continue searching for the correct element to swap.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
