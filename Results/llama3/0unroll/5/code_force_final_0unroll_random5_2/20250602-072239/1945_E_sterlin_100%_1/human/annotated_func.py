#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer greater than 0 that was provided as input.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer greater than 0 from standard input and returns it as an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a line of space-separated integers
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers, which are the space-separated integers from the input line in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as input in the stdin, separated by spaces.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that is read from the standard input (stdin).

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as a string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string of space-separated values of any type and value
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string in stdin. The list contains values of any type and value.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string of space-separated values from standard input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string. The list contains values of any type and value.
