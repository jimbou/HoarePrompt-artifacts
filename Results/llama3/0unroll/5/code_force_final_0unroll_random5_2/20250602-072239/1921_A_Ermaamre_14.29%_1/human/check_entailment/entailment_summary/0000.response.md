Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the area of the square by finding the length of one of its sides and squaring it. The program handles all possible orientations of the square by checking the x-coordinates of the corners and calculating the difference in the y-coordinates accordingly. The use of absolute value ensures that the length of the side is always positive, regardless of the order of the coordinates. The program also correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
