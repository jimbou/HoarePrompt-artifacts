Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program first reads the number of test cases 'a' and then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

The program then checks the coordinates to determine which pair of points represents the horizontal side of the square and which pair represents the vertical side. It does this by comparing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points.

Once it has determined the horizontal and vertical sides, it calculates the length of the side by taking the absolute difference between the y-coordinates (for the vertical side) or the x-coordinates (for the horizontal side).

Finally, it calculates the area of the square by squaring the length of the side and prints the result.

The program correctly handles the different possible orientations of the square and correctly calculates the area.

Correctness: **True**
