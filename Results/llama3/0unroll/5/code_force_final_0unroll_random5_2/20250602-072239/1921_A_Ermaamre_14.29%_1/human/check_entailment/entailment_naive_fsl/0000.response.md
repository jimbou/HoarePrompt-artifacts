Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39

The program will output:

9
4
784

However, the correct output should be:

9
4
784
9

The program fails to handle the case where the coordinates of the corners are given in a different order. The program assumes that the coordinates are given in a specific order, which is not guaranteed by the problem description.

A correct solution would be to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, and then calculate the area of the square using the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates.

Here is a correct solution:

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())
        (x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        (x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())
        (x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())
        x_coords = [x1, x2, x3, x4]
        y_coords = [y1, y2, y3, y4]
        x_min = min(x_coords)
        x_max = max(x_coords)
        y_min = min(y_coords)
        y_max = max(y_coords)
        res = abs(x_max - x_min)
        print(res ** 2)

This solution correctly handles all potential cases and outputs the correct area of the square.
