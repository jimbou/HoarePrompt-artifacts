Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains  `a` test cases. Each test case contains four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin still contains `a` test cases, each with four lines of two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
