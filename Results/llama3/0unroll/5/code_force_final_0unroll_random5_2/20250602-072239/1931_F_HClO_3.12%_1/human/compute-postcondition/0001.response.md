Output State: **The loop will execute 't' number of times, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). In each iteration, it will read two integers 'n' and 'k' from the standard input, where 'k' is between 1 and 'n' (inclusive) and 'n' is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). It will then read 'k' lines of 'n' distinct integers from 1 to 'n'. The loop will compare the integers in each line and print 'yes' if they are in the same order, and 'no' otherwise.**
