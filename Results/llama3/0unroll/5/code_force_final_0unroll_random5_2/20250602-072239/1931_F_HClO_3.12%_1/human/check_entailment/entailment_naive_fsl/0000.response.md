Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is:

```
3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
```

The program should output "NO" because there is no order that all screenshots correspond to. However, the program outputs "YES" which is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the first two screenshots are consistent with each other, and then it assumes that all the other screenshots are consistent with the first two. However, this is not necessarily true. The program should check all pairs of screenshots to ensure that they are consistent with each other.
