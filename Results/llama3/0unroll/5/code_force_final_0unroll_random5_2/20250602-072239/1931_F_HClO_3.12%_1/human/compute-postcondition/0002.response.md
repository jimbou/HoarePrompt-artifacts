Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers 'n' and 'k' followed by 'k' lines of 'n' distinct integers. It then checks if the integers in each line are in the same order, and prints 'yes' if they are, and 'no' otherwise. The function handles cases where 'k' is 1 or 2 separately, and for 'k' greater than 2, it inserts a missing element into one of the lines and checks if the resulting lines are in the same order.**
