The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` first, followed by `t` test cases. Since `t` is accepted from the input, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `k` <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `n` * `k` <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
