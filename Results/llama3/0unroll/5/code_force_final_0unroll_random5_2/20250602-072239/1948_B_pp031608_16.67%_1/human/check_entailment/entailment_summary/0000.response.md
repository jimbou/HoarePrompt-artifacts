Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The program attempts to sort the list by splitting the digits of a number if it is greater than 10 and the previous number is greater than the current number. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the list can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the current number is greater than the previous number and if the previous number is greater than 10. If these conditions are met, it splits the previous number into its digits and inserts them into the list. However, this approach does not consider all possible scenarios.

For example, consider the list [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first number into its digits, resulting in the list [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. However, it will not split the third number (45) into its digits, even though it is greater than 10 and the previous number (3) is less than the current number (45). As a result, the program will incorrectly determine that the list cannot be sorted in non-decreasing order.

A correct solution would involve a more comprehensive approach that considers all possible scenarios and splits the digits of a number only when necessary to maintain the sorted order of the list.

Correctness: **False**
