Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-descending order using the operation of deleting an element and inserting its digits in the same position.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `list1`.

3. It then iterates over the array from the second element to the last element. For each element, it checks if the array is not sorted using the `func_1` function. If the array is not sorted and the previous element is greater than the current element and also greater than 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them into the array.

4. After the iteration, it checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function. If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

The `func_1` function checks if the array is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks if the array is sorted after splitting the previous element, but it does not continue checking the rest of the array after the split operation. This means that even if the array can be sorted by splitting elements, the program may still print 'No' if the array is not sorted after the initial split operation.

For example, consider the array [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not continue checking the rest of the array. Since the array [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] is not sorted, the program will print 'No', even though the array can be sorted by splitting the elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
