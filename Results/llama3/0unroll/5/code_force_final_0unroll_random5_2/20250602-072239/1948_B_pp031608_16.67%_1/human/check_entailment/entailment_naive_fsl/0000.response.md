Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the third element into [4, 5] because it only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10. However, in this case, the third element (45) is greater than 10 and can be split into [4, 5], which would result in a sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. The program does not handle this case correctly.

The program only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10, but it does not consider the case where the current element is greater than 10 and can be split into smaller elements that would result in a sorted array.
