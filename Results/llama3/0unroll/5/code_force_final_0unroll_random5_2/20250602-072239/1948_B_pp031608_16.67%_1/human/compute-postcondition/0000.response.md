Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of integers.**

In this output state, `lst` remains unchanged as a list of integers, and a new variable `sorted_lst` is introduced, which is a sorted version of the original list `lst`. The sorting is done in ascending order by default.
