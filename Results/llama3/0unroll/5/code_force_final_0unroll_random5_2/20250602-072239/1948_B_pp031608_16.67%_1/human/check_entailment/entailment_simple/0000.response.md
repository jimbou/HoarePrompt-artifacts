Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the aforementioned operation any number of times (possibly zero). The program iterates through the input list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element. If this condition is met and the current element is greater than 10, the program splits the current element into two digits and inserts them into the list. After iterating through the entire list, the program checks if the list is sorted using the function `func_1`. If the list is sorted, the program prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

However, there are a few issues with the program. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, but based on the comment, it seems to check if a list is sorted. The main issue is that the program only checks if the current element is greater than the next element and splits it if necessary. It does not consider the case where the current element is less than or equal to the next element, but the next element is greater than 10 and can be split to make the list sorted.

For example, consider the input list [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the third element into [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67] because it only checks if the current element is greater than the next element.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
