Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
3. It calculates the last element of the list `last` and initializes a variable `curr` to 0.
4. It then iterates over the list of numbers. For each non-zero number, it adds the difference between the number and the last element to `curr`.
5. If `curr` is 0 at the end of the iteration, it means that the sum of the differences between each non-zero number and the last number is 0, which means it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. In this case, it prints 'YES'.
6. If `curr` is not 0, it means that the sum of the differences is not 0, which means it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. In this case, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly implements the logic and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
