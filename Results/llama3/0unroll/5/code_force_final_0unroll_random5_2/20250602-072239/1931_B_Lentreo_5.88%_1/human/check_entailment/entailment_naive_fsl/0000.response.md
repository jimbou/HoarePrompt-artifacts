Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The program only checks if the sum of the differences between each container and the last container is zero, which is not a sufficient condition.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "NO", but it's actually possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the first container to the second and third containers.

The correct solution should check if the prefix sum of the array is always greater than or equal to the average value multiplied by the current index. This is because we can always pour water from the current container to the next containers to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Here is a correct solution:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        avg = sum(nums) // n
        prefix_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum += nums[i]
            if prefix_sum < avg * (i + 1):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

This solution correctly checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the current container to the next containers.
