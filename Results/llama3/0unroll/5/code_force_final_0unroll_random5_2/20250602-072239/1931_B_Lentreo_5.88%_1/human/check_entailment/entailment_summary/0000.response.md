Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
2. It calculates the target amount of water in each container by taking the last element of `nums` as the target amount. This is correct because the problem states that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so the target amount is the same for all containers.
3. It calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero number and the target amount. This is correct because the problem allows pouring water from one container to another, and the difference between the current amount and the target amount represents the amount of water that needs to be poured.
4. If the sum of differences is zero, it means that all containers can be made to have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another. In this case, the program correctly prints 'YES'.
5. If the sum of differences is not zero, it means that it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another. In this case, the program correctly prints 'NO'.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
