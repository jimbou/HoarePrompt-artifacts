The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. So after the code is executed, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in the stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.**
