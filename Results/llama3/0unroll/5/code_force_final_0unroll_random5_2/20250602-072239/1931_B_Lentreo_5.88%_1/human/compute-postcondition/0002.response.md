Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs a list of 'YES' or 'NO' values. For each test case, it takes a list of integers, calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero number and the last number in the list, and prints 'YES' if the sum is zero, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function consumes the input and leaves the value of `t` unchanged.**
