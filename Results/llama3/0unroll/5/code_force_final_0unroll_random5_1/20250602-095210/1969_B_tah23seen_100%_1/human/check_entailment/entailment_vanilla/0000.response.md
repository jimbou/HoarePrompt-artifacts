Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum total cost.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Initialize a variable `cost` to 0, which will store the minimum total cost.
2. Initialize a variable `one` to 0, which will count the number of consecutive '1's in the string.
3. Iterate through each character `i` in the string `s`.
4. If `i` is '1', increment the `one` counter.
5. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it means we've encountered a '0' after a sequence of '1's. In this case, increment the `cost` by `one + 1`, which represents the cost of shifting the sequence of '1's to the right of the '0'.
6. After iterating through the entire string, return the `cost` value.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the sequences of '1's and '0's in the string and calculates the minimum cost to shift these sequences to achieve a non-descending order.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The problem statement allows for cyclic shifts, which means that the last character of the string can be shifted to the beginning. The program does not account for this possibility.

For example, consider the input string "10". The program will output a cost of 2, which is incorrect. The correct solution is to shift the last character '0' to the beginning, resulting in the string "01", which has a cost of 1.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider the cyclic shift of the last character to the beginning.

Correctness: **False**
