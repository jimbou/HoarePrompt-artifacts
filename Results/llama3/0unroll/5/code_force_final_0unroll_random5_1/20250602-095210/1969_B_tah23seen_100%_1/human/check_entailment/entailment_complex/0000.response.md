Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

The program works by iterating over the string and keeping track of the number of '1's encountered so far (in the variable `one`). Whenever a '0' is encountered after a '1', it increments the cost by the number of '1's encountered so far plus one. This is because a cyclic shift operation is needed to move the '1's to the left of the '0'.

The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted, in which case the cost is zero. It also correctly handles the case where the string contains only '0's or only '1's, in which case the cost is also zero.

The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the string, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
