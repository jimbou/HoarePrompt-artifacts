Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and calculates the total cost.

The function initializes a variable `cost` to 0 and another variable `one` to 0. It then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '1', it increments the `one` variable. If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it increments the `cost` variable by `one + 1`. Finally, it returns the total `cost`.

The program's logic is based on the idea that the cost of a cyclic shift is equal to the length of the substring being shifted. By counting the number of '1's and the number of '0's that follow a '1', the program is effectively counting the number of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

The execution summary confirms that the function calculates and returns the total cost correctly, and the input string remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.

Correctness: **True**
