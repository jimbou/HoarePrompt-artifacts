#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s) of length at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5.
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations is: s is unchanged (binary string of length at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5), cost is the total number of '1's in the string plus the number of '0's that follow a '1', and one is the total number of '1's in the string.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of '1's in the string plus the number of '0's that follow a '1' in the binary string s.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total cost of a binary string, where the cost is defined as the total number of '1's in the string plus the number of '0's that follow a '1'. The function takes a binary string as input and returns an integer representing the total cost. The input string remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
