Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The optimal strategy is to choose the substring "10" and perform a cyclic shift, resulting in a cost of 2. However, the program will choose the substring "1" and perform a cyclic shift, resulting in a cost of 1, and then choose the substring "0" and perform a cyclic shift, resulting in a cost of 1, for a total cost of 2.

The issue with the program is that it only considers the cost of shifting the ones to the right, but it does not consider the cost of shifting the zeros to the left. In the case of the input string "101", the program does not consider the cost of shifting the zero to the left, which is 1.

To fix this issue, the program needs to consider the cost of shifting both the ones and the zeros. One possible solution is to count the number of ones and zeros in the string, and then calculate the cost of shifting the ones to the right and the zeros to the left separately. The total cost is then the minimum of these two costs.

Here is an example of a corrected program:
```
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    zero = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        else:
            zero += 1
    cost = min(one, zero)
    return cost
```
This program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order by considering the cost of shifting both the ones and the zeros.
