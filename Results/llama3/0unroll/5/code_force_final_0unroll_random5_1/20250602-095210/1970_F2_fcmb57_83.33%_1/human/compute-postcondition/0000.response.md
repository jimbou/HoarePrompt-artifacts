Output State: **a is a list of two integers, b is a list of strings, x is the first integer in a, y is the second integer in a, dx is the first string in b, dy is the second string in b**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each using tuple unpacking to assign values to variables. The first line assigns the first and second elements of list `a` to variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The second line assigns the first and second elements of list `b` to variables `dx` and `dy`, respectively.

After executing the code, the values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are determined by the elements of lists `a` and `b`. The original lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
