Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the Quidditch game, including player movements, catching and throwing the Quaffle, scoring goals, and eliminating players who come into contact with the Bludger. The program also correctly handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding a point to the opposing team. The output is also correctly formatted, with events printed in ascending order of time and the final score printed at the end.

However, there is a small mistake in the function call `players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code. It seems that the function is supposed to update the position of a player based on the movement direction. The correct implementation of this function is missing in the code.

Correctness: **False**
