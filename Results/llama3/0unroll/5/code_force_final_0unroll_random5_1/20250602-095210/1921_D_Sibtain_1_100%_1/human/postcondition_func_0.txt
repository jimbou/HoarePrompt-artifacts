This function calculates and prints the minimum total absolute difference between the elements of two arrays for each test case. It accepts multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of two arrays, and returns the minimum total absolute difference for each test case. The function handles various cases, including when the arrays have identical elements, when one array has a single element, and when the arrays have distinct elements. It outputs the minimum total absolute difference for each test case, one on each line.
