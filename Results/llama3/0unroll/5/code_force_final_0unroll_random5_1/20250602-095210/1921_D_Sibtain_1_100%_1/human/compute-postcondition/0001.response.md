Functionality: This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two arrays of integers. It calculates and prints the minimum total absolute difference between the elements of the two arrays for each test case. If the arrays contain only identical elements and are equal, it prints 0. Otherwise, it sorts the arrays and iterates through them to find the minimum total absolute difference, considering the maximum difference between corresponding elements from the start and end of the arrays. The result is printed for each test case.
