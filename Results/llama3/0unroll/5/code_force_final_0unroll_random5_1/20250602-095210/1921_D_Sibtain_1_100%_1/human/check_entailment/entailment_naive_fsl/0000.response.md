Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by Vasya. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first checks if all elements in both arrays are the same. If they are, it prints 0 because there's no way to make the arrays different.

2. It then sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `c` in descending order. This is because the maximum difference will be obtained by matching the smallest elements in `a` with the largest elements in `c`, and the largest elements in `a` with the smallest elements in `c`.

3. If `a` has only one element, the program prints the maximum difference between this element and the maximum or minimum element in `c`.

4. If `a` has more than one element, the program uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate over `a` and `c` respectively. It calculates the difference between the current elements in `a` and `c` and adds the maximum of these differences to the total difference `ans`.

5. The program then moves the pointers `i` and `j` based on which difference is larger. If the difference between the current elements in `a` and `c` is larger, it moves `i`. Otherwise, it moves `j`. This ensures that the maximum difference is always chosen.

6. Finally, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, including when all elements in both arrays are the same, when `a` has only one element, and when `a` has more than one element. Therefore, the program is correct.
