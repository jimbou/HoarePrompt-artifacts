Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` that satisfies two conditions:

1. Each element `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
2. Exactly `k` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted.

The program attempts to solve this problem by considering two cases:

Case 1: `k >= 2`

* If `n == k`, the program prints an array of `k` elements, all equal to `k`. This is incorrect because the array `[k, k, ..., k]` has `n` sorted cyclic shifts, not `k`. For example, if `n = k = 3`, the array `[3, 3, 3]` has 3 sorted cyclic shifts, not 2.
* If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`, indicating that no solution exists. This is correct because if `k >= 2`, there is no array `a` that satisfies the conditions.

Case 2: `k < 2`

* The program prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is `j + 1` for `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This is incorrect because the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` has only 1 sorted cyclic shift, not `k`. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the array `[1, 2, 3]` has only 1 sorted cyclic shift, not 2.

In summary, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k`, and it does not correctly construct an array that satisfies the conditions for `k < 2`.

Correctness: **False**
