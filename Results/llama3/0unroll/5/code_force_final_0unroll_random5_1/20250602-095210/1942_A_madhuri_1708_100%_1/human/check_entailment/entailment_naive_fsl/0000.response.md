Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `k` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, the program prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, but this sequence does not satisfy the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

For example, when `n` is 3 and `k` is 1, the program prints `[1, 2, 3]`, but this sequence has 3 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`, which is not equal to `k`.

The correct solution should print a sequence that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For example, when `n` is 3 and `k` is 1, the correct output should be `[69420, 69, 420]`, which has only 1 sorted cyclic shift: `[69, 420, 69420]`.
