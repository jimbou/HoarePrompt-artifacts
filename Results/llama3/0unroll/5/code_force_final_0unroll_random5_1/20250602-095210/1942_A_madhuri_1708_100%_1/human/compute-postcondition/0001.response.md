Functionality: **This function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input pairs of integers n and k. If k is 1, it outputs the numbers from 1 to n. If k is greater than 1 and n is equal to k, it outputs k repeated k times. If k is greater than 1 and n is not equal to k, it outputs -1. The function processes multiple pairs of integers and outputs the corresponding results in separate lines.**
