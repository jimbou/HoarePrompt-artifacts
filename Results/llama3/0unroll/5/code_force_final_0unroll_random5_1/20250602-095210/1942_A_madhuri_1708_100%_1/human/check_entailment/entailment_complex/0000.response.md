Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "Trade Winds" problem, which involves finding an array that satisfies certain conditions based on the input integers n and k. The program processes multiple pairs of integers and outputs the corresponding results in separate lines.

The program's logic is as follows:

- If k is 1, it outputs the numbers from 1 to n. This is because when k is 1, there should be exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which can be achieved by having the numbers in ascending order.

- If k is greater than 1 and n is equal to k, it outputs k repeated k times. This is because when k is equal to n, all cyclic shifts should be sorted, which can be achieved by having all elements equal.

- If k is greater than 1 and n is not equal to k, it outputs -1. This is because when k is greater than 1 and not equal to n, it is impossible to find an array that satisfies the conditions.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles all possible cases and outputs the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
