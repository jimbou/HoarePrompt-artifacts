Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where k is 1, k is greater than 1 and n is equal to k, and k is greater than 1 and n is not equal to k. For k = 1, it generates a sorted array with distinct elements. For k = n, it generates a sorted array with all elements equal to k. For k > 1 and n â‰  k, it correctly outputs -1 as there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions.

Correctness: **True**
