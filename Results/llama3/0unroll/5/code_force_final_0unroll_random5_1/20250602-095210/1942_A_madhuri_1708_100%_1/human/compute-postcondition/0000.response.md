Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each representing the result of the corresponding pair of integers n and k. If k is 1, the line will contain the numbers from 1 to n. If k is greater than 1 and n is equal to k, the line will contain k repeated k times. If k is greater than 1 and n is not equal to k, the line will contain -1.**
