Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
2. The program generates the sequence of lowercase letters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet using the `chr` function and a loop. This is correct.
3. The program repeats the sequence a certain number of times based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is 1, it repeats the sequence `n` times. If `n` is greater than 1 and `k` is greater than 1, it repeats the sequence twice. If `n` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1, it repeats the sequence once. This logic is correct and matches the problem description.
4. The program prints the generated strings to the output, with the number of strings equal to the value of `t`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
