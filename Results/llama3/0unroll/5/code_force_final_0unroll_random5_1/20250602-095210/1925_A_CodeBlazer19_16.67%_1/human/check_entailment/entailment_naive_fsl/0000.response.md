Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 2 and k = 3, the program outputs "abcbac", but this string does not contain all possible substrings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets. The correct output for this case should be "abcbacba".

The issue with the program is that it only repeats the string "s" twice when k is not equal to 1, but this is not enough to ensure that all possible substrings of length n are included. The program needs to repeat the string "s" n times to ensure that all possible substrings are included.

Here is an example of a correct program:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        print(n * s)
```

This program repeats the string "s" n times, ensuring that all possible substrings of length n are included.
