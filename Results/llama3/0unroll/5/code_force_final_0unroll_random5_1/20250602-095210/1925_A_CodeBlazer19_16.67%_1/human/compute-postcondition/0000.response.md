The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains one or more lines of input, each line containing two positive integers n and k, separated by a space. The first line is accepted as input and converted to an integer, which is assigned to t. The remaining lines are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains one or more lines of input. Each line contains two positive integers n and k, separated by a space, such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
