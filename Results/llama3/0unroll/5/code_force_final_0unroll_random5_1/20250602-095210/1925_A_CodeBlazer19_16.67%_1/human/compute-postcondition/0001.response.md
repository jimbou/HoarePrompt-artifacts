Output State: **The output state will be a series of strings, each consisting of a sequence of lowercase letters, repeated a certain number of times. The sequence of letters will start from 'a' and go up to the k-th letter of the alphabet (where k is the second number in each input line). If k is 1, the sequence will be repeated n times. If k is greater than 1, the sequence will be repeated twice if n is greater than 1, and once if n is 1. The number of strings in the output will be equal to the value of t.**
