This function reads input from stdin, where each line contains two positive integers n and k, and generates a series of strings based on these inputs. For each input line, it creates a sequence of lowercase letters from 'a' to the k-th letter of the alphabet, and repeats this sequence a certain number of times: n times if k is 1, and twice if n is greater than 1 and k is greater than 1, or once if n is 1 and k is greater than 1. The function then prints these strings to the output, with the number of strings equal to the value of t, which is read from the input before the loop.
