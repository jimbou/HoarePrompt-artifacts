    #State: *n is a positive integer, password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is a list of all the lowercase Latin letters in the password, digits is a list of all the digits in the password.

    #State: The loop will not execute all the iterations and will terminate early if it encounters a lowercase Latin letter followed by a digit in the password string, returning 'NO'. If no such pair is found, the loop will execute all iterations without returning, and the state will remain unchanged.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES' indicating that no lowercase Latin letter followed by a digit was found in the password string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given password string meets certain conditions. It accepts a password string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function returns 'YES' if the password string does not contain a lowercase Latin letter followed by a digit, and the letters and digits in the password are sorted in ascending order. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
