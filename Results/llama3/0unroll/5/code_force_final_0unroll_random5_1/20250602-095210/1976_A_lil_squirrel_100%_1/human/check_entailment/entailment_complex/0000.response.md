Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly separates the input password into lists of letters and digits.
2. It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing them with their sorted versions. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
3. It checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password by iterating through the password string. If it finds such a pair, it returns 'NO'.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. The execution states provided as comments also confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
