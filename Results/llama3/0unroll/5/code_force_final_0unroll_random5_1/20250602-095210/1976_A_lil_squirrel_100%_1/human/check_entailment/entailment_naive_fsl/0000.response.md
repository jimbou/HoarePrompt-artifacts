Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It first separates the letters and digits from the password and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'. Then it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If so, it returns 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with a mix of letters and digits. It also correctly handles cases where the letters or digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order, and cases where there is a digit that comes after a letter.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
