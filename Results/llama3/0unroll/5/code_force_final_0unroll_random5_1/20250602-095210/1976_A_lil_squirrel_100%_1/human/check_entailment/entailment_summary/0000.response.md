Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to verify if a given password meets the specified conditions. The conditions are:

1.  The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2.  There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
3.  All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4.  All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the password length `n` and the password string as input. It separates the letters and digits into two lists, checks if they are sorted, and verifies that no digit comes after a letter in the password.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the function. It checks the conditions specified in the problem description and returns 'YES' if the password meets all the conditions, and 'NO' otherwise.

Based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
