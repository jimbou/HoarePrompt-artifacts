Reasoning:
The given program is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` only handles the cases where the length of the array is 2 or not 2, but it does not provide a general solution for arrays of any length. It also does not use the input array `a` at all, which is necessary to calculate the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

The program also does not follow the problem's requirements, as it does not output the maximum sum and the number of operations, and it does not provide the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

Correctness: **False**
