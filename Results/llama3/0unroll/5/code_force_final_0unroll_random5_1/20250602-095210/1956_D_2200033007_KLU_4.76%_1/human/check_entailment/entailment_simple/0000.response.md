Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the input list is 2, and when the length of the input list is not 2. In the first case, it prints '4 1' and '1 2', which is correct for the example input [0, 1]. However, this is not a general solution for all possible inputs of length 2.

In the second case, it prints '13 0', which is correct for the example input [1, 3, 9], but again, this is not a general solution for all possible inputs of length not equal to 2.

The program does not provide a general solution for maximizing the sum of the elements of the array a. It does not consider all possible cases and does not provide a correct solution for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
