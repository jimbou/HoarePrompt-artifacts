Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding the maximum sum of elements of the array `a` and constructing a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. However, the program only checks if the length of the array `a` is 2, and if so, prints a hardcoded answer. If the length of the array `a` is not 2, it prints another hardcoded answer. This approach does not consider the actual values in the array `a` and does not provide a correct solution to the problem.

The program also does not perform any operations on the array `a` as required by the problem statement. It simply prints a message based on the length of the array `a` without considering the values in the array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not provide a valid solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
