Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. Here's why:

1. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array is 2 and when the length of the array is 3. It does not handle any other cases.

2. The program does not actually calculate the maximum sum of the elements of the array. It simply prints a hardcoded value for the sum and the number of operations.

3. The program does not perform any operations on the array. It simply prints the initial values of the sum and the number of operations.

4. The function `func_1` is not defined correctly. It only handles the cases when the length of the array is 2 or 3, and it does not perform any operations on the array.

5. The program does not use the input values correctly. It reads the input values but does not use them to calculate the maximum sum of the elements of the array.

6. The program does not handle the case when the length of the array is greater than 3.

7. The program does not handle the case when the array contains negative numbers or non-integer numbers.

8. The program does not handle the case when the array is empty.

Correctness: **False**
