Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. It only handles the cases where the input is 2 or 3, and it does not provide a general solution for any input size.

For example, if the input is 4 and the array is [1, 100, 2, 1], the program will not produce the correct output. The correct output should be 105 2 and the operations (3 3) and (3 4), but the program will only print 13 0, which is incorrect.

The program does not have a general algorithm to solve the problem for any input size, it only has hardcoded solutions for specific cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.
