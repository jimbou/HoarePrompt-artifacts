Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles (or operations) required to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function works by first finding the indices `i` and `j` that point to the first and last elements of the array that are different from their adjacent elements. If all elements in the array are the same, `i` and `j` will point to the second last element of the array.

If the first and last elements of the array are the same, the function returns the maximum value between the difference of `j` and `i` minus 1, and 0. This is because the array can be made equal by replacing all elements between `i` and `j` with the first element of the array.

If the first and last elements of the array are not the same, the function returns the maximum value between the minimum of `n-i-1` and `j`, and 0. This is because the array can be made equal by replacing all elements between the first element that is different from the next element and the last element with the last element of the array.

The program then calls the `func_1` function for each test case and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of an array equal. The function `func_1` correctly handles the cases where all elements in the array are the same, and where the first and last elements of the array are the same or different. The program also correctly reads the input and prints the result for each test case.
