#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: i is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state is that the variable i will point to the first element in the array that is different from the next element. If all elements in the array are the same, i will point to the second last element in the array. The other variables, n and j, remain unchanged.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state is that the variable j will point to the first element in the array that is different from the next element. If all elements in the array are the same, j will point to the second last element in the array. The other variables, n and i, remain unchanged.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between the difference of j and i minus 1, and 0, where j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same, and the first element of arr is equal to the last element of arr.
    #State: *j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same. Additionally, the first element of arr is not equal to the last element of arr
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of n-i-1 and j, and 0, where j is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same, and i is an index that is not specified in the initial state but is used in the calculation.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray with distinct elements. If the input list has all identical elements, the function returns 0. If the first and last elements of the list are the same, the function returns the maximum length of the subarray with distinct elements within the range of the second last element to the first element that is different from the next element. Otherwise, the function returns the maximum length of the subarray with distinct elements within the range of the last element to the first element that is different from the next element.
