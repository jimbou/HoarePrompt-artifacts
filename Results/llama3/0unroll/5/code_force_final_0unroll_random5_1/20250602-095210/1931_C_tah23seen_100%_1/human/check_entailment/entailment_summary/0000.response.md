Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of burles (or operations) required to make all elements of an array equal. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes an array as input and returns the minimum number of burles required.

The function `func_1` works by first finding the longest contiguous subarray with distinct elements. If the input array has all identical elements, the function returns 0. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, the function returns the maximum length of the subarray with distinct elements within the range of the second last element to the first element that is different from the next element. Otherwise, the function returns the maximum length of the subarray with distinct elements within the range of the last element to the first element that is different from the next element.

The program then reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements. It then calls the function `func_1` with the array as input and prints the result.

The execution summary provided explains the behavior of the function `func_1` and how it calculates the minimum number of burles required.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly identifies the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
