Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: i is the index of the first element in arr that is different from the next element, or the second last index of arr if all elements are the same.

In natural language, the output state is that the variable i will point to the first element in the array that is different from the next element. If all elements in the array are the same, i will point to the second last element in the array. The other variables, n and j, remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
