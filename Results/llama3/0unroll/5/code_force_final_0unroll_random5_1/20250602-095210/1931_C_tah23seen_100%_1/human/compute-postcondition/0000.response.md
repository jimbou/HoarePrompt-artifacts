Output State: **arr is a list of integers, i is 0, n is the length of arr, j is the last index of arr**

The code initializes three variables: `i`, `n`, and `j`. The first line sets `i` to 0. The second line assigns the length of the list `arr` to `n`. The third line assigns the last index of `arr` to `j`. Since `arr` is a list of integers, its length and last index are determined by the number of elements in the list. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` are now fixed, and `arr` remains unchanged.
