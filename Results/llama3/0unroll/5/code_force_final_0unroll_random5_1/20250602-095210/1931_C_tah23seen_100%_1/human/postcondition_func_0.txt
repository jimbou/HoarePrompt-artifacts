This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray with distinct elements. If the input list has all identical elements, the function returns 0. If the first and last elements of the list are the same, the function returns the maximum length of the subarray with distinct elements within the range of the second last element to the first element that is different from the next element. Otherwise, the function returns the maximum length of the subarray with distinct elements within the range of the last element to the first element that is different from the next element.
