Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings a, b, and c.

The program first checks if string c is equal to either string a or string b. If it is, the program prints 'NO' because string c would match the template t.

If string c is not equal to either string a or string b, the program then checks if there exists a character in string c that is not present in the corresponding position in either string a or string b. If such a character is found, the program prints 'YES' because a template t can be formed that matches strings a and b but not string c.

If no such character is found, the program prints 'NO' because no template t can be formed that matches strings a and b but not string c.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
