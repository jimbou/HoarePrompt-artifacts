Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the strings a and b have the same character at a certain position, but the string c has a different character at that position. In this case, the program should print 'YES' because a template can be created that matches a and b but not c. However, the program will print 'NO' because it only checks if the character in c is not in a or b, but it does not consider the case where a and b have the same character.

For example, if the input is:

3
a
a
b

The program will print 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because a template 'A' can be created that matches 'a' and 'a' but not 'b'.
