Output State: **`tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

In this output state, the value of `tests` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, as described in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected.
