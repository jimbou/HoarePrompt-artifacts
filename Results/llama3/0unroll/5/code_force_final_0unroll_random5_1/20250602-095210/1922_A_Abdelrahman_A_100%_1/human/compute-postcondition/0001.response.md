Output State: **The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, depending on whether the string 'c' can be formed by taking characters from strings 'a' and 'b' at the same position. The value of 'tests' remains unchanged, and the stdin is empty after consuming all the test cases.**
