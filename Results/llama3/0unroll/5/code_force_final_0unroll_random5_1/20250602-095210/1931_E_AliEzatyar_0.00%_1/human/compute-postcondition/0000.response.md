Output State: **`num` is an integer (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, `counter` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `counter` and assigned it the value 0. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `num` and the newly introduced variable `counter` with its assigned value.
