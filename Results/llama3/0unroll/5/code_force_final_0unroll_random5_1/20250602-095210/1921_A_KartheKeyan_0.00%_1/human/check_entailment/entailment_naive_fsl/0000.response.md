Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The issue lies in the calculation of the area. The program calculates the distance between two opposite corners (p1 and p2) and then multiplies the square roots of these distances. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the area of a square.

The correct way to calculate the area of a square is to find the length of one side and then square it. The program does not do this. Instead, it calculates the distance between two opposite corners, which is the diagonal of the square, and then multiplies the square roots of these distances. This will not give the correct area of the square.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2

The program will calculate the area as:

p1 = (4-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18
p2 = (4-1)^2 + (2-5)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18
res = sqrt(18) * sqrt(18) = 18

However, the correct area of the square is 9, not 18.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
