Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for the number of '1's before each '0' and adds the count of '1's plus one to the answer. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to sort the string by cyclically shifting substrings.

For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The optimal way to sort the string is to cyclically shift the substring "10" to get "01", which has a cost of 2. However, the program does not consider this case and instead adds 2 to the answer because there is one '1' before the '0'.

A correct approach would be to find the longest contiguous substring of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost of cyclically shifting these substrings to sort the string.
