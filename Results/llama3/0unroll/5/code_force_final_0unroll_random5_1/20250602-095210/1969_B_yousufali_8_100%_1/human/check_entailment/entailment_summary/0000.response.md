Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function `func_1()` takes a binary string as input and calculates the total number of '0's that are preceded by at least one '1'. This is equivalent to finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted, as each '0' that is preceded by a '1' requires a cyclic shift operation to move it to the correct position.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer `t` from standard input, then reads `t` binary strings from standard input and processes each string by calling `func_1()` `t` times. This is equivalent to solving the problem for each test case.

Since `func_1()` correctly calculates the minimum total cost for a single binary string, and `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each one, the program as a whole correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
