Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a binary string `s` as input and initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of consecutive '1's and `ans` to store the total cost. It then iterates through the string, incrementing `n` whenever it encounters a '1'. When it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it increments `ans` by `n + 1`, which represents the cost of shifting the consecutive '1's to the right of the '0'. Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The provided program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost. The key insight is that the cost of shifting a substring is equal to its length, and by counting the number of consecutive '1's and adding the cost of shifting them to the right of each '0', the program effectively calculates the minimum total cost.

Correctness: **True**
