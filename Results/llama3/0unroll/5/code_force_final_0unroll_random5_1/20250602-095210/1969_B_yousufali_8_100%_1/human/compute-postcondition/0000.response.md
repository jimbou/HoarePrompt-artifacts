Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing a binary string s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4. The remaining input in stdin consists of `t` lines, each containing a binary string `s` with a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5, where each character `s_i` is either 0 or 1.
