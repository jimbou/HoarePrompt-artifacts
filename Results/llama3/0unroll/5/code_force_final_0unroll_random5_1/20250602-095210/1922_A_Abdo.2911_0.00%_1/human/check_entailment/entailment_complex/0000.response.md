Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n.

2. The program constructs a template string by iterating over the characters of strings a and b. If the characters at the same position in a and b are the same, it adds the character to the template in lowercase. If the characters are different, it adds the character from string a in uppercase to the template.

3. The program checks if strings a and b match the template by iterating over the characters of the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

4. The program checks if string c matches the template by iterating over the characters of the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is different from the lowercase version of the template character.

5. The program prints 'YES' if strings a and b match the template and string c does not match the template. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

6. The program correctly handles all test cases and prints the results to the console, leaving the input state unchanged.

Correctness: **True**
