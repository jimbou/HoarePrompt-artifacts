Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The program first creates a template by iterating over the characters of strings a and b. If the characters at the same position in a and b are the same, it adds the character to the template in lowercase. If the characters are different, it adds the character from a in uppercase to the template.

Then, it checks if strings a and b match the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in a and b are not the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

Finally, it checks if string c does not match the template. If a character in the template is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is not the same as the template character. If a character in the template is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in c is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

If strings a and b match the template and string c does not match the template, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when strings a and b have the same characters at the same position, when strings a and b have different characters at the same position, and when string c has the same or different characters at the same position as the template.

Therefore, the program is correct and should print the expected output for all possible inputs.
