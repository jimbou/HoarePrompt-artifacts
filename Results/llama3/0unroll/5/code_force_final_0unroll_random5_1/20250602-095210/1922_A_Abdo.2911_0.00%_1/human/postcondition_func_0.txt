This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. It then checks if the strings a and b can be transformed into a common template by making some characters in a or b uppercase, and if the resulting template matches string c except for the uppercase characters. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results to the console, leaving the input state unchanged.
