Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program takes the number of test cases as input, and for each test case, it takes the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b) as input.

The program calculates the optimal value of k, which is the number of buns to be sold at the modified price. The value of k is calculated as the minimum of n and b - a. This is because if b is less than or equal to a, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price, and if b is greater than a, it is optimal to sell k buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.

The program then calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained. If b is less than or equal to a, the maximum profit is simply the product of the number of buns and the usual price. If b is greater than a, the maximum profit is calculated as the sum of the profit from selling k buns at the modified price and the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.

The profit from selling k buns at the modified price is calculated as the average of the first and last prices of the modified price range, multiplied by the number of buns sold at the modified price. This is because the prices of the buns sold at the modified price form an arithmetic sequence, and the sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated as the average of the first and last terms, multiplied by the number of terms.

The program then prints the maximum profit for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
