Reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, it sorts the integers in ascending order and calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, until the middle of the list is reached. The calculated sum is then printed to standard output.
