Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. It first sorts the array in ascending order, then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When the array has an even number of elements, the program correctly calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
* When the array has an odd number of elements, the program correctly calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, and ignoring the middle element.
* When all elements in the array are the same, the program correctly returns 0 as the beauty.
* When the array has only two elements, the program correctly returns the difference between the two elements as the beauty.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the elements of the array, and printing the maximum beauty for each test case.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
