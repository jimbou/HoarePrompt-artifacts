Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string. The penalty is then calculated as the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. By counting the '+' and '-' characters, the program effectively calculates the sum of the array, and then takes the absolute value of this sum to get the penalty. The program also handles the case where the input string is empty, in which case the penalty is 0. 

The program does not need to explicitly split the array into subarrays because the penalty is calculated based on the sum of the entire array, not on the sums of individual subarrays. Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
