Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, which represents the sum of the array. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of the subarrays is minimized. This can be achieved by using a dynamic programming approach or by using a greedy algorithm.

However, the given program does not implement any of these approaches. It simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not related to the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
