Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string, which is equivalent to the sum of the array. However, this is not the minimum possible penalty.

The minimum possible penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays of length 1, where each subarray contains either a '+' or a '-' character. In this case, the penalty for each subarray is 1, and the total penalty is the sum of the penalties of all subarrays.

However, the program does not calculate the penalty for each subarray, it simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters. This is not the correct solution to the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
