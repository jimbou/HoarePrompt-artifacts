Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and then printing the difference between the counts. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be achieved by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays or calculate the penalty for each subarray. It simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints the difference, which is not relevant to the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
