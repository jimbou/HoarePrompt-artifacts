Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
3. It initializes two variables `P` and `M` to 0, which will be used to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.
4. It then iterates over each character `q` in the string `s`. If `q` is '+', it increments `P` by 1, and if `q` is '-', it increments `M` by 1.
5. Finally, it prints the difference between `P` and `M`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The reasoning behind this solution is as follows:

* The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
* Since the array can only contain '+' and '-' characters, the sum of the array will be the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters.
* Therefore, the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is 0, which means the number of '+' characters equals the number of '-' characters.
* In this case, the penalty of each subarray is 0, and the total penalty is the sum of the penalties of all subarrays, which is also 0.
* If the number of '+' characters is not equal to the number of '-' characters, the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to 0 as possible.
* In this case, the penalty of each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the total penalty is the sum of the penalties of all subarrays.

The given program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and printing their difference.
