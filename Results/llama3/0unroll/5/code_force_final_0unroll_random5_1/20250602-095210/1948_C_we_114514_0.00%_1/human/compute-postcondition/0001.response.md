Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>' characters, such that `n` is an even integer and 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the second row is reachable from the first row for each test case.
