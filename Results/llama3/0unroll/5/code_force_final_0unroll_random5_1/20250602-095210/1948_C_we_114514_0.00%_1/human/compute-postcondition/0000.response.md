Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>' characters, such that `n` is an even integer and 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. A new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list. This list is likely intended to store the results of processing the test cases, but since the code snippet only initializes the list, it remains empty.
