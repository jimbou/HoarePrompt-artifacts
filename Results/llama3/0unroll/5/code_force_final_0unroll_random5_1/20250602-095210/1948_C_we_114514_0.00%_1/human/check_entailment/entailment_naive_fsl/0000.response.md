Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the rules of the robot's movement. According to the problem description, the robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then moves along the arrow in the current cell. However, the program only checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by moving right from the first row or moving down from the first row and then moving right from the second row. It does not consider the case where the robot moves up from the second row or moves left from either row.

For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
><>>

The program will output "NO", but the robot can actually reach the cell (2, 4) by moving up from the second row. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
