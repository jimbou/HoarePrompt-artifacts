    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>' characters, such that `n` is an even integer and 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second row for each test case.

    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second row for each test case, where each test case is a list containing an even integer n and two strings of length n, consisting of '<' and '>' characters, such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the reachability of the end of the second row for each test case in a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an even integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings indicating the reachability for each test case.
