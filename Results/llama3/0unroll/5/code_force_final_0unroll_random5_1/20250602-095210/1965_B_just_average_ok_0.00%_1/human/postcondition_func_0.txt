This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of 24 elements containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, then modifies the list by removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k, and appending three new elements: k minus the removed power of 2, k plus 1, and k plus the removed power of 2 plus 1. The function then prints the length of the modified list and its elements for each test case.
