Output State: **The output state will contain the length of the list "nums" and the elements of the list "nums" for each test case. The list "nums" will contain 24 elements, which are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23, and three additional elements: k - 2^idx, k + 1, and k + 2^idx + 1, where idx is the largest index such that 2^idx is less than or equal to k. The element 2^idx will be removed from the list.**
