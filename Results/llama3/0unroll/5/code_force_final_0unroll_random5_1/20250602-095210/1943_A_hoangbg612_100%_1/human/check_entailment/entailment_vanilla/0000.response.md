Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game between Alice and Bob, where the score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array c. The program takes the number of test cases T as input, and for each test case, it takes the size of the array n and the array a as input.

The program first sorts the array a in ascending order. It then initializes a variable cur to -1, which will be used to keep track of the current MEX value. It also initializes a dictionary M to store the count of each number in the array a.

The program then iterates over the sorted array a. If the current number is greater than cur, it checks if the current number is greater than cur + 1. If it is, it increments cur by 1 and breaks the loop. If the current number is not greater than cur + 1, it sets cur to the current number and increments the count of cur in the dictionary M.

If the sum of the counts of all numbers in the dictionary M is equal to the size of the array n, it increments cur by 1.

The program then creates a list cnt to store the numbers in the dictionary M that have a count of 1. If the length of cnt is greater than or equal to 2, it sets cur to the second number in cnt.

Finally, the program prints the value of cur, which is the final score of the game.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize the score. The program correctly identifies the MEX value of the array c and prints it as the final score.

Correctness: **True**
