Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the number of test cases T, where each test case contains a single integer representing the maximum value that can be obtained by incrementing the elements in the array N, without exceeding the maximum value in N, and ensuring that the total count of elements in N is equal to the length of N. If there are multiple such maximum values, the second smallest one is chosen.**
