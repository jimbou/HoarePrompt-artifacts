The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n`, the input for `T` is the number of test cases.

Output State: **`T` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**
