Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then processes each test case by sorting the integers, identifying the maximum value that can be obtained by incrementing elements without exceeding the maximum value, and ensuring the total count of elements equals the length of the input array. If multiple such maximum values exist, it selects the second smallest one. The function outputs the maximum value for each test case.**
