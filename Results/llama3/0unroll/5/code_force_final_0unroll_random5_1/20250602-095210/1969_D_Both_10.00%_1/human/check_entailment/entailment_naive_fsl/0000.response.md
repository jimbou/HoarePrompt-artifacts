Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally. The function `func_3` does not correctly calculate the profit, as it simply sums up the values of `val_a[0]` and `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` without considering the conditions under which Bob takes items for free or buys them from Alice.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the items based on the difference between `b_i` and `a_i`, and then calculating the profit based on the number of items Alice buys and the number of items Bob takes for free or buys from Alice.

For example, if the input is `n = 3`, `k = 1`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`, and `b = [4, 5, 6]`, the program would incorrectly calculate the profit as `4 + 5 + 6 - (1 + 2 + 3) = 9`, whereas the correct profit would be `5 + 6 - (1 + 2) = 8`, since Bob would take the item with `a_i = 1` for free and buy the items with `a_i = 2` and `a_i = 3` from Alice.
