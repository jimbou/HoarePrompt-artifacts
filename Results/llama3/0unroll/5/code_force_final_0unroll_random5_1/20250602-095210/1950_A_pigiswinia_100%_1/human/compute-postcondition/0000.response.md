Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `t`.

From the initial state, we know that stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).

When `t` is read from stdin, it is converted to an integer using the `int()` function and assigned to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

The stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9)**
