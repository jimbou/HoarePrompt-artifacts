Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. It then checks the conditions for a stair and a peak using simple conditional statements:
	* `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair.
	* `elif a < b > c:` checks if the digits form a peak.
	* `else:` handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.
4. The program prints the classification for each set of digits on a new line, resulting in a total of `t` lines of output.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, classifying each set of digits into one of the three categories: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'.

Correctness: **True**
