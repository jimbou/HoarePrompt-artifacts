Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads the first line from stdin, which contains a positive integer `t`.
	* `int()` converts this input to an integer.
	* The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Since `t` is a positive integer, we know that the remaining lines in stdin are `t+2t` lines, which can be simplified to `3t` lines.

The first line has been read, so the remaining lines in stdin are `3t-1` lines.

The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains `3t-1` lines, where each of the following `t` blocks of two lines contains one positive integer `n` and then `n` non-negative integers, respectively.**
