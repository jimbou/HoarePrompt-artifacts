Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the way it calculates the combinations. 

The program correctly calculates the combinations when there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, and when there are at least 2 sticks of the same length and other sticks of different lengths. However, it does not correctly calculate the combinations when there are 3 sticks of different lengths.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3], the program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, because we can choose the 3 sticks of lengths 2, 4, and 8 to form a triangle.

To fix this issue, the program needs to add another condition to calculate the combinations when there are 3 sticks of different lengths. This can be done by adding a nested loop to iterate over the different lengths and calculate the combinations.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        res = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        # Add this loop to calculate combinations when there are 3 sticks of different lengths
        lens = list(num_of_lens.keys())
        for i in range(len(lens)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(lens)):
                for k in range(j+1, len(lens)):
                    res += num_of_lens[lens[i]] * num_of_lens[lens[j]] * num_of_lens[lens[k]]
        print(res)
```

This corrected code will correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.
