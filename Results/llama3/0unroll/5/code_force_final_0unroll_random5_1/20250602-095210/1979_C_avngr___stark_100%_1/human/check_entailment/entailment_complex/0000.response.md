Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, and `func_2` applies a cumulative operation to a list of non-negative integers, effectively reducing the list to a single value.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`, and then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct. It correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers, calculates the bets for each outcome, and checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If the sum is not less than the LCM, it correctly prints -1.

Correctness: **True**
