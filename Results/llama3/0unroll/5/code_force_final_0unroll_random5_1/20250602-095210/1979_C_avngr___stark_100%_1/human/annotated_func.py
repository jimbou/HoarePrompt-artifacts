#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of two positive integers a and b, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers a and b, which is the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where each integer is a non-negative integer.
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `result` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to the first integer in the list `numbers` and the second integer in the list `numbers`, then applying `func_1` to the result and the third integer in the list `numbers`, and so on, until all integers in the list `numbers` have been processed.
    return result
    #The program returns the result of applying the function `func_1` to all integers in the list `numbers` in a cumulative manner, starting from the first integer and progressively incorporating each subsequent integer in the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:Applies a cumulative operation to a list of non-negative integers. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns the result of iteratively applying a given function (`func_1`) to the first integer and each subsequent integer in the list, effectively reducing the list to a single value.
