Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, and `func_2` calculates the LCM of all numbers in a list.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`, and then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of the LCM to calculate the bets ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
