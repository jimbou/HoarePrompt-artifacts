Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome, but the program does not provide a solution for this problem. It only defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the least common multiple of two numbers and the least common multiple of a list of numbers, respectively. However, these functions are not used to solve the problem.

A correct solution would involve calculating the minimum amount of coins that need to be bet on each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet is less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program does not provide this calculation.

For example, if the input is `3` and the multipliers are `3 2 7`, the program should output `27 41 12`, but it does not. Instead, it does not provide any output.
