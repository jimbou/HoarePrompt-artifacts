Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers, and `func_2` applies a cumulative operation to a list of non-negative integers.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`, and then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program is correct. The use of `func_1` to calculate the LCM and `func_2` to apply the cumulative operation is consistent with the problem description. The main part of the program correctly calculates the bets and checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The problem statement requires that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, but it does not check if the sum is strictly less than the LCM.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the sum of the bets is strictly less than the LCM, rather than greater than or equal to the LCM. This can be done by changing the condition in the if statement to `if sum(c) >= m - 1:`.

Correctness: **False**
