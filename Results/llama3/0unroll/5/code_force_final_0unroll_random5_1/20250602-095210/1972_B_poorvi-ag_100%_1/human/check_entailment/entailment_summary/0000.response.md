Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of 'U' (up-facing coins) in the input string. If the count of 'U' is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. The program reads multiple test cases, processes each case, and prints the result accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
