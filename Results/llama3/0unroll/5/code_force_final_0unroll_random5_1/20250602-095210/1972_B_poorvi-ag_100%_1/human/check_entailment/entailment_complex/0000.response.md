Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem statement asks to determine who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win. The key observation here is that the game is won by the player who makes the last move, which is the player who has an odd number of 'U's in the string.

The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U's in the string and checking if it's odd or even. If it's odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. The program then outputs 'yes' if Alice will win and 'no' if Bob will win.

The program also correctly handles the input and output format, reading multiple test cases from standard input and printing the results, one per line, until standard input is empty.

Correctness: **True**
