Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines whether the count of 'U' in each string is odd or even and outputs 'yes' if it's odd and 'no' if it's even. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, one per line, until standard input is empty.**
