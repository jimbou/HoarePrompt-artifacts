Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of integer pairs from standard input and prints a sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' to the console, where 'Bob' is printed for pairs with even sums and 'Alice' is printed for pairs with odd sums. The number of output lines equals the initial input integer `t`, and the input state remains unchanged.**
