Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of two steps: choosing to exchange wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The key insight here is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

The annotated program correctly implements this insight by checking the parity of the sum of the two integers `a` and `b`. If the sum is even, Bob wins, and if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This is because the total number of coins is even if and only if the sum of the two integers is even.

The program correctly reads the input, splits each line into two integers, and checks the parity of the sum. The output is also correct, printing "Bob" for even sums and "Alice" for odd sums.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
