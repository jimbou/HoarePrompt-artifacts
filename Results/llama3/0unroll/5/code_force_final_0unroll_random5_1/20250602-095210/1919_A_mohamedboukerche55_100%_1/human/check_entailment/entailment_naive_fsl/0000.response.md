Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of coins in both Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight here is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the total number of coins.

If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win because Alice will always be forced to make a move that leaves an odd number of coins, which Bob can then reduce to zero. On the other hand, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins, which Bob cannot reduce to zero.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of Alice's and Bob's coins and printing "Bob" if it's even and "Alice" if it's odd. Therefore, the program is correct for all possible inputs.
