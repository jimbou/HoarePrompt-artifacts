Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of two steps: choosing to exchange wallets with the opponent or keeping the current wallet, and removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing the second step.

The given program determines the winner of the game by checking if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, the program prints 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game can be viewed as a sequence of moves, where each move consists of removing 1 coin from the current wallet. Since the sum of the coins in both wallets is constant throughout the game, the parity of the sum (even or odd) determines the winner.

If the sum is even, Alice will always be the one to make the last move, because she will always have an even number of coins in her wallet. Since she cannot make a valid move on her turn (she cannot remove a coin from an empty wallet), Bob wins.

If the sum is odd, Bob will always be the one to make the last move, because he will always have an odd number of coins in his wallet. Since he cannot make a valid move on his turn (he cannot remove a coin from an empty wallet), Alice wins.

Therefore, the given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
