Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input (stdin) and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).

Since `t` is read from stdin, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` lines, each with two integers `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
