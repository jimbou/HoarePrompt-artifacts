Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which happens when the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd. This is because the player who makes the last move will have an odd number of coins in their wallet, and the other player will have an even number of coins in their wallet.

The program correctly checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd using the expression `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win the game. If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win the game.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing 'Bob' for pairs with even sums and 'Alice' for pairs with odd sums.

Correctness: **True**
