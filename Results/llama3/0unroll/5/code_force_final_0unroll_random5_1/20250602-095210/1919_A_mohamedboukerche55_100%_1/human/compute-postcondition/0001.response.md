Output State: **The output state will be a sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' printed to the console, where 'Bob' is printed if the sum of the two integers on a line is even, and 'Alice' is printed if the sum is odd. The number of lines in the output will be equal to the value of `t`. The value of `t` and the contents of stdin will remain unchanged.**
