Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads two integers n and k. It prints 1 if k is greater than or equal to n-1, otherwise it prints n. The function does not modify the input values and does not return any value, only printing the results for each test case.**
