stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2), representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, respectively.
