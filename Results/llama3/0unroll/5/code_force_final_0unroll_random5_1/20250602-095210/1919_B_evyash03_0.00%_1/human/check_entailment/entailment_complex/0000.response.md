Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is either positive or negative, and then calculating the penalty for each subarray.

The function `func_1` iterates over the string `expression` and maintains a balance of the number of '+' and '-' characters encountered so far. Whenever the balance goes below 0, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the final balance is positive, or the count if the final balance is not positive.

This approach is correct because it ensures that each subarray has a sum that is either positive or negative, and the penalty for each subarray is calculated correctly. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, which is efficient.

Correctness: **True**
