Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "+-+-+", the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 4. The program is not correctly calculating the minimum possible penalty.

The issue with the program is that it is not correctly splitting the string into subarrays. The program is splitting the string at each '-' character, but this is not the optimal way to split the string. The program should split the string at each '+' character that is followed by a '-' character, and at each '-' character that is followed by a '+' character. This is because the penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and splitting the string at these points will result in subarrays with a sum of 0, which will result in a penalty of 0.

For example, if the input string is "+-+-+", the program should split it into the subarrays ["+-", "+-", "+-"], which will result in a penalty of 4. But the program is splitting it into the subarrays ["+", "-", "+", "-", "+", "-"], which will result in a penalty of 0.

Therefore, the program is not correct and the Correctness is **False**.
