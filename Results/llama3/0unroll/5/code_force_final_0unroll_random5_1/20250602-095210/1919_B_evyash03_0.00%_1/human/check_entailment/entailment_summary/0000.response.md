Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays with non-negative sums. The function `func_1` iterates over the string `expression` and maintains a balance variable to keep track of the sum of the subarray. Whenever the balance goes below 0, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the final balance is positive, which means there is one more subarray with a positive sum.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input string consists only of '+' or '-' characters, or when the string has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the output matches the expected results for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
