This function calculates the total number of times the balance goes below 0 during a loop that iterates over a string of '+' and '-' characters, and returns this count plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise returns the count. The function takes a string expression and its length as input, but only uses the expression. The input string remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state.
