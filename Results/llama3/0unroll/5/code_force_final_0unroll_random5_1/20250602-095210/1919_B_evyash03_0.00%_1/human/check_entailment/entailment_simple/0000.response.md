Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by iterating through the string `expression` and keeping track of the balance between '+' and '-' characters. Whenever the balance goes below 0, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. Finally, it returns the count plus 1 if the final balance is positive, or the count if the final balance is not positive.

The reason for this is that the optimal way to split the array `a` is to split it whenever the balance goes below 0, because this ensures that the sum of each subarray is either 0 or positive. The penalty for each subarray is then the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, which is minimized when the sum is 0. By counting the number of times the balance goes below 0, the program effectively counts the number of subarrays with a sum of 0, and by adding 1 if the final balance is positive, it accounts for the last subarray which may have a positive sum.

The main program correctly reads the input, splits the string into parts separated by '-', calculates the length of the result, and calls the function `func_1` with the correct arguments.

Correctness: **True**
