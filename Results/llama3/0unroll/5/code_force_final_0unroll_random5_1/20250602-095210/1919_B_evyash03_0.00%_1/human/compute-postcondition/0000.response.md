Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a non-negative integer equal to the length of expression, count is 0, balance is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `count` and `balance`, and assigns them the value 0. The initial state of `expression` and `length` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The final state includes the original state of `expression` and `length`, as well as the new values of `count` and `balance`.
