#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a non-negative integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop has finished executing will have the same expression and length as the initial state, but the count will be the number of times the balance went below 0 during the loop, and the balance will be the final balance after all iterations, which will be the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the expression.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the total number of times the balance went below 0 during the loop, plus 1 if the final balance is positive, or the total number of times the balance went below 0 during the loop if the final balance is not positive.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the total number of times the balance goes below 0 during a loop that iterates over a string of '+' and '-' characters, and returns this count plus 1 if the final balance is positive, otherwise returns the count. The function takes a string expression and its length as input, but only uses the expression. The input string remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state.
