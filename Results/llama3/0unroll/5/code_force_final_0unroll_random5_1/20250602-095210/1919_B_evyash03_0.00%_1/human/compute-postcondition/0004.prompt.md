You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a non-negative integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop has finished executing will have the same expression and length as the initial state, but the count will be the number of times the balance went below 0 during the loop, and the balance will be the final balance after all iterations, which will be the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the expression.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the total number of times the balance went below 0 during the loop, plus 1 if the final balance is positive, or the total number of times the balance went below 0 during the loop if the final balance is not positive.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of times the balance went below 0 during the loop, plus 1 if the final balance is positive, or the total number of times the balance went below 0 during the loop if the final balance is not positive.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
