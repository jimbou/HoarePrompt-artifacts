Functionality: **This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input and returns a new string containing the characters from the input string, reordered by their depth in the parentheses sequence. The function first calculates the depth of each position in the input string, then sorts these positions by depth and finally constructs the output string by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions. The function does not modify the input string or any other external state, and its output only depends on the input string.**
