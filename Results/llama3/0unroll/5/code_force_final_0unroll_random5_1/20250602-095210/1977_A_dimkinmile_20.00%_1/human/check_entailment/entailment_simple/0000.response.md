Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program reads the number of test cases (kreker) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

The program then checks if n is greater than or equal to m. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The reasoning behind this logic is that if n is greater than or equal to m, Nikita can always build a tower with exactly m cubes by putting m cubes on top of the tower and then removing n-m cubes from the top. This is because the number of moves (n) is sufficient to add and remove the required number of cubes to reach the desired height (m).

However, if n is less than m, it's impossible to build a tower with exactly m cubes, because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves available.

Therefore, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
