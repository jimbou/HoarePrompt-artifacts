Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, `n` is between 1 and 100, `m` is between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 lines of input where t is an integer between 1 and 100.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to be integers between 1 and 100, as they were assigned the values from the first line of input. The stdin now contains t-1 lines of input, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of t is still between 1 and 100, as it was not modified by the code.
