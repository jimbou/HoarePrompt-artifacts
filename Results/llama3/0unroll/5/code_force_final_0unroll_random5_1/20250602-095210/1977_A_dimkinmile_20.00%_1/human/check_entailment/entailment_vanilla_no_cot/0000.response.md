Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it doesn't check if the difference between n and m is even. If the difference is odd, it's impossible to end up with m cubes after n moves. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
