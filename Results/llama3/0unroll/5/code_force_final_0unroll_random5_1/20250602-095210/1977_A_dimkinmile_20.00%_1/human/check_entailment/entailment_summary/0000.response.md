Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the tower. The given program checks if n is greater than or equal to m, and if so, prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build the tower.

However, this approach is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the parity of n and m. If n is odd, Nikita can end up with any odd number of cubes (1, 3, 5, ...). If n is even, Nikita can end up with any even number of cubes (0, 2, 4, ...). Therefore, the program should check if the parity of n and m is the same.

Correctness: **False**
