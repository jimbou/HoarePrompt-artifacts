Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The given program checks if n is greater than or equal to m, and if so, prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build the tower.

However, this approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to check if the difference between n and m is even. This is because the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1 in each move, so if the difference between n and m is odd, it's impossible to build the tower.

For example, if n = 3 and m = 2, the program will print 'Yes', but it's actually impossible to build a tower with 2 cubes after 3 moves.

Correctness: **False**
