Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n is odd and m is even, the program will print 'Yes' even though it's not possible to end up with an even number of cubes after an odd number of moves. 

In the given code, the function func_1() is called before it is defined. This will result in a NameError because Python doesn't know what func_1() is yet. The function definition should be placed before the for loop that calls it.

Also, the condition in the if statement is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with m cubes after n moves. The correct condition should be that n should be greater than or equal to m and (n - m) should be even. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
kreker = int(input())
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()
```
