Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by defining a function `func_1()` that takes two integers `n` and `m` as input. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, the program has a logical flaw. The condition `n >= m` is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The correct condition should be `n >= m && (n - m) % 2 == 0`, which checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because Nikita can only add or remove cubes in pairs (one cube at a time), so the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even.

Additionally, the program calls `func_1()` in a loop `kreker` times, but `kreker` is not defined anywhere in the program. It seems that `kreker` should be the number of test cases, but it's not clear how it's supposed to be initialized.

Correctness: **False**
