Output State: **`T` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is the number of sides of a polygon, x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen (y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

In this output state, the value of `T` is an integer that was read from the input, and the remaining test cases are still in the stdin. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing three integers (n, x, and y) and the second line containing x distinct integers from 1 to n.
