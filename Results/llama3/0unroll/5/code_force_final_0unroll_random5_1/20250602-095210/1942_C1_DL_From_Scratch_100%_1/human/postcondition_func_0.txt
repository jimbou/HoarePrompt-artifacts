This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a polygon with a specified number of sides and vertices chosen by Bessie. It calculates and prints the total number of vertices that can be chosen by Bessie in each test case, considering the vertices that are one unit away from each other and the vertices Bessie has already chosen, minus 2. The output is a list of integers, each representing the number of vertices that can be chosen in each test case.
