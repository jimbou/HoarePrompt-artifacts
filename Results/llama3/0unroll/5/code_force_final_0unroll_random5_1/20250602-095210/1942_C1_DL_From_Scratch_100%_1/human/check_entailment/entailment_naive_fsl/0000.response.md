Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The program first sorts the list of chosen vertices and then iterates through the list to count the number of triangular pieces that can be formed. The program also handles the case where the first and last vertices are connected by a diagonal.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. The program does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Note: The program assumes that the input is valid and does not contain any errors. If the input is invalid, the program may not work correctly. However, based on the problem description, it is assumed that the input is valid.
