Output State: **The output state will be the number of vertices that can be chosen by Bessie in each test case, which is the sum of the count of vertices that are one unit away from each other and the number of vertices Bessie has already chosen minus 2. The output will be in the format of a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of vertices that can be chosen in each test case.**
