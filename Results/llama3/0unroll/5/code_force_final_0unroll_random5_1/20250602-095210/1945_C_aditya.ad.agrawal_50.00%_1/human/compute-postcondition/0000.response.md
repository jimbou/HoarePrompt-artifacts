Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer because it is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the standard input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one because one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The other test cases remain in the stdin, each containing two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.
