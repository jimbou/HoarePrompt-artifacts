Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position in the string where the number of 1s on the right is greater than or equal to half of the remaining characters, and the number of 0s on the left is greater than or equal to half of the characters on the left. The program also correctly handles the case where no such position exists and prints 0 in that case. The program also correctly repeats this process for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
