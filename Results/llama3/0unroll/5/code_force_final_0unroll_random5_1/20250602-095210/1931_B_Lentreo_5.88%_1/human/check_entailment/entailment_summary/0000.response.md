Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero number and the last number in the list, and prints 'YES' if the sum is zero, otherwise 'NO'. However, this approach is not correct.

The problem statement requires that the amount of water in all containers can be made the same using the described operation. The operation allows pouring any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j.

The program's approach does not consider the order of the containers and the fact that water can only be poured from a container to a container with a higher index. It simply calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero number and the last number in the list, which is not sufficient to determine if the amount of water in all containers can be made the same.

For example, consider the input [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]. The program will calculate the sum of differences as (4-3) + (5-3) + (2-3) + (1-3) = 2, which is not zero. However, it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the first container to the fourth, then from the second container to the third, and finally from the second container to the fourth.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
