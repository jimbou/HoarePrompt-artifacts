Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program calculates the difference between each non-zero number and the last number in the list, and checks if the sum of these differences is zero. If the sum is zero, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, and the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the differences is zero, which means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. It also correctly handles the case where the sum of the differences is not zero, which means that it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
