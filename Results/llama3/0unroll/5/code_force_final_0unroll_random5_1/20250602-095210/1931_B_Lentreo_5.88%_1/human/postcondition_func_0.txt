This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case. It calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero number and the last number in the list, and prints 'YES' if the sum is zero, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values and only outputs the result for each test case.
