The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, followed by `t` test cases. After accepting `t`, the stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.**
