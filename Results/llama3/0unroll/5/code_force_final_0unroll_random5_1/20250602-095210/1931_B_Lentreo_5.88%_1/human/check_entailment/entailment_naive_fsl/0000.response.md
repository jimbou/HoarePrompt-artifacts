Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The program only checks if the sum of the differences between each container's amount and the last container's amount is zero. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to make the amounts the same.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "NO", but it's actually possible to make the amounts the same by pouring water from the second container to the first and third containers.

A correct solution would involve checking if the prefix sum of the array is always greater than or equal to the average amount of water, which is the total sum divided by the number of containers. If the prefix sum is always greater than or equal to the average, then it's possible to make the amounts the same by pouring water from the current container to the next containers.
