Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= 10^7). num is an integer, out is an empty list.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `num`. Since stdin initially contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by `t` test cases, after this line executes, stdin will contain `t-1` test cases. The second line initializes an empty list and assigns it to the variable `out`.
