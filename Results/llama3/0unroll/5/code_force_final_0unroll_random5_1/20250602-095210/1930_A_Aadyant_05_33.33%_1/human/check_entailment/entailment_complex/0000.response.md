Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing a series of moves on a set of integers written on a whiteboard. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It then sorts the integers in each test case, selects the smallest n integers, calculates their sum, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum in the list.

The program's logic is correct because it follows the optimal strategy for achieving the maximum final score. By sorting the integers and selecting the smallest n integers, the program ensures that it is always choosing the minimum value between two integers, which is the key to maximizing the final score.

The program's implementation is also correct. It uses a list to store the sums of the smallest n integers from each test case, and it prints each sum in the list. The use of the `split()` function to split the input string into a list of integers is correct, and the use of the `sort()` function to sort the list of integers is also correct.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
