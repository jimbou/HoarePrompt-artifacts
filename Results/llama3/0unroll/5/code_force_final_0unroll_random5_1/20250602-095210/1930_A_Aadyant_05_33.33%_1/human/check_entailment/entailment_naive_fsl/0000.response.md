Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of integers written on the whiteboard (2n) and the integers themselves.
2. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the minimum of each pair.
3. It then iterates over the sorted list, selecting the minimum of each pair (i.e., the first element of each pair) and adds it to the score.
4. The program repeats this process for each test case and prints the maximum final score for each case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the number of integers is odd (2n+1), the program still works correctly because it only considers pairs of integers.
* When the integers are all the same, the program still works correctly because it selects the minimum of each pair, which is the same integer.
* When the integers are in any order, the program still works correctly because it sorts the integers before selecting the minimum of each pair.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
