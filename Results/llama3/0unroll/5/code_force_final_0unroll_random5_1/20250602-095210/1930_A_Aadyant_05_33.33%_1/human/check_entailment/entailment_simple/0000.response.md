Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on a set of 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The program reads the input from stdin, which contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).

The program correctly reads the input, sorts the 2n integers in ascending order, and then selects the smallest n integers to calculate the maximum final score. The program appends the sum of these smallest n integers to the list "out" for each test case.

Finally, the program prints the maximum final score for each test case by iterating over the list "out".

Correctness: **True**
