The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It then sorts the integers in each test case, selects the smallest n integers, calculates their sum, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum in the list. The function does not modify the input values or store any results beyond printing the sums.
