Functionality: **This function takes two lists, 'a' and 'b', as input. It then returns a tuple containing two values. The first value is the sum of the first element of list 'a' and the first element of list 'b'. The second value is the sum of the second element of list 'a' and the second element of list 'b'. The function assumes that the first element of list 'a' is an integer, the first element of list 'b' is a string, the second element of list 'a' is an integer, and the second element of list 'b' is a string. The function does not modify the original lists.**
