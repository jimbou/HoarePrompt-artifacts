Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program works by first calculating the product of all the multipliers (k_i) for the outcomes. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the product of all multipliers divided by the multiplier for that outcome (vprod). The difference between the product of all multipliers and the sum of these divided products (den) is then calculated.

If den is less than or equal to 0, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, so the program prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the divided products (vprod) as the bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes (sum(vprod)) is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome (prod). This is because den is the difference between the product of all multipliers and the sum of the divided products, and if den is greater than 0, it means that the sum of the divided products is less than the product of all multipliers.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
