Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multipliers for each outcome as input, calculates the product of all multipliers, and then calculates the product of all multipliers divided by each multiplier. It then checks if the difference between the product of all multipliers and the sum of the products of all multipliers divided by each multiplier is greater than 0. If it is, the program prints the products of all multipliers divided by each multiplier as the bets for each outcome. If it is not, the program prints -1.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The key insight is that the product of all multipliers divided by each multiplier is the smallest amount that can be bet on each outcome such that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. The program correctly calculates this amount and checks if it is possible to bet this amount on each outcome. If it is not possible, the program correctly prints -1.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The program uses the `return` statement without a value, which means that the function will return `None` by default. This is not a problem in this case because the function is not supposed to return a value, but it is generally a good practice to use `return None` explicitly to make it clear that the function does not return a value.

Correctness: **True**
