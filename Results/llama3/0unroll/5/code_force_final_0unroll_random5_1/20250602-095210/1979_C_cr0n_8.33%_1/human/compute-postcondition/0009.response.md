The code prints a string of space-separated integers, where each integer is the product of all integers in the list `vals` divided by the corresponding integer in `vals`. In other words, it prints the elements of the list `vprod`.

Since `vals` is a list of `N` integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, and `vprod` is a list of `N` integers where each element is the product of all integers in `vals` divided by the corresponding integer in `vals`, the printed string will contain `N` space-separated integers.

Each integer in the printed string represents the product of all integers in `vals` divided by the corresponding integer in `vals`. For example, if `vals` is `[2, 3, 4]`, then `vprod` would be `[6, 4, 3]`, because `6` is the product of all integers in `vals` divided by `2`, `4` is the product of all integers in `vals` divided by `3`, and `3` is the product of all integers in `vals` divided by `4`.

Since `N` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, the printed string will contain between 1 and 50 space-separated integers.

Output: **a string of N space-separated integers, where each integer is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals**
