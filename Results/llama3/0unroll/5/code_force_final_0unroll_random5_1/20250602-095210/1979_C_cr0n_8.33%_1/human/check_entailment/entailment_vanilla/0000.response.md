Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game, such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (N) and the multipliers for each outcome (vals).
3. It calculates the product of all multipliers (prod) and then calculates the product of all multipliers except each individual multiplier (vprod).
4. It calculates the denominator (den) by subtracting the sum of vprod from prod.
5. If the denominator is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.
6. Otherwise, it prints the values in vprod, which represent the bets on each outcome.

The program's logic is based on the mathematical concept of the least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each number in the set. In this case, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers (prod) and then calculates the product of all multipliers except each individual multiplier (vprod). The denominator (den) is then calculated by subtracting the sum of vprod from prod.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This is achieved by distributing the coins in such a way that the sum of the bets on all outcomes is equal to the denominator (den), which is less than the LCM of the multipliers (prod).

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
