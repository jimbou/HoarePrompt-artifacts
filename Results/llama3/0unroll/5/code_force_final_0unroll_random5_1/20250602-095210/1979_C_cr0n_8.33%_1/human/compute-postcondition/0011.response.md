Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns nothing. The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer N, and the second line contains N integers. It calculates the product of these N integers and then calculates the product of all integers divided by each individual integer. If the difference between the product of all integers and the sum of these divided products is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the divided products as a string of N space-separated integers. The function does not modify the input variables and leaves the program state unchanged after execution.**
