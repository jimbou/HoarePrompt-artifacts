Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case has two lines: the first line contains an integer N, and the second line contains N integers.

2. The program calculates the product of all integers in the second line of each test case, which is used to calculate the product of all integers divided by each individual integer.

3. The program checks if the difference between the product of all integers and the sum of these divided products is less than or equal to 0. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

4. If the difference is greater than 0, the program prints the divided products as a string of N space-separated integers. This is a correct solution because the divided products represent the amount of coins that should be bet on each outcome to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

5. The program does not modify the input variables and leaves the program state unchanged after execution, which is correct.

6. The program handles all possible inputs correctly, including the case where the difference between the product of all integers and the sum of these divided products is less than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
