You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: Output State: N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod is the product of all integers in vals, stdin is empty
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with N being an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals being a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod being the product of all integers in vals, vprod being a list of N integers where each element is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals, den being an integer equal to the product of all integers in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod and less than or equal to 0, stdin being empty, and -1 being printed.
    #State: *N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod is the product of all integers in vals, vprod is a list of N integers where each element is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals, den is an integer equal to the product of all integers in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod, stdin is empty, and den is larger than 0
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: a string of N space-separated integers, where each integer is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with N being an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals being a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod being the product of all integers in vals, vprod being a list of N integers where each element is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals, den being an integer equal to the product of all integers in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod and less than or equal to 0, stdin being empty, and -1 being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
