#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: Output State: N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod is the product of all integers in vals, stdin is empty
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with N being an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals being a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod being the product of all integers in vals, vprod being a list of N integers where each element is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals, den being an integer equal to the product of all integers in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod and less than or equal to 0, stdin being empty, and -1 being printed.
    #State: *N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod is the product of all integers in vals, vprod is a list of N integers where each element is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals, den is an integer equal to the product of all integers in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod, stdin is empty, and den is larger than 0

    #This is printed: a string of N space-separated integers, where each integer is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns nothing. The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer N, and the second line contains N integers. It calculates the product of these N integers and then calculates the product of all integers divided by each individual integer. If the difference between the product of all integers and the sum of these divided products is less than or equal to 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the divided products as a string of N space-separated integers. The function does not modify the input variables and leaves the program state unchanged after execution.
