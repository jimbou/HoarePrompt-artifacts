Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program calculates the product of all the multipliers, then for each multiplier, it calculates the product of all the other multipliers. It then checks if the difference between the product of all multipliers and the sum of the products of all other multipliers is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the products of all other multipliers as the bets for each outcome. If it is not, it prints -1.

The program works correctly for all the examples provided, and it also works correctly for other potential cases. For example, if the input is 2 and the multipliers are 3 and 4, the program will calculate the product of the multipliers as 12, and the products of all other multipliers as 4 and 3. The difference between the product of all multipliers and the sum of the products of all other multipliers is 12 - (4 + 3) = 5, which is greater than 0. Therefore, the program will print 4 and 3 as the bets for each outcome.

In general, the program works correctly because it uses the correct logic to calculate the bets for each outcome. It calculates the product of all the multipliers, then for each multiplier, it calculates the product of all the other multipliers. It then checks if the difference between the product of all multipliers and the sum of the products of all other multipliers is greater than 0. If it is, it prints the products of all other multipliers as the bets for each outcome. If it is not, it prints -1. This logic is correct because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
