Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, vals is a list of N integers between 2 and 20 inclusive, prod is the product of all integers in vals, vprod is a list of N integers where each element is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals, den is an integer equal to the product of all integers in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of N, vals, and prod remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The new variable vprod is introduced, which is a list of N integers where each element is the product of all integers in vals divided by the corresponding integer in vals. The variable den is also introduced, which is an integer equal to the product of all integers in vals minus the sum of the elements in vprod. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
