Based on the precondition, the print statement will output the values of `arr` and `prefix`.

`arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, where n is an integer between 1 and 10^5. The exact values of the integers in `arr` are not specified, but they are within the given range.

`prefix` is a list of n+1 integers, where each element is the XOR of the corresponding element in `arr` and the previous element in `prefix`. This means that the first element of `prefix` is the XOR of the first element of `arr` and 0 (since there is no previous element in `prefix`), the second element of `prefix` is the XOR of the second element of `arr` and the first element of `prefix`, and so on.

Since the exact values of the integers in `arr` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact values of the elements in `prefix`. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[list of n integers between 1 and 10^9], [list of n+1 integers where each element is the XOR of the corresponding element in arr and the previous element in prefix]**
