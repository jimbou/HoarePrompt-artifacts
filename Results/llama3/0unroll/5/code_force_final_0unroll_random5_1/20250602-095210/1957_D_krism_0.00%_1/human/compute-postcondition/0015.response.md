Output State: **The value of suf[j][0] is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop where cur >> j & 1 is False, and the value of suf[j][1] is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop where cur >> j & 1 is True, and the value of pre is printed, and suf is printed, and ans is 0.**

In this output state, the value of suf[j][0] and suf[j][1] remains the same as in the initial state, because the given code does not modify these values. The value of pre and suf are printed, but their values are not changed. The only change is that a new variable ans is introduced and assigned the value 0.
