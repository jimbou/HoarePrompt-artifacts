Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, prefix is a list containing a single element, 0.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since stdin initially contains an integer t followed by t test cases, after reading one integer, stdin now contains t-1 test cases. The second line reads n integers from stdin and assigns them to arr. Since each test case contains an integer n followed by n integers, after reading n integers, stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The third line initializes a list prefix with a single element, 0. This does not affect any other variables.
