Output State: The value of suf[j][0] is decremented by the number of iterations of the loop where c >> j & 1 is False, and the value of suf[j][1] is decremented by the number of iterations of the loop where c >> j & 1 is True, and the value of pre[j][0] is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop where c >> j & 1 is False, and the value of pre[j][1] is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop where c >> j & 1 is True, and the value of ans is the sum of the products of pre[k][0] and suf[k][0] and pre[k][1] and suf[k][1] for all iterations of the loop, and the value of pre is printed, and suf is printed.
