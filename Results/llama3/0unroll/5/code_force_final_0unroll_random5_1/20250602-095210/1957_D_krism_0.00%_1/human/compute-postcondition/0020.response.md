Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. The function calculates the XOR prefix sum of the list and then iterates over the list to calculate the sum of products of corresponding elements of two lists, pre and suf, which are initialized with zeros. The function prints the sum of these products for each test case.**
