Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of tuples (x, y, z) in an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n and f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z), where f(l, r) = a_l ⊕ a_{l + 1} ⊕ ... ⊕ a_{r}.

The program first calculates the prefix XOR sum of the array, which is used to efficiently calculate the XOR of any subarray. It then initializes two lists, pre and suf, to keep track of the number of elements in the prefix and suffix of the array that have a certain bit set or unset.

The program then iterates over the array, updating the pre and suf lists and calculating the sum of products of corresponding elements of the pre and suf lists. This sum represents the number of tuples that satisfy the given conditions.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the execution summary confirms that it produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
