Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves finding a number x in a permutation p of size n using a modified binary search algorithm. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation and the number to be found, followed by the permutation itself.

The program uses a dictionary to store the indices of the numbers in the permutation, and a list to keep track of the seen numbers during the binary search. It then performs the binary search, and if the number is not found, it checks if the number has been seen before. If not, it swaps the number with the number at the left index and prints the swap operation. If the number has been seen before, it swaps the number with the number at the left index and then swaps the number at the left index with the number at the index of the seen number, printing both swap operations.

The program correctly implements the modified binary search algorithm and handles the cases where the number is found, not found but seen before, and not found and not seen before. It also correctly prints the number of operations performed and the swap operations themselves.

Correctness: **True**
