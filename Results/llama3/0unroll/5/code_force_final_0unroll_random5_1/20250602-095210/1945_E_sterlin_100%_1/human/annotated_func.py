#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer greater than 0 that was provided as input through stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer greater than 0 from standard input and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, which are the result of converting each string in the input list to an integer. The input list is a space-separated list of integers from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a line of space-separated integers
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers that were provided as space-separated input in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns them as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string
    return input()
    #The program returns the string that is currently in the standard input (stdin).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from the standard input (stdin) and returns it as is, without any modifications or transformations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a string of space-separated values of any type and value.
    return input().split()
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string in stdin. The list contains values of any type and value.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a string of space-separated values from standard input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a space-separated value from the input string.
