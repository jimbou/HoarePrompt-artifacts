Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to perform binary search on a permutation after at most 2 swaps to find the target number x. However, the provided program does not implement the binary search algorithm or the swapping operation as described in the problem description.

In fact, the program does not even attempt to solve the problem. It only defines some input functions (func_1 to func_5) but does not use them to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To make the program correct, it should implement the binary search algorithm and the swapping operation as described in the problem description. It should also use the input functions to read the input data and solve the problem accordingly.
