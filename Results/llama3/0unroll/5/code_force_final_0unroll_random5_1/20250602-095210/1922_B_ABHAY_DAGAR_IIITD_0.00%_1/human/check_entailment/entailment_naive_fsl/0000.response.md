Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. It first counts the number of sticks of each length and then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle.

The program handles the case where there are at least 3 sticks of the same length by calculating the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from that length using the combination formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.

The program also handles the case where there are at least 2 sticks of the same length and at least one stick of a different length by calculating the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from the same length and 1 stick from a different length using the formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.

The program correctly updates the `total_count` variable to keep track of the total number of sticks that have been counted so far.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
