Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2.  It iterates over each test case, reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.
3.  It creates a dictionary `num_of_lens` to store the frequency of each stick length.
4.  It calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. This is done by iterating over the values in `num_of_lens` (i.e., the frequencies of each stick length) and adding the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (if the frequency is 3 or more) and the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length (if the frequency is 2 or more).
5.  It appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
6.  Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
