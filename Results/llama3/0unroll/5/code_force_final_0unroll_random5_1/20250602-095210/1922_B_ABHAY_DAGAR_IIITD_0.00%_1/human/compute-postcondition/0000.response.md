Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of lists of integers, where the first element of each sublist is an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= n), `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the variable `test_cases` still holds its initial value, which is a list of lists of integers. Each sublist contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The variable `results` is newly introduced and is assigned an empty list.
