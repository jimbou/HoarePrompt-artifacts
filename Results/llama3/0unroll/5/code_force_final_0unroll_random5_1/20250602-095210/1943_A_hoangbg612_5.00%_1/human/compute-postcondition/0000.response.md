The code `T = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i < n), the value of `T` is equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **`T` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i < n).**
