Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of a single integer `n` followed by `n` integers.
2.  It sorts the list of integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the MEX of the array `c`.
3.  It initializes a variable `cur` to -1, which will be used to keep track of the current MEX.
4.  It creates a dictionary `M` to store the frequency of each number in the sorted list.
5.  It iterates over the sorted list, updating `cur` and `M` accordingly. If a number is greater than `cur`, it updates `cur` and sets the frequency of `cur` to 1 in `M`. If a number is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in `M`.
6.  After iterating over the entire list, it checks if the sum of frequencies in `M` is equal to `S` (the size of the input list). If it is, it increments `cur` by 1.
7.  Finally, it iterates over the range of `cur` and checks if the frequency of any number `i` is less than or equal to `i`. If it finds such a number, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
8.  It prints the final value of `cur`, which represents the maximum MEX that can be achieved by Alice.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum MEX that can be achieved by Alice, considering the optimal moves of both Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **True**
