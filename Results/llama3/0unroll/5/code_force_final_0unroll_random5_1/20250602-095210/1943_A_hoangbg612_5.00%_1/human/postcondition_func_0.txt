This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then determines the maximum number of elements that can be selected from the list such that the selected elements are in non-decreasing order and the number of selected elements is equal to the number of elements in the list. The function prints the maximum number of elements that can be selected for each test case.
