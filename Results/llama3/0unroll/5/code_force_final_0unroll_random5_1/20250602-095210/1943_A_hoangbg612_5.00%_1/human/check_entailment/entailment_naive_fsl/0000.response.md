Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize it. The key insight is that Alice should try to create a sequence where the MEX is as large as possible, while Bob tries to disrupt this by removing elements that would increase the MEX.

The program first sorts the input array `N` and then iterates through it, keeping track of the current maximum value `cur` that has been seen so far. It also keeps a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number.

The program then checks if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to the length of the input array `S`. If it is, it means that all numbers have been seen, and the MEX is one more than the current maximum value `cur`. Otherwise, the MEX is the current maximum value `cur`.

The program then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of each number in `M` is less than or equal to the number itself. If it finds such a number, it sets `cur` to that number and breaks the loop.

Finally, the program prints the value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the sequence created by Alice.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the input array is empty or contains only one element. It also correctly handles cases where the input array contains duplicate elements or elements that are not in the range [0, n-1].

Overall, the program is correct and implements the optimal strategy for the game.
