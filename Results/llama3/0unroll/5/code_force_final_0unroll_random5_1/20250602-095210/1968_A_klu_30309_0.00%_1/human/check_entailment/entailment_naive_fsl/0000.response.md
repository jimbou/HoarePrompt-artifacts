Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(x)` correctly finds the integer `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

The function iterates from `x - 1` down to `2` and checks if `x` is divisible by `y`. If it is, and `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`, it returns `y` immediately. This is because `gcd(x, y)` would be `y` in this case, and `y` is the largest possible value that satisfies the condition.

If no such `y` is found, the function returns the largest `y` that was found to have a non-zero `gcd(x, y)`. This is because `gcd(x, y)` is at least `1` for any `y`, so adding `y` to it will always result in a value greater than or equal to `y`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `x` is a prime number or `x` is less than or equal to `2`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
