Functionality: **This function reads an integer 'a' from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It calculates the side length of the square using these coordinates and prints the square of this side length. The function repeats this process 'a' times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100. The output is 'a' number of lines, each containing a single integer, which is the square of the side length of the corresponding square.**
