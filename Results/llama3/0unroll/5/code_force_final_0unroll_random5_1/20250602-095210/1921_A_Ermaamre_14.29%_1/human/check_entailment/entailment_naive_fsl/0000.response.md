Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39

The program will output:

9
4
784

However, the correct output should be:

9
4
784

But if we change the input to:

3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 1

The program will output:

0

But the correct output should be:

0 is not a valid output because the area of a square cannot be 0.

The problem with the program is that it only checks for three specific cases where the x-coordinates of two points are equal, but it does not handle the case where all four points have the same x-coordinate. In this case, the program will not be able to calculate the area of the square correctly.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to handle all possible cases, including the case where all four points have the same x-coordinate.
