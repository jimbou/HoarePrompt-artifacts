Output State: The loop will execute 'a' times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100. In each iteration, it will read four lines of input from stdin, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The loop will calculate the area of each square and print it. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that 'a' test cases will have been processed and their corresponding square areas will have been printed.
