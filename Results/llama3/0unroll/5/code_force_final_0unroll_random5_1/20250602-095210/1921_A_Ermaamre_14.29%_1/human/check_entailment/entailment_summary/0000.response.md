Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the corners of the square. It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the y-coordinates of two points that share the same x-coordinate. The program then prints the square of this side length, which represents the area of the square.

The program handles three possible cases for the arrangement of the corners:

1.  When the first and third points have the same x-coordinate, and the second and fourth points have the same x-coordinate.
2.  When the first and second points have the same x-coordinate, and the third and fourth points have the same x-coordinate.
3.  When the first and fourth points have the same x-coordinate, and the second and third points have the same x-coordinate.

In each case, the program calculates the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the two points that share the same x-coordinate to find the side length of the square.

The program repeats this process for the specified number of test cases and prints the area of each square.

Correctness: **True**
