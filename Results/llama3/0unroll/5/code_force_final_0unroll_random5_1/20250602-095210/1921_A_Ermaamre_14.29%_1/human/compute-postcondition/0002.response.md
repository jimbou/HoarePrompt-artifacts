Output State: **The loop will execute 'a' number of times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100. In each iteration, it will read four lines of input from stdin, each containing two integers. It will then calculate the side length of a square using the coordinates of its corners and print the square of this side length. The output will be 'a' number of lines, each containing a single integer, which is the square of the side length of the corresponding square. The value of 'a' remains unchanged.**
