Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 testcases. Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of the square.**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 100. The remaining input in stdin consists of `t-1` testcases, each containing four lines with two integers per line, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
