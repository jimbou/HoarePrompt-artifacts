Postcondition: **The list c contains all the elements of list a, but for each element greater than 10, it is replaced by either the element itself or its digits, depending on the value of the digits. The variable n is equal to the length of list c. The values of k, x, and y are unchanged. The variable d is assigned the sorted list c. The current value of c is equal to the current value of d, meaning that list c is sorted.**
