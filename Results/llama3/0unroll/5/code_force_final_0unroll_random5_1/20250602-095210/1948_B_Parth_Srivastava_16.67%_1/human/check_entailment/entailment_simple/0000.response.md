Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and stores it in the list `a`.
2. It then iterates over the list `a` and checks if each element is greater than 10. If it is, it splits the element into its digits and checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order. If they are, it replaces the original element with its digits in the list `c`. If not, it leaves the original element as it is in the list `c`.
3. After processing all elements in the list `a`, the program checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. If they are the same, it means the list `c` is sorted, and the program appends 1 to the list `b`. Otherwise, it appends 0 to the list `b`.
4. Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in the list `b` is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
