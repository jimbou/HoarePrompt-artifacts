Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement, which is to take any element of the array that is at least 10, delete it, and instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in order they appear in that element. The program then checks if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program uses a list `c` to store the modified array, and it correctly handles the cases where the element is greater than 10 and where it is not. It also correctly checks if the resulting array is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the element is 10 or when the array has only one element.

The only potential issue with the program is that it uses a global variable `b` to store the results, which is not necessary and could be avoided by returning the result from the function instead of appending it to a global list. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
