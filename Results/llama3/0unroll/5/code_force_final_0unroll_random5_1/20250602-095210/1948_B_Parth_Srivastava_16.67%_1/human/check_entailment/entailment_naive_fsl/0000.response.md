Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input array has less than 2 elements. In the problem description, it is stated that the array has a length of n, but it does not specify that n must be greater than or equal to 2. However, the program assumes that n is always greater than or equal to 2, as it uses the index i-1 in the loop. If n is less than 2, this will result in an IndexError.

For example, if the input is:

1
[5]

The program will raise an IndexError when trying to access c[n-1] because n is 1 and there is no element at index -1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle this edge case.
