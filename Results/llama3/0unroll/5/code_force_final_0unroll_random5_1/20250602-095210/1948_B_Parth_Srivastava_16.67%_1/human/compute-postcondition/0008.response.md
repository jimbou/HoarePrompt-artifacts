Postcondition: ***The list c contains all the elements of list a, but for each element greater than 10, it is replaced by either the element itself or its digits, depending on the value of the digits. The variable n is equal to the length of list c. The values of k, x, and y are unchanged. The variable d is assigned the sorted list c. If list c is sorted, then the list b has been appended with the value 1. Otherwise, list c is not sorted and the list b has an additional element, 0, appended to it.***
