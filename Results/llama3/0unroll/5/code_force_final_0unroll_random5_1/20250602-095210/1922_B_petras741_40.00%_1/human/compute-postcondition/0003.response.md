Functionality: **This function reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates and prints the number of unique triplets that can be formed from the given integers. If a test case has less than 3 integers, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and does not modify any external state.**
