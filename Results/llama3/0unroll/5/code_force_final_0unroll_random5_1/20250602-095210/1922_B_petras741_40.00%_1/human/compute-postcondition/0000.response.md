Output State: **t is an integer, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**

Explanation: The first line of the code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means that `t` is now an integer. The second line initializes an empty list called `buffer`. The code does not modify the contents of `stdin`, so it still contains `t-1` test cases, each with two lines: the first line contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
