Output State: **The output state will contain the results of each test case, which is the minimum number of operations required to make the string a palindrome. The results will be printed on separate lines. The value of `t` will be 0, as it is decremented in each iteration of the loop. The value of `n` and `s` will be the last test case input. The values of other variables will be the final values after the last iteration of the loop.**
