This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the string a palindrome and prints the result for each test case. The function iterates through each test case, analyzing the string from both ends to find the minimum number of operations needed to make it a palindrome, and prints the result on a separate line.
