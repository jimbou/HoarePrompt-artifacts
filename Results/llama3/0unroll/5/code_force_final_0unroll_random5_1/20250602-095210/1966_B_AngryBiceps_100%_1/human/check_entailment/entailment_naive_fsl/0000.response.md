Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, consider the input:

3 3
BBB
WBW
BBB

The program will output "YES", but it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The program only checks if the first and last rows are the same color, but it does not check if the entire grid can be made the same color.

The program should check if there is a path of the same color from the first row to the last row, or from the first column to the last column. If there is no such path, then it is not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
