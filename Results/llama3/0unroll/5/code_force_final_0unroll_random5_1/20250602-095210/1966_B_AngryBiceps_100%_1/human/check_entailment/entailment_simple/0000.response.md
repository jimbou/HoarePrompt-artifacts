Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program reads the input, which consists of multiple test cases, each containing a grid of characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, the program checks the conditions specified in the loop body to determine whether the grid can be made the same color.

The program first checks if the first and last rows of the grid are the same color and if they are different from each other. If this condition is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to make all squares the same color. This is because if the first and last rows are the same color and different from each other, it means that there are at least two different colors in the grid, and it is not possible to make all squares the same color by performing any number of operations.

The program then checks if the first and last columns of the grid are the same color and if they are different from each other. If this condition is true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to make all squares the same color. This is because if the first and last columns are the same color and different from each other, it means that there are at least two different colors in the grid, and it is not possible to make all squares the same color by performing any number of operations.

If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all squares the same color.

Correctness: **True**
