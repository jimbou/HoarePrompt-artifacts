Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine whether a given grid of 'W' and 'B' characters can be made to have all squares of the same color by performing any number of operations. The program checks two conditions:

1. If the first and last rows are of the same color and different from each other, it prints 'NO'.
2. If the first and last columns are of the same color and different from each other, it prints 'NO'.

If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the first and last rows or columns are of the same color and different from each other, it is impossible to make all squares of the same color by performing any number of operations. This is because the operations can only change the color of a subrectangle, and if the first and last rows or columns are of the same color, there is no way to change the color of the entire grid.

The program correctly implements this logic and should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
