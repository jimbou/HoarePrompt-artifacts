Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of rows and columns in the grid, and the initial colors of the squares as input.

The program first checks if the first and last rows of the grid are the same color. If they are not, it checks if the first and last columns of the grid are the same color. If they are not, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to make all squares the same color.

However, this approach is incorrect. The program should check if there is at least one row or one column that contains both 'W' and 'B'. If such a row or column exists, it is not possible to make all squares the same color.

The correct approach would be to iterate over each row and column of the grid and check if it contains both 'W' and 'B'. If such a row or column is found, the program should print 'NO'. Otherwise, it should print 'YES'.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
