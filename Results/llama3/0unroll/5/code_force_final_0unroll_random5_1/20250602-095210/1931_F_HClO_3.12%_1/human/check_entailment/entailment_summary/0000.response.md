Reasoning: 
The program correctly determines whether there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to. It first checks if the number of screenshots is 1, in which case it prints 'yes' because there is only one possible order. If the number of screenshots is greater than 1, it checks if the order of participants in the first two screenshots is the same, excluding the authors of the screenshots. If the orders are not the same, it prints 'no' because there is no possible order that both screenshots can correspond to. If the orders are the same, it checks if the authors of the screenshots can be inserted into the order without changing the relative order of the other participants. If the authors can be inserted, it checks if the resulting order is consistent with the remaining screenshots. If the order is consistent with all screenshots, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

Correctness: **True**
