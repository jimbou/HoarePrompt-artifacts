The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` first, followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k` followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `k` lines, each containing `n` integers (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different).**
