Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the number of screenshots (m) is greater than 2 and the order of participants in the screenshots is not consistent. The program only checks the order of participants in the first two screenshots and assumes that the order is consistent for all screenshots. However, this assumption is not valid, and the program may produce incorrect results if the order of participants is not consistent across all screenshots.

For example, consider the case where n = 5, m = 3, and the screenshots are:

Screenshot 1: 1 2 3 4 5
Screenshot 2: 2 3 1 4 5
Screenshot 3: 3 1 2 4 5

In this case, the program will incorrectly assume that the order of participants is consistent and produce an incorrect result.

To fix this issue, the program needs to check the order of participants in all screenshots, not just the first two. This can be done by iterating over all screenshots and checking if the order of participants is consistent. If the order is not consistent, the program should produce an error message or return an incorrect result.
