Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings themselves.
2. For each test case, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string `encoded` as input.
3. The function first creates a set of unique characters in the encoded string, sorts them in alphabetical order, and stores them in the `unique_chars` list.
4. The function then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character to its symmetric character in the sorted list. This is done by iterating over the `unique_chars` list and assigning each character to its corresponding symmetric character using the formula `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
5. The function then uses a generator expression to iterate over the encoded string and replace each character with its symmetric character using the `char_map` dictionary. The resulting decoded string is stored in the `decoded` variable.
6. Finally, the program appends the decoded string to the `results` list and prints each result after processing all test cases.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty strings: The program correctly handles empty strings by returning an empty string.
* Strings with duplicate characters: The program correctly handles strings with duplicate characters by only considering unique characters when creating the `char_map` dictionary.
* Strings with non-alphabetical characters: The program correctly handles strings with non-alphabetical characters by ignoring them when creating the `char_map` dictionary.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
