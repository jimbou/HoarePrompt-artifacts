Output State: **`decoded` is a string where each character from `encoded` is replaced with its corresponding reversed unique character from `encoded` as specified in `char_map`, char_map is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a unique character from encoded as the key and the corresponding reversed unique character from encoded as the value, the rest of the variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the `decoded` variable is assigned a new string value that is created by replacing each character in the `encoded` string with its corresponding reversed unique character as specified in the `char_map` dictionary. The `char_map` dictionary remains unchanged, and all other variables also retain their original values.
