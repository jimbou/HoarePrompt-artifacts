Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The program first constructs a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in the encoded string to its corresponding reversed unique character. This is done by iterating over the sorted set of unique characters in the encoded string and mapping each character to its corresponding reversed character.

2. Then, the program uses this dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding reversed unique character. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over each character in the encoded string, looks up its corresponding reversed character in the `char_map` dictionary, and joins the resulting characters into a decoded string.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the encoded string contains duplicate characters, because the `char_map` dictionary only contains unique characters from the encoded string.

4. The program also correctly handles the case where the encoded string contains characters that are not present in the original string, because the `char_map` dictionary only contains characters that are present in the encoded string.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
