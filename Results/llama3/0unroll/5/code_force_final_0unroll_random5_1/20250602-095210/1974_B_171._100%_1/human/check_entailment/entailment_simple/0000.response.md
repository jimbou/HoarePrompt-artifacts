Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first constructs a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in the encoded string to its corresponding reversed unique character. This is done by iterating over the sorted set of unique characters in the encoded string and mapping each character to its corresponding reversed character.

2. Then, the program uses this dictionary to decode the encoded string. It iterates over each character in the encoded string and replaces it with its corresponding reversed unique character using the `char_map` dictionary.

3. The decoded string is then returned as the result.

The program correctly handles the case where the encoded string contains duplicate characters, as the `char_map` dictionary only contains unique characters and their corresponding reversed characters.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
