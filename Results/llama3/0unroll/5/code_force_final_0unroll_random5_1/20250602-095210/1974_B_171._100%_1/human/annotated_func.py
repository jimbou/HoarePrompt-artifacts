#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: char_map is a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of a unique character from encoded as the key and the corresponding reversed unique character from encoded as the value, the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the decoded string where each character from the original encoded string has been replaced with its corresponding reversed unique character as specified in the char_map dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:Replaces each character in the input string with its corresponding reversed unique character, returning the decoded string.
