This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers. It categorizes these integers into three lists based on their first value (1, 2, or 3), then finds and prints the smallest number between the maximum of the first category and the minimum of the second category that is not present in the third category. This process is repeated for each test case, leaving the input stream empty afterwards.
