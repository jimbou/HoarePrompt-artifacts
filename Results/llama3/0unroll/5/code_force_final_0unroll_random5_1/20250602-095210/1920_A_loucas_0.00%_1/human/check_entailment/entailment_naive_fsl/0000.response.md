Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the number of valid integers. The program only checks if the first valid integer (i) is not in the list of excluded numbers (no), but it does not count the total number of valid integers.

For example, in the first test case, the program will output 3 (the first valid integer) instead of 7 (the total number of valid integers). 

To fix this, the program should count the total number of valid integers in the range from the maximum of the lower bounds (big) to the minimum of the upper bounds (less), excluding the numbers in the list (no). 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        max_big = max(big)
        min_less = min(less)
        for i in range(max_big, min_less + 1):
            if i not in no:
                num += 1
        print(num)
```

This corrected program will correctly calculate the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints.
