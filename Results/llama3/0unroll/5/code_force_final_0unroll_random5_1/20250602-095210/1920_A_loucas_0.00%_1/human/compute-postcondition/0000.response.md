The code `loop = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first integer of each test case is the number of lines in that test case. Therefore, `loop` is assigned the value of the number of lines in the first test case.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains `loop` lines, each line containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9)**
