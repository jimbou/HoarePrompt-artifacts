Reasoning: The program is trying to solve the problem by iterating through the constraints and storing them in separate lists based on their types. However, the logic for calculating the number of integers k that satisfy all constraints is incorrect. The program is currently printing the smallest number between the maximum of big and the minimum of less that is not in no, but this is not the correct solution to the problem.

The correct solution should calculate the total number of integers k that satisfy all constraints, not just the smallest one. To do this, the program should calculate the range of possible values for k (i.e., the maximum of big and the minimum of less) and then subtract the number of values in no that fall within this range.

Correctness: **False**
