Output State: **password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string, last_digit_index is -1**

The code assigns the value -1 to the variable last_digit_index. The values of the other variables, password, digits, and letters, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the same information about these variables as the initial state, with the addition of the new variable last_digit_index with the value -1.
