    #State: *The loop will iterate over the entire password string, updating the last_digit_index variable to the index of the last digit encountered. If a letter is encountered after a digit, the loop will return 'NO' and terminate. If no letters are encountered after digits, the loop will complete and the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the last_digit_index variable updated to the index of the last digit in the password string.

    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES', indicating that the password string meets the conditions of having digits in sorted order and letters in sorted order, and no letters are encountered after digits.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if a given password string meets certain conditions and returns 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function accepts a password string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It checks if the digits in the password are in sorted order, if the letters are in sorted order, and if no letters appear after digits. If all conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'. If any condition is not met, the function returns 'NO'.
