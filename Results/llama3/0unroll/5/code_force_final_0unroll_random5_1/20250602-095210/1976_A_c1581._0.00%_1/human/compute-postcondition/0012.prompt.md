You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The loop will iterate over the entire password string, updating the last_digit_index variable to the index of the last digit encountered. If a letter is encountered after a digit, the loop will return 'NO' and terminate. If no letters are encountered after digits, the loop will complete and the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the last_digit_index variable updated to the index of the last digit in the password string.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The loop will iterate over the entire password string, updating the last_digit_index variable to the index of the last digit encountered. If a letter is encountered after a digit, the loop will return 'NO' and terminate. If no letters are encountered after digits, the loop will complete and the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the last_digit_index variable updated to the index of the last digit in the password string. Additionally, the digits in the password string are in sorted order.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO', indicating that the letters in the password string are not in sorted order, and no letters have been encountered after digits, with the last_digit_index variable updated to the index of the last digit in the password string.
    #State: *The loop will iterate over the entire password string, updating the last_digit_index variable to the index of the last digit encountered. If a letter is encountered after a digit, the loop will return 'NO' and terminate. If no letters are encountered after digits, the loop will complete and the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the last_digit_index variable updated to the index of the last digit in the password string. Additionally, the digits in the password string are in sorted order. The letters in the password string are in sorted order.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES', indicating that the password string meets the conditions of having digits in sorted order and letters in sorted order, and no letters are encountered after digits.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO', indicating that the letters in the password string are not in sorted order, and no letters have been encountered after digits, with the last_digit_index variable updated to the index of the last digit in the password string.

Case_3: The program returns 'YES', indicating that the password string meets the conditions of having digits in sorted order and letters in sorted order, and no letters are encountered after digits.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
