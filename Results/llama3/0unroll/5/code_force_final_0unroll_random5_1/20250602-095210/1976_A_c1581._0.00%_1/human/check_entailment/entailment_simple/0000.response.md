Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly checks all the conditions specified in the problem statement. 

1. It first separates the digits and letters in the password string into two separate lists.
2. It then checks if there are any letters after digits in the password string. If it finds any, it immediately returns 'NO'.
3. Next, it checks if the digits in the password string are in sorted order. If they are not, it returns 'NO'.
4. Finally, it checks if the letters in the password string are in sorted order. If they are not, it returns 'NO'.
5. If the password string passes all the above checks, it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and does not contain any logical errors. 

Correctness: **True**
