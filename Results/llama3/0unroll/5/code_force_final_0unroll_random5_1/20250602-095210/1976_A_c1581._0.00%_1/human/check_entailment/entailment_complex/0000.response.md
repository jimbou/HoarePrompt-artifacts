Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to verify if a given password string meets certain conditions. The conditions are:

1.  The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2.  There should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends).
3.  All digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.
4.  All letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.

The program correctly implements these conditions by:

*   Iterating over the password string to separate digits and letters into two lists.
*   Checking if any letter appears after a digit by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable. If a letter is found after a digit, the function immediately returns 'NO'.
*   Verifying if the digits are in sorted order by comparing the list of digits with its sorted version. If they are not equal, the function returns 'NO'.
*   Verifying if the letters are in sorted order by comparing the list of letters with its sorted version. If they are not equal, the function returns 'NO'.

If the password string passes all these checks, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

Correctness: **True**
