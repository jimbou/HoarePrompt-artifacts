Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if a given password is strong according to the conditions specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program first separates the digits and letters from the password.
2. It then checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If such a case is found, it immediately returns 'NO'.
3. Next, it checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either of them is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and returns the correct result for all possible cases. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
