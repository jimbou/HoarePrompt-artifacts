Postcondition: **The loop will iterate over the entire password string, updating the last_digit_index variable to the index of the last digit encountered. If a letter is encountered after a digit, the loop will return 'NO' and terminate. If no letters are encountered after digits, the loop will complete and the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the last_digit_index variable updated to the index of the last digit in the password string. Additionally, the digits in the password string are in sorted order.**
