Postcondition: **The loop has iterated over the entire password string, updating the last_digit_index variable to the index of the last digit encountered. The digits in the password string are in sorted order. The current value of the letters variable is not equal to the sorted letters, indicating that the letters in the password string are not in sorted order. The loop has not returned 'NO' and terminated, and no letters have been encountered after digits. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the last_digit_index variable updated to the index of the last digit in the password string.**
