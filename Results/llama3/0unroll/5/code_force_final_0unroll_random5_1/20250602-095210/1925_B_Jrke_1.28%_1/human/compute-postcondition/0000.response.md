Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k, where k is the integer division of x by n. If k is 1, the output will be 1. Otherwise, the output will be the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to k, considering only odd divisors (since the inner loop iterates over odd numbers).**
