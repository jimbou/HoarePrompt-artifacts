This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers each. It then performs a series of calculations involving modular arithmetic with a large modulus (10^9 + 7) and the inverse of the number of possible pairs of nodes in a graph. The result for each test case is the sum of the products of the inverse of the number of pairs, the number of pairs, the frequency of each pair, and the inverse of the number of pairs again, all taken modulo M. The function prints the result for each test case, one per line.
