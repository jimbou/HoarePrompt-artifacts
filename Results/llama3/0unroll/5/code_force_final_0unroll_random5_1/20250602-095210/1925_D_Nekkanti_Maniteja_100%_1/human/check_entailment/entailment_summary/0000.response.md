Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k). It then reads the m pairs of friends and their friendship values.

The program calculates the inverse of the number of possible pairs of nodes in a graph (n * (n - 1) // 2) modulo M (10^9 + 7) and stores it in the variable c.

The program then calculates the sum of the products of the inverse of the number of pairs, the number of pairs, the frequency of each pair, and the inverse of the number of pairs again, all taken modulo M. This is done in the loop that iterates k times.

Finally, the program prints the result for each test case, one per line.

The program correctly handles the modular arithmetic and the inverse calculations, and it correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

Correctness: **True**
