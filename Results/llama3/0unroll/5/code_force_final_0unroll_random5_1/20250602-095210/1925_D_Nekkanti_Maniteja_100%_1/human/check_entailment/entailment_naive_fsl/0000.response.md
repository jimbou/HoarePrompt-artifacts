Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the line where the sum `s` is calculated. The correct formula for the expected value should be the sum of the probabilities of each pair being chosen multiplied by their respective friendship values, plus the sum of the probabilities of each pair being chosen in the previous excursions multiplied by the number of previous excursions.

However, the program incorrectly calculates this by multiplying the probability of a pair being chosen (`c`) by the number of previous excursions (`i`) and then multiplying it by the probability of a pair being chosen again (`c`) and the number of pairs (`m`). This is not the correct way to calculate the expected value.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion and then summing up these probabilities multiplied by their respective friendship values.
