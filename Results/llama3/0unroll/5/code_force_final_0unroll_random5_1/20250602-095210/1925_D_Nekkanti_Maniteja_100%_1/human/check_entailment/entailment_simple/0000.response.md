Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).

2. It calculates the inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, modulo `M = 10^9 + 7`. This is done using the `pow` function with a negative exponent, which is a common way to compute modular inverses in Python.

3. It initializes a variable `s` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

4. It reads the `m` lines of input, each containing three integers `u`, `v`, and `f`, which represent the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. It adds up all the initial friendship values in the variable `a`.

5. It then iterates `k` times, and in each iteration, it adds to `s` the product of the inverse of the number of pairs, the current iteration number `i`, the inverse of the number of pairs again, and the sum of the initial friendship values `a`. This is the key step where the expected value is calculated.

6. Finally, it prints the result `s` modulo `M` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, which is `âˆ‘(i=1 to k) (c * i * c * m + c * a)`, where `c` is the inverse of the number of pairs, `m` is the number of pairs, `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values, and `k` is the number of excursions.

Correctness: **True**
