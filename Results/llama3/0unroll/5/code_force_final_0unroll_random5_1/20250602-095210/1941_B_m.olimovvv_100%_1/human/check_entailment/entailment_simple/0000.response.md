Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables.
2.  It iterates over the array from the first element to the third last element (inclusive).
3.  For each element, it subtracts twice the value of the current element from the next element and subtracts the value of the current element from the element after the next one. This is equivalent to applying the given operation to the current index.
4.  After the loop, it checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The logic behind this is that if the array can be reduced to zero, then the last two elements must be zero after applying the operations to all the previous elements. This is because the operation can only decrease the values of the elements, and the last two elements cannot be decreased by applying the operation to any previous elements.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether the given array can be reduced to zero by the described operations.

Correctness: **True**
