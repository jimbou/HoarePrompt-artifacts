Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array of integers can be reduced to zero by applying the specified operations. The program iterates through the array, applying the operations and checking if the resulting values are non-negative. If any value becomes negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If the entire array can be reduced to zero, it prints 'YES'. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the last two elements of the array are not zero.

Correctness: **True**
