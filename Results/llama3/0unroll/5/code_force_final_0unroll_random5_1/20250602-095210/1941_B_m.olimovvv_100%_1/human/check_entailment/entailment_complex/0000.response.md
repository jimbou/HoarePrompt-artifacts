Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given sequence of integers can be reduced to zero by the described operations.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the sequence of integers, and applies the operations to the sequence. It checks if the sequence can be reduced to zero by verifying if all elements are non-negative after applying the operations. If any element is negative, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If all elements are non-negative, it checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and provides a separate output for each case. The logic is sound, and the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
