Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 3 5 5 2

The program will output "YES", but the correct output is "NO". The reason is that the program only checks if the last two elements of the array are zero, but it does not check if the entire array can be made zero using the given operation.

In this case, the array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] cannot be made zero using the given operation, because the operation can only decrease the elements of the array, but it cannot increase them. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Note that the program is trying to solve the problem by subtracting the elements of the array from each other, but this approach is not correct. The correct approach is to use a different algorithm that takes into account the fact that the operation can only decrease the elements of the array.
