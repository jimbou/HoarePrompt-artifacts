Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem by iterating through the array from left to right and applying the operation to each element. The operation is applied by subtracting twice the current element from the next element and subtracting the current element from the element after that. This process continues until the second last element is reached.

The program then checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using the given operation. If the last two elements are zero, it prints 'YES'.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The operation is applied to each element without considering the actual values of the elements. The program only checks if the current element is negative, but it does not check if the operation would result in a negative value for the next or the element after that. This could lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the array [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]. The program would apply the operation to the first element, resulting in [1, -1, 1, 5, 2]. Then, it would apply the operation to the second element, resulting in [1, -1, -3, 3, 2]. At this point, the program would print 'NO' because the third element is negative. However, this is incorrect because the operation can still be applied to the third element to make it zero.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
