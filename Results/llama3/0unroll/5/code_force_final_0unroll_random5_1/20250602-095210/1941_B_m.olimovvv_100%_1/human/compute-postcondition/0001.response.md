Functionality: **This function determines whether a given sequence of integers can be reduced to zero by a specific set of operations. It reads a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a sequence of integers. It then applies the operations to the sequence, checking if it can be reduced to zero. If the sequence can be reduced to zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function handles multiple test cases and provides a separate output for each case.**
