Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times.

Function `func_1` checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted, and 'No' if the list is not sorted, indicating that there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second element.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it in iterations, and prints the results. It uses `func_1` to check if each input array can become sorted.

However, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem statement allows for the array to be split into two parts and swapped any number of times, but the program only checks if the array is sorted in ascending order without considering the possibility of swapping parts.

For example, the input array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` can be sorted by swapping the first element with the rest of the array, but the program will return 'No' because it only checks if the array is sorted in ascending order without considering the possibility of swapping.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
