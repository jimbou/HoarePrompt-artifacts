Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.

Function 1 (`func_1`) checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns 'Yes'. If not, it checks if there are any pairs of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads input from the standard input, processes it, and calls Function 1 for each test case.

However, there is a logical flaw in Function 1. The function returns 'Yes' if the array is not sorted and there are no pairs of adjacent elements where the first element is greater than the second. This is incorrect because it does not consider the case where the array can be sorted by swapping the two parts.

For example, the array [7, 9, 2, 2, 3] is not sorted, but it can be sorted by swapping the two parts: [7] and [9, 2, 2, 3]. The function should return 'Yes' for this case, but it returns 'No'.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
