Functionality: **Reads input from standard input, processes it in iterations, and prints the results.**

Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

*   Reads input from standard input, which is expected to be a list of strings where each string represents an integer.
*   Processes the input in iterations, where each iteration involves:
    *   Extracting the number of elements (n) to process from the input data.
    *   Extracting a list of integers (arr) of length n from the input data.
    *   Passing the list of integers (arr) to a function named `func_1` and storing the result.
*   After all iterations are complete, prints the results of each iteration, separated by newline characters.

Note that the functionality does not include any information about what the `func_1` function does, as that is not specified in the provided code.
