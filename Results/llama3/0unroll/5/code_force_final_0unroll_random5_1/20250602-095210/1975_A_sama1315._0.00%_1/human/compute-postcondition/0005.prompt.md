You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, index is a non-negative integer such that index < len(data), t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that n <= len(data) - index - 1, and arr is a list of integers of length n.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: data remains the same list of strings, index is incremented by t + n * t (where n is the length of arr), t remains the same positive integer, results is a list of t elements where each element is the result of func_1(arr) for each iteration, and arr is the last list of integers of length n processed in the loop.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: The results of func_1(arr) for each iteration of the loop, where each result is separated by a newline character

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
