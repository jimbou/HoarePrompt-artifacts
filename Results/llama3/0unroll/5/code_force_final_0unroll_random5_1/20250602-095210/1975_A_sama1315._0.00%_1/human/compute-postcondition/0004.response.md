Output: **data remains the same list of strings, index is incremented by t + n * t (where n is the length of arr), t remains the same positive integer, results is a list of t elements where each element is the result of func_1(arr) for each iteration, and arr is the last list of integers of length n processed in the loop, and the results of func_1(arr) for each iteration of the loop are printed, separated by newline characters.**
