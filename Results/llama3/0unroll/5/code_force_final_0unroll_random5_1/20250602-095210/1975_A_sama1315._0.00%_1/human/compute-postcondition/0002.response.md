Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: data remains the same list of strings, index is incremented by t + n * t (where n is the length of arr), t remains the same positive integer, results is a list of t elements where each element is the result of func_1(arr) for each iteration, and arr is the last list of integers of length n processed in the loop.
