Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them) any number of times.

Function 1 checks if a given list of integers is sorted in ascending order. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted, and 'No' if the list is not sorted.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it in iterations, and prints the results. It uses Function 1 to check if each array can become sorted in non-decreasing order.

However, the problem statement requires checking if the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation any number of times. Function 1 only checks if the array is already sorted in ascending order, but it does not consider the possibility of swapping the two parts of the array.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not fully address the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
