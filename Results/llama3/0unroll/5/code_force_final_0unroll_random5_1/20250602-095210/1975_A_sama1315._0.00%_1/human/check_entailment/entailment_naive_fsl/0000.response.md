Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description states that the array can be split into two parts and the parts can be swapped any number of times. However, the program only checks if the array is already sorted or if it can be sorted by swapping the two parts once.

A counterexample is the array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]. The program will return 'No' because it cannot be sorted by swapping the two parts once. However, it can be sorted by swapping the two parts twice: [3, 1] and [4, 1, 5] -> [4, 1, 5, 3, 1] -> [1, 4, 1, 5, 3] -> [1, 3, 4, 1, 5] -> [1, 3, 1, 4, 5] -> [1, 1, 3, 4, 5].

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the problem description and is incorrect.
