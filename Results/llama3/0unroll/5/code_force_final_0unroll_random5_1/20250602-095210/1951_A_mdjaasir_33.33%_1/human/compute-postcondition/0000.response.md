The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs, the first input is an integer between 1 and 1000, which is assigned to `t`. The second input, a binary string of the same length as the integer, is still in the stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a binary string of length `t`.**
