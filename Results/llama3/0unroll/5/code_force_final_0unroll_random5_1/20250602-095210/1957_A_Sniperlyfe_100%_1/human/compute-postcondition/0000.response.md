Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the variable `arr` still holds its initial value, which is a list of non-negative integers. The code only introduces a new variable `freq` and assigns it an empty dictionary. The dictionary `freq` is empty, meaning it does not contain any key-value pairs.
