#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in `arr` and the values are their respective frequencies.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of the frequencies of the unique elements in the list `arr` by 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of the integer divisions of the frequencies of the unique elements in the input list by 3. It takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns an integer value representing the sum of these divisions. The input list remains unchanged.
