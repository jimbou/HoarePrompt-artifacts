Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally. The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each number in the input list `a` and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` to find the numbers that appear twice in the list. For each such number, it increments the `max_score` by 1, because playing this number will guarantee a point.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If a number appears twice in the list, it will be counted and contribute to the `max_score`.
* If a number appears only once in the list, it will not be counted and will not contribute to the `max_score`.
* If a number does not appear in the list, it will not be counted and will not contribute to the `max_score`.
* The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, returning 0 as the maximum score.

The program also handles the case where the input list `a` contains duplicate numbers correctly, counting each duplicate number only once.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
