Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The program first counts the occurrence of each number in the list `a` and stores it in the dictionary `count_a`. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks if the number appears twice in the list `a`. If it does, it increments the `max_score` by 1. Finally, it returns the `max_score` which is the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player.

The program assumes that the input is valid as described in the problem description, i.e., each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. The program does not handle any invalid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
