Output State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to `n` and its corresponding value is the number of times the integer appears in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, `max_score` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `max_score` which is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
