Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The function `func_1` counts the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the input list `a`, which represents the cards in the player's hand. This count represents the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player, because each integer that appears twice in the player's hand can be used to score a point when the player places the second card with that integer on the table.

Correctness: **True**
