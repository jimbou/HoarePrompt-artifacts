Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.

3. The program then calls the function `func_1` with `nums` as the argument and prints the result.

4. The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'.

5. If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the function calculates the mean amount of water each container should have.

6. The function then iterates over the containers and calculates the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean amount. If this cumulative difference ever becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container have the mean amount, so the function returns 'NO'.

7. If the function iterates over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, so it returns 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
