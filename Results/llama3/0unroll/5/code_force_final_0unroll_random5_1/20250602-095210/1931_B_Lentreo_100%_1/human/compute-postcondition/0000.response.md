Output State: **nums is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of the integers in nums, the sum of the integers in nums is divisible by the length of nums.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is the length of the list `nums`, and the value of `total` is the sum of all integers in `nums`. The relationship between the sum of the integers in `nums` and the length of `nums` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify the list `nums` itself.
