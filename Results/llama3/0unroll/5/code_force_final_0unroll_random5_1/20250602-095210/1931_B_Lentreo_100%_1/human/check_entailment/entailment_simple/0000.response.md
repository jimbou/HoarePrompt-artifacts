Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using a specific operation. The operation allows pouring any amount of water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j.

The program first calculates the mean of the water amounts in all containers. Then, it iterates through the containers and calculates the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container's water amount equal to the mean. In this case, the program returns 'NO'.

If the program completes the iteration without finding a negative cumulative difference, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. In this case, the program returns 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The initial check for the sum of the water amounts being divisible by the number of containers ensures that the mean is an integer, which is necessary for the subsequent calculations.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
