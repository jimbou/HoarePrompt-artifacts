Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the sum of the integers in the list is divisible by the length of the list. If it's not, the program returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list.

2. If the sum is divisible by the length, the program calculates the mean of the integers by dividing the sum by the length.

3. The program then iterates over the list of integers, keeping a running total of the differences between each integer and the mean. If at any point this running total becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the current container have the mean amount of water.

4. If the program finishes iterating over the list without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES'. This is correct because it means that there is enough water in the previous containers to make each container have the mean amount of water.

5. The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
