Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The function `func_1` calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have, and then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current container's amount and the mean. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to pour into the current container to make it equal to the mean, so the function returns 'NO'.

If the function completes the iteration without finding a negative cumulative difference, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1, or where the amount of water in each container is already equal to the mean.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
