Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
2.  It then calculates the mean amount of water each container should have if the water is distributed evenly.
3.  The program initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
4.  It then iterates over the containers. For each container, it adds the difference between the container's water amount and the mean to `curr`. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to distribute to the current container, so it returns 'NO'.
5.  If the program completes the iteration without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
