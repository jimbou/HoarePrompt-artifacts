Postcondition: ***low is the index of k in arr, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that are greater than k, pos is the index of k in arr, n, arr, and k remain unchanged. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed, and low + 1 and pos + 1 are printed, where low + 1 is equal to high and pos + 1 is equal to the index of k in arr + 1.***
