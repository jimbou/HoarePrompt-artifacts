Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of the target element `k` in the permutation `arr`. The program first finds the actual index of `k` in `arr` and stores it in the variable `pos`. Then, it performs a binary search to find the index of `k` in `arr`. If the binary search finds the correct index of `k`, it prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. Otherwise, it prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed, and prints the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

The program correctly handles the case where the binary search does not find the correct index of `k`, which can happen if the permutation is not sorted. In this case, the program swaps the elements at the indices `low` and `pos` to move the element `k` to its correct position.

The program also correctly handles the case where the binary search finds the correct index of `k`, in which case no swaps are needed.

Overall, the program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
