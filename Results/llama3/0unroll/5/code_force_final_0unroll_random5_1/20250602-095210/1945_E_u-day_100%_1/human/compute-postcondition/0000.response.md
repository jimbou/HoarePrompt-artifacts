Output State: **n and k are positive integers, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, and k is an element in arr, pos is -1**

The code executes three lines. The first line calls a function named func_1 and assigns its return values to n and k. Since n and k are positive integers, and the function does not change their data type, n and k remain positive integers. The second line calls another function named func_2 and assigns its return value to arr. Since arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, and the function does not change its data type, arr remains a list of distinct integers from 1 to n. The third line assigns -1 to pos. 

Since the functions func_1 and func_2 are not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot determine their exact effects on n, k, and arr. However, based on the given information, we can conclude that n and k remain positive integers, arr remains a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, and k remains an element in arr. The value of pos is set to -1.
