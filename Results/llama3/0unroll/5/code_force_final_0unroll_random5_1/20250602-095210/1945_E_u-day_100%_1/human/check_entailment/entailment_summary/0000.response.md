Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, converts each integer to an integer type, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers. Then, it takes no parameters and returns a list containing all the values yielded by the iterator returned by func_1. It effectively converts the iterator into a list, providing a collection of all values produced by func_1. 

The main function, func_3, searches for the index of a given element `k` in a sorted list `arr` of distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and prints the result. If `k` is found, prints 0. If `k` is not found, prints 1 followed by the index of the next element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, and the index of `k` in `arr` plus one. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `arr`, and `k`. 

The program meets the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
