You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, and k is an element in arr.
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: The value of pos is the index of k in arr, and the values of n, arr, and k remain unchanged.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low is the index of k in arr, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that are greater than k, pos is the index of k in arr, n, arr, and k remain unchanged.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high (which is low + 1), pos + 1 (which is the index of the element after k)
    #State: *low is the index of k in arr, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that are greater than k, pos is the index of k in arr, n, arr, and k remain unchanged. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, 0 is printed. Otherwise, 1 is printed, and low + 1 and pos + 1 are printed, where low + 1 is equal to high and pos + 1 is equal to the index of k in arr + 1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: low is the index of k in arr, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that are greater than k, pos is the index of k in arr, n, arr, and k remain unchanged. The current value of arr[low] is equal to k, and 0 is being printed

Case_2: low is the index of k in arr, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that are greater than k, pos is the index of k in arr, n, arr, and k remain unchanged. The element at index low in arr is not equal to k, 1 is being printed, and this is being printed: low + 1 and pos + 1, where low + 1 is equal to high and pos + 1 is equal to the index of k in arr + 1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
