Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of a given element `k` in a sorted list `arr` of distinct integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is found, the program prints 0. If `k` is not found, the program prints 1 followed by the index of the next element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, and the index of `k` in `arr` plus one. The program does not modify the input variables `n`, `arr`, and `k`.

Correctness: **True**
