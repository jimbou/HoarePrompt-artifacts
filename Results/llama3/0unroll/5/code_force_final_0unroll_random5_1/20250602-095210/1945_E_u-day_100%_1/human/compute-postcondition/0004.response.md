Output State: **low is the index of k in arr, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that are greater than k, pos is the index of k in arr, n, arr, and k remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has found the index of the element k in the array arr and has stored it in the variable low. The variable high is set to low + 1, indicating that the search space has been narrowed down to a single element. The set st contains the indices of all elements in arr that are greater than k, which were encountered during the search process. The variables pos, n, arr, and k remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
