Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not sorted, so the program allows for up to 2 swaps to be made before running the binary search algorithm.

The program first reads the input, which includes the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x`, as well as the permutation `p` itself. It then finds the position `pos` of `x` in the permutation.

The program then performs a binary search on the permutation, but with a twist. Instead of updating the `low` and `high` variables based on the comparison of `p[mid]` and `x`, it updates them based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` and `k`. This is because the permutation is not sorted, so the binary search algorithm needs to be modified to work correctly.

The program keeps track of the indices that are visited during the binary search using a set `st`. This is not necessary for the correctness of the algorithm, but it may be useful for debugging purposes.

If the binary search finds `x` at the `low` index, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps were needed. Otherwise, it prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed, and prints the indices of the swap.

The program assumes that the input is valid, i.e., that `x` is present in the permutation and that the permutation is indeed a permutation of size `n`.

Correctness: **True**
