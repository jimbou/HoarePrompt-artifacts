Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `low` is the index of `k` in `arr`, but it's also mentioned that the element at index `low` in `arr` is not equal to `k`. This implies that `low` is not the actual index of `k`, but rather an index that is being used as a reference.
* `high` is `low + 1`, so `high` is the next index after `low`.
* `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`, which means it's the actual index where `k` is located.

Now, let's look at the print statement:

`print(low + 1, pos + 1)`

* `low + 1` will print the next index after `low`, which is `high`.
* `pos + 1` will print the index of `k` in `arr` plus one, which is the index of the element after `k`.

Since `1` is being printed, we can assume that the print statement is printing the indices of the elements in `arr` that are being considered.

Output: **high (which is low + 1), pos + 1 (which is the index of the element after k)**
