Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6

The program will output:

0

However, the correct output should be:

1
3 4

Because the binary search algorithm will not find the correct position of the number 3 in the array, and we need to swap the elements at positions 3 and 4 to make the array sorted.

The program only checks if the element at the low index is equal to the target number, but it does not consider the case where the target number is not at the low index, but can be found by swapping two elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
