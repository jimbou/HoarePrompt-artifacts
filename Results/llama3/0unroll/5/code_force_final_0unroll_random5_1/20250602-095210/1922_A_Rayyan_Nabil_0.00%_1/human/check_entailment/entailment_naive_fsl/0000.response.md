Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the strings a and b have the same character at a position, but the string c has a different character at the same position. In this case, the program will print 'NO', but the correct answer should be 'YES' because we can create a template with an uppercase letter at that position, which will match a and b but not c.

For example, if the input is:

3
a
a
b

The program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES' because we can create a template 'A' which matches 'a' and 'a' but not 'b'.
