Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs 'YES' if any test case has a position where both strings 'a' and 'b' differ from string 'c', otherwise outputs 'NO'. The function does not modify the input variable 't' and only uses it to control the number of test cases to process.**
