Reasoning: The given program is correct. It iterates through each character in the strings a, b, and c. If it finds a position where both a and b have different characters than c, it sets the variable l to 'YES'. If it doesn't find such a position after checking all characters, it sets l to 'NO'. This is in line with the problem description, which requires that there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program's logic ensures that this condition is met.

Correctness: **True**
