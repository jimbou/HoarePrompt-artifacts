Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which includes the number of test cases `t` and the test cases themselves, each consisting of an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
* The program iterates over each test case and checks if there exists a position `i` where both strings `a` and `b` have different characters than string `c`. This is done by checking if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` for each position `i`.
* If such a position is found, the program sets the variable `l` to `'YES'`. If no such position is found after checking all positions, the program sets `l` to `'NO'`.
* The program prints the value of `l` for each test case, which correctly indicates whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not.

The program's logic is correct, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
