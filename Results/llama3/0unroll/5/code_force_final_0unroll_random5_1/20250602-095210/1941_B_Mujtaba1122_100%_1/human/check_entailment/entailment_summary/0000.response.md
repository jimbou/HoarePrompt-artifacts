Correctness: **False**

Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem. The operation allows Rudolf to choose an index `i` and assign `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, and `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`. However, the function `func_2` modifies the list by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`, `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, and `1 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`, which is not equivalent to the described operation.

Furthermore, the function `func_2` checks if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the loop, and if so, prints 'no' and terminates. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made zero using the described operation. The function should instead check if the array can be made zero by repeatedly applying the operation, which is not done correctly in the given program.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect and does not meet the problem description.
