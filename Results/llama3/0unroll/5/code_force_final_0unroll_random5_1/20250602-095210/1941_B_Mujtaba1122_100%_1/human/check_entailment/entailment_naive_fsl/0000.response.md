Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 7, 2], the program will print 'NO' but it should print 'NO' because it is not possible to make all the elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly check if it is possible to make all the elements of the array zero. The function func_2 does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem, and the function func_1 only checks if all elements of the array are zero, but it does not check if it is possible to make all the elements zero using the described operations.

A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the elements of the array is a multiple of 3, and if the array can be made zero by applying the operation described in the problem.
