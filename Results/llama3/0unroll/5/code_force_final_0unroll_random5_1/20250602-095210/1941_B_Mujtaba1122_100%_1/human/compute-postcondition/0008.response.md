Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer n as input, where n is equal to the length of the list and is greater than or equal to 3. It modifies the list by iterating through it and performing operations on the elements at indices 1 to n-2, such that each element at these indices becomes either 0 or 1, while the elements at indices 0 and n-1 remain unchanged. If any element at index i-1 (1 <= i <= n-2) is not 0 after the loop, the function prints 'no' and terminates. Otherwise, it continues execution and checks the modified list using the func_1 function. If func_1 returns True, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
