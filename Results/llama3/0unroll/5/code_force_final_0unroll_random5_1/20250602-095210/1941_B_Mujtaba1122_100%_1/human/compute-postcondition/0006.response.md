Output: **The list is modified such that each element at index i (1 <= i <= n-2) is either 0 or 1, and the elements at indices 0 and n-1 remain unchanged. If any element at index i-1 (1 <= i <= n-2) is not 0 after the loop, the program prints 'no' and terminates. Otherwise, the program continues execution. Additionally, the function func_1(list, n) returns False, and 'NO' is printed**
