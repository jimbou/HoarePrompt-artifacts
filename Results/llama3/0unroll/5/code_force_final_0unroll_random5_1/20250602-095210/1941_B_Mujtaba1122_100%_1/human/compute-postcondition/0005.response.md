Based on the precondition, the program has already determined that at least one element at index i-1 (1 <= i <= n-2) is not 0 after the loop, which caused the program to print 'no' and terminate. However, the print statement in question is 'NO' (in uppercase).

Since the program has already terminated due to the condition being met, the print statement 'NO' will still be executed before the program terminates.

Output: **NO**
