Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, a is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the input integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, b is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each containing two integers n and q, followed by n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, followed by q lines, each containing two integers l_i and r_i.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `q` are assigned from the input. The list `a` is created with `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0, and the remaining elements are the input integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`. The list `b` is created with `n+1` zeros. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases, each with the same structure as before, but with one test case already processed.
