The list `a` is updated to contain the cumulative sum of its elements, starting from the first element (index 0) up to the nth element (index n). The first element of list `a` (index 0) is the same as the original first element, the second element of list `a` (index 1) is the sum of the first two elements of the original list, the third element of list `a` (index 2) is the sum of the first three elements of the original list, and so on. The list `b` still contains the cumulative sum of the number of times each element in list `a` is greater than 1, starting from the second element (index 1) up to the nth element (index n). The first element of list `b` (index 0) remains 0.

Output State: **The list `a` contains the cumulative sum of its elements, and the list `b` contains the cumulative sum of the number of times each element in list `a` is greater than 1, starting from the second element (index 1) up to the nth element (index n), and the first element of list `b` (index 0) is 0.**
