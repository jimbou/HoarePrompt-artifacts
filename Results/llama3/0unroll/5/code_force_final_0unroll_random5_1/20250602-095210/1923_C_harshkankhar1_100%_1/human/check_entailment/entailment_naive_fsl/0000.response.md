Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `a` and the cumulative sum of the array `b`, where `b[i]` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1 and 2 otherwise. This is done to ensure that the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than the sum of the corresponding elements in the array `b`.

The program then checks for each query whether the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in the array `b`. If it is, the program prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the subarray has only one element, in which case it prints "NO" because the sum of the elements in the subarray is not greater than the sum of the corresponding elements in the array `b`.

The program also handles the case where the subarray has more than one element and the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in the array `b`, in which case it prints "YES".

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good".
