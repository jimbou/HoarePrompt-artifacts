Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the condition a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y. It does not modify the input values and does not have any side effects beyond printing the results. The function's purpose is to determine whether a certain condition is met for each query and provide a corresponding output.**
