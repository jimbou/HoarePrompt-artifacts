Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good". The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `a` and the cumulative sum of the array `b`, where `b[i]` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1 and 2 otherwise. This is done to ensure that the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than the sum of the corresponding elements in the array `b`.

The program then checks for each query whether the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in the array `b`. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element, in which case it prints 'NO' because a single element cannot be rearranged to meet the conditions.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be considered "good" and provides the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
