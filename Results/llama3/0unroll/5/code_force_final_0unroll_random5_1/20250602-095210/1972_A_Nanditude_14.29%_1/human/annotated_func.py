#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where the first element is an integer, the second and third elements are lists of integers of the same length as the first element, and the integers in the second and third lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of lists, where the first element is an integer, the second and third elements are lists of integers of the same length as the first element, and the integers in the second and third lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The list of lists is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each sublist.

#Overall this is what the function does:Sorts a list of lists in descending order based on the first element of each sublist, while maintaining the non-decreasing order of integers in the second and third lists of each sublist.
