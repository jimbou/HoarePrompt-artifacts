The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple inputs, with the first input being an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). This integer is assigned to the variable t. The remaining inputs in stdin are t test cases, each consisting of two lines: an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases, each consisting of two lines: an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) and n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).**
