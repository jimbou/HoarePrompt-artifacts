Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer n followed by n-1 integers.
2. It initializes the first element of the array a to 1000, which satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
3. The program then calculates the cumulative sum of the input integers, starting with the initial value of 1000. This ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n, as required by the problem statement.
4. The program prints the resulting sequence for each test case, which satisfies the output format requirements.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, calculating the cumulative sum of the input integers and printing the resulting sequence for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
