Output State: **The loop will print the cumulative sum of the input integers for each test case, with the first element being 1000.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop will print the cumulative sum of the input integers for each test case, starting with 1000 as the first element. For example, if the input is:

3
2 3
4 5 6
5 7 8 9 10

The output will be:

1000 1003 1006
1000 1004 1009 1015
1000 1007 1015 1024 1034

This means that for each test case, the loop will print the cumulative sum of the input integers, starting with 1000 as the first element.
