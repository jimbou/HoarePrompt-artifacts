Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program takes an array of integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` as input and constructs an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

The program initializes the first element of the array `a` to 1000, which is within the allowed range of `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. Then, for each subsequent element `a_i`, it calculates the value as `a_{i-1} + x_i`, which ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases. For example, if the input array is `[2, 4, 1]`, the program will output `[1000, 1002, 1006, 1007]`, which satisfies the conditions.

The program also handles cases where the input array has only two elements, such as `[500]`, and outputs `[1000, 1500]`, which is correct.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
