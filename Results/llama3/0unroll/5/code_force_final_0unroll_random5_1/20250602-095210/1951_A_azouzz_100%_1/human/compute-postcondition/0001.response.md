Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50. For each iteration, the loop has read an integer `n` and a binary string `s` from stdin, and printed either 'YES' or 'NO' to stdout based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` have been updated for each iteration, but their initial values are no longer available. The output state only contains the results of the loop executions, which are the printed 'YES' or 'NO' values for each test case.**
