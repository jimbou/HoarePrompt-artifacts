Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the number of lamps is 2 and the desired configuration is "11". In this case, the program should print "NO" because it is not possible to turn on both lamps by choosing two non-adjacent lamps. However, the program prints "YES" because it only checks if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and if the count is even. 

Here is an example of the incorrect output:

Input:
2
2
11

Output:
YES

Expected Output:
NO
