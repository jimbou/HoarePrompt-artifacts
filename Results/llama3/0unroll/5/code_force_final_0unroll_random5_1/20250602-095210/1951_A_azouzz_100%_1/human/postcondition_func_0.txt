This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a binary string s of length n. It then checks the binary string s based on the following conditions: if the count of '1's in s is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count of '1's is greater than 2 but odd, it prints 'NO'; if the count of '1's is 1, it prints 'NO'; if the string contains '11', it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function repeats this process for each test case and outputs the results to standard output.
