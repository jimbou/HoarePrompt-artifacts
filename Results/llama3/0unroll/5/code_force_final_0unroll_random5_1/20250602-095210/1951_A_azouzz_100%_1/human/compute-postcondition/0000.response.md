Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is a positive integer less than or equal to 50. The stdin now contains one less test case, and each remaining test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.
