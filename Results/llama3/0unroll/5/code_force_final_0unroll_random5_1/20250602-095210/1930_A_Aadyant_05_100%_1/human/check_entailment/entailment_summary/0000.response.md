Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (a) and then reads the 2n integers.
3. It sorts the 2n integers in ascending order.
4. It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the smaller number of each pair to the sum (s).
5. Finally, it appends the sum (s) to the final list and prints it after processing all test cases.

This logic aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the maximum final score by performing n moves, where each move involves choosing two integers, adding the smaller one to the score, and erasing both integers.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading input, processing it, and printing output without returning any value.

Correctness: **True**
