Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of integers (n) and the 2n integers. It then sorts the integers in ascending order and calculates the sum of the smallest numbers in each pair of integers.

The program's logic is correct because it follows the problem's requirements:

1. It reads the correct number of inputs for each test case.
2. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together.
3. It calculates the sum of the smallest numbers in each pair, which is the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program's output is also correct because it prints the maximum final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
