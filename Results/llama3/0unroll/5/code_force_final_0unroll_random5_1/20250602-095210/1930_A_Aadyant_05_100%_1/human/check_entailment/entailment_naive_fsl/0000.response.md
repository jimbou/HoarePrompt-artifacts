Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. It takes the number of test cases as input, then for each test case, it takes the number of integers on the whiteboard (2n) and the 2n integers as input. It sorts the integers in ascending order and then calculates the maximum final score by adding the smaller of each pair of integers.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the number of integers on the whiteboard is odd (2n+1), the program still works correctly because it only considers pairs of integers.
* When the integers on the whiteboard are all the same, the program still works correctly because it adds the smaller of each pair, which is the same integer.
* When the integers on the whiteboard are in any order, the program still works correctly because it sorts the integers before calculating the maximum final score.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the number of test cases is 1, or when the number of integers on the whiteboard is 2.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
