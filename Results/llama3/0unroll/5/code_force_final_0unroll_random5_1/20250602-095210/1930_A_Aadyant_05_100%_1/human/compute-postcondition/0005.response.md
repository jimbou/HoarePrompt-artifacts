Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. The function sorts these 2n integers, pairs them up, and calculates the sum of the smallest number in each pair. It then prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value but instead prints the results directly.**
