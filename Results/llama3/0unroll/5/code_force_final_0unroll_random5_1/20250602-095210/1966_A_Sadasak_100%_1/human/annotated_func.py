    #The program returns a dictionary named frequency_table that contains the frequency of each integer in the arr list, with a maximum frequency of k. The dictionary contains the frequency of each integer in the arr list, and the maximum frequency is k. The arr list and the value of k remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a frequency table of integers in a given list, capping the maximum frequency of each integer at a specified value k. It returns a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer, limited to a maximum of k. The original list and the value of k remain unchanged.
