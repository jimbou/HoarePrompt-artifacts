Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer, and 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the code has created a new empty dictionary called `frequency_table`. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition 2 <= k <= 100 is still valid. The new dictionary `frequency_table` is empty, meaning it has no key-value pairs.
