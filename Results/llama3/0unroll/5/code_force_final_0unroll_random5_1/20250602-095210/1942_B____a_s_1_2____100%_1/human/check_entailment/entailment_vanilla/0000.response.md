Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The program uses the definition of `MEX` to calculate the elements of `p` in reverse order.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes an array `p` of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`.
4. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p`.
5. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
6. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
7. It then updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p` up to the current index `i`.
8. Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct because it uses the definition of `MEX` to calculate the elements of `p` in reverse order. By iterating over the array `a` in reverse order, the program can ensure that the calculated elements of `p` satisfy the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for each `i`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
