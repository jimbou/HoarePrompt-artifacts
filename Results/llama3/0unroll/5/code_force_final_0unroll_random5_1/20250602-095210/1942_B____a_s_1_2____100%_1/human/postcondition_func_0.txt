This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the transformed output for each test case. It accepts a series of integers as input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n, representing the number of elements in the test case, followed by n integers. The function calculates a new set of integers p based on the input values and prints the transformed output for each test case. The output is a list of t lines, where each line contains n integers representing the calculated values of p.
