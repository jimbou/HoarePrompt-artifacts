Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of `t`, `n`, and `a` from the standard input.
2. It initializes an array `p` of size `n` with all elements set to `-1`, which will be used to store the permutation.
3. It initializes a variable `mex` to `n`, which will be used to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p`.
4. The program then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`). For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`.
5. The program then updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p`.
6. Finally, the program prints the values of `p` as the output.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly implements the formula `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` to construct the permutation `p` from the array `a`. The use of the `mex` variable to keep track of the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in `p` is also correct.

Therefore, the program produces the correct output for the given input, and its correctness is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
