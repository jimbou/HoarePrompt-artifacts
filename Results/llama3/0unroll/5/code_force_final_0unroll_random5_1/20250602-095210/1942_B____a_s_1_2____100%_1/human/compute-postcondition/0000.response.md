Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each `a_i` is between `-n` and `n`.
