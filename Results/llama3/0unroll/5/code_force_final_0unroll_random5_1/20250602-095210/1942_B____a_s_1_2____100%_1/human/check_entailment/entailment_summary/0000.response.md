Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the transformed output for each test case.
2.  It accurately calculates the values of `p` based on the input values of `a` using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to index `i`.
3.  The program initializes `mex` to `n` and updates it to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` in each iteration, ensuring that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array `p` up to the current index.
4.  The program correctly handles the case where `a_i` can be negative, as it uses the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` to calculate `p[i]`, which can result in a negative value for `p[i]`.
5.  The program prints the transformed output for each test case, which is a list of `n` integers representing the calculated values of `p`.

Correctness: **True**
