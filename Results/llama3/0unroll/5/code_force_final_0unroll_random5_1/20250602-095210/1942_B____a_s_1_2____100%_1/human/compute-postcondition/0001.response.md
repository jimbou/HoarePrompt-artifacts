Output State: **The output state is a list of t lines, where each line contains n integers. The integers in each line are the values of p, which are calculated based on the input values of n and a. The values of p are determined by the formula p[i] = mex - a[i], where mex is the minimum value of p[i] and n. The output state is a transformed version of the input state, where each test case is processed and the corresponding values of p are printed.**
