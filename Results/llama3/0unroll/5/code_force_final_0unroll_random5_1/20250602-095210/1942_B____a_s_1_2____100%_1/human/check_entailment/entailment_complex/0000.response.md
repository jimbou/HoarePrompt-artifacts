Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a`. The program reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the transformed output for each test case.

The program's logic is based on the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum value of `p[i]` and `n`. The program iterates through the array `a` in reverse order, calculating the values of `p` based on the formula and updating the value of `mex` accordingly.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing its logic and comparing it with the problem description. The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, and its logic is consistent with the problem description.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program's logic. In the line `mex = min(mex, p[i])`, the program updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. However, this update is not necessary, as the value of `mex` is already guaranteed to be the minimum value of `p[i]` and `n` due to the previous calculations.

Despite this minor issue, the program's overall logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
