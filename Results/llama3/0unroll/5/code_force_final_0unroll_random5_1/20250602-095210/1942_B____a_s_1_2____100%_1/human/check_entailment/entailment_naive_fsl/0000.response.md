Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The key insight is to start from the end of the array and work backwards, maintaining the minimum non-negative integer `mex` that does not appear in the constructed permutation so far.

The program initializes `mex` to `n` and then iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the corresponding element `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the constructed permutation so far.

The program then prints the constructed permutation `p`.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `a[i]` is negative or when `mex` is updated to a smaller value. The program also correctly handles the case when there are multiple possible permutations `p` that satisfy the given array `a`, as it is enough to print one of them.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
