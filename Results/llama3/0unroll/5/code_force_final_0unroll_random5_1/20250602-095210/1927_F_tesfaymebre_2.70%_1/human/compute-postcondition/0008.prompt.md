You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: curr is a non-negative integer, parent is a non-negative integer, path is a list of non-negative integers, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph, graph is a list of lists of non-negative integers representing the adjacency list of the graph, and node_v is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph.
    if (colors[curr] == 1) :
        return path
        #The program returns a list of non-negative integers representing the path, which includes the current vertex 'curr' with a color of 1, and all the vertices in the path from the root to the current vertex 'curr' in the graph.
    #State: *curr is a non-negative integer, parent is a non-negative integer, path is a list of non-negative integers, colors is a list of integers with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph, graph is a list of lists of non-negative integers representing the adjacency list of the graph, and node_v is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the graph. The color of the current node (colors[curr]) is not equal to 1.
    colors[curr] = 1
    path.append(curr)
    for nei in graph[curr]:
        if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
            res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
            set_res = set(res)
            if res and node_v in set_res:
                return res
        
    #State: Output State: colors[curr] is 2, path contains the original list of non-negative integers plus the value of curr appended at the end, all other variables remain unchanged.
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list of non-negative integers representing the path, which includes the current vertex 'curr' with a color of 1, and all the vertices in the path from the root to the current vertex 'curr' in the graph.

Case_2: The program returns an empty list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
