Output State: **colors[curr] is 2, path contains the original list of non-negative integers plus the value of curr appended at the end, all other variables remain unchanged.**

The code assigns the value 2 to colors[curr], which means the color of the current node (represented by curr) is now 2. The path variable still contains the original list of non-negative integers with the value of curr appended at the end. All other variables remain unchanged, as the code only updates the colors[curr] variable.
