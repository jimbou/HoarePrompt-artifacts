The code snippet modifies the `colors` list and the `path` list. The first line assigns 1 to the `curr` index of the `colors` list, effectively changing the color of the current node to 1. The second line appends the value of `curr` to the `path` list, adding the current node to the path.

Output State: **colors[curr] is 1, path contains the original list of non-negative integers plus the value of curr appended at the end, all other variables remain unchanged**
