Functionality: **This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) in a graph, starting from a given vertex 'curr', and returns a list of vertices representing the path from the root to the current vertex 'curr' if the color of 'curr' is 1, or an empty list if no such path is found. The function also updates the colors of visited vertices to 1 (for the current vertex) and 2 (for vertices that have been fully explored).**
