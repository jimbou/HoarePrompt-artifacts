Output: **The loop has iterated over all edges in the graph, and the DSU object has been updated accordingly. The minimum edge weight _min_edge has been updated to the minimum weight of all edges in the graph, and the nodes node_u and node_v have been updated to the nodes of the minimum edge. The DSU object dsu has been updated to reflect the connected components of the graph after considering all edges. The variables n, graph, and edges remain unchanged. A list of colors with n+1 elements has been initialized, all set to 0. The dfs function has been called with node_u as the starting node, -1 as the parent node, and an empty list as the third argument, but the return value has not been stored, and the minimum edge weight which is _min_edge and the length of the result list which is len(res) are being printed, and the elements of the result list res are being printed**
