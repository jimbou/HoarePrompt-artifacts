Functionality: **This function generates a graph with n nodes and m edges, sorts the edges in descending order of their weights, and then iterates over the sorted edges to find the minimum edge weight and the nodes connected by this edge. It uses a disjoint-set data structure (DSU) to keep track of the connected components of the graph. After finding the minimum edge, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from one of the nodes of the minimum edge and prints the minimum edge weight, the number of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, and the nodes in the cycle of the graph starting from the node of the minimum edge.**
