Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program finds the cycle in the graph. The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycle, but it does not guarantee that the cycle found is the one with the minimum weight edge.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:

6 6
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 1 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 4 1

In this case, the program will find the cycle 1-2-3-1, but the cycle with the minimum weight edge is actually 4-5-6-4.

The program's DFS approach does not consider all possible cycles in the graph, and it does not guarantee that the cycle found is the one with the minimum weight edge. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
