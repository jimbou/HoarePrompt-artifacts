The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. 

After the code is executed, the integer t is read from stdin and assigned to `num_tests`. 

Therefore, the value of `num_tests` is now an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). 

The remaining input in stdin is t test cases. 

Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
