Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the list of sign periodicities, and for each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur by rounding up the current year to the nearest multiple of the sign's periodicity. This is done using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which effectively rounds up `start_year` to the nearest multiple of `nums[x]`.

The program correctly handles the case where the signs occur sequentially, and it correctly outputs the year when the last sign will occur.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the examples provided, and it seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
