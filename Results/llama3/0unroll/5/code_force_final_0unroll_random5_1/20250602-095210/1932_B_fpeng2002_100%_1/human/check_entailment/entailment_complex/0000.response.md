Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over each test case using a while loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` from the input.
3. It initializes the `start_year` variable to 0, which will store the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur.
4. The program then iterates over the periodicities of the signs using a for loop. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign by dividing the current `start_year` by the periodicity of the sign, adding 1 to the result, and then multiplying the result by the periodicity of the sign. This effectively calculates the next multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`.
5. The program prints the final `start_year` value, which represents the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur.

The program's logic is correct because it simulates the process of waiting for each sign to occur sequentially, starting from the first sign. The use of integer division and multiplication ensures that the program calculates the correct next occurrence of each sign.

Correctness: **True**
