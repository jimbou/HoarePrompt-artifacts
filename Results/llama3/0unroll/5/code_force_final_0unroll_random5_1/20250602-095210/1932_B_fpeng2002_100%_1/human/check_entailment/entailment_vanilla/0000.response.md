Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The signs occur sequentially, and the i-th sign occurs every a_i years.

The given program uses a while loop to iterate over the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (n) and the periodicities of the signs (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

The program then initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign occurs. It then iterates over the periodicities of the signs using a for loop.

In each iteration, it calculates the year in which the current sign will occur by using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula works as follows:

- `start_year // nums[x]` calculates the number of times the current sign has occurred before the current year.
- `+ 1` increments this count by 1, because the current sign will occur one more time.
- `* nums[x]` multiplies the incremented count by the periodicity of the current sign, which gives the year in which the current sign will occur.

The program then updates the `start_year` variable with the calculated year.

Finally, the program prints the `start_year` variable, which represents the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Correctness: **True**
