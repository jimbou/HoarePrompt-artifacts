Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The program iterates over the list of periodicities, and for each periodicity, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur by dividing the current year by the periodicity, rounding up to the nearest integer, and then multiplying by the periodicity. This ensures that the next sign will occur strictly after the previous sign.

The program also correctly handles the case where the periodicity is 1, in which case the sign will occur in the next year.

The execution summary is also correct, as it describes the program's behavior accurately.

Correctness: **True**
