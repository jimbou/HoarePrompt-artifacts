Output State: **num_tests = 0, n = last value from input, nums = last list of integers from input, start_year = last calculated start year**.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `num_tests` is decremented to 0, `n` holds the last value from the input, `nums` holds the last list of integers from the input, and `start_year` holds the last calculated start year based on the last list of integers. The loop iterates through each test case, processing the input and updating the variables accordingly. After all test cases have been processed, the loop terminates, leaving the variables in their final state.
