Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a while loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It initializes the `start_year` variable to 0, which represents the year when the first sign occurs.
4. The program then iterates over the list of periodicities `nums`. For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it calculates the next occurrence of the sign by dividing the current `start_year` by `nums[x]`, rounding up to the nearest integer using the `//` operator, adding 1, and then multiplying the result by `nums[x]`. This effectively calculates the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.
5. The program updates the `start_year` variable with the newly calculated value.
6. After iterating over all periodicities, the program prints the final `start_year` value, which represents the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem description accurately. The use of the `//` operator to round up to the nearest integer is a clever trick to calculate the next multiple of a number.

Correctness: **True**
