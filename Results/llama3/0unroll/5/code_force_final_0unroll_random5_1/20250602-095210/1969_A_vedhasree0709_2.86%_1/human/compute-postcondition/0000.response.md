Output State: **The output state is a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of swaps required to sort the list of distinct integers. If a pair of adjacent elements is found where the first element is equal to the second index plus 2 and the second element is equal to the first index plus 1, the output is 2. Otherwise, the output is 3. The number of output integers is equal to the input integer t.**
