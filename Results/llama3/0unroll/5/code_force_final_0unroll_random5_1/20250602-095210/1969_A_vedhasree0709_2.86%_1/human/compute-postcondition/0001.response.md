Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of distinct integers. It then determines the minimum number of swaps required to sort the list. If a specific condition is met, where a pair of adjacent elements is found in a particular order, the function outputs 2. Otherwise, it outputs 3. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the minimum number of swaps required for each case.**
