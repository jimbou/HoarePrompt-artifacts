Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
3 4 1 2

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2. The friends 1 and 2 can come to the party if they both receive an invitation, and their best friends 3 and 4 also receive an invitation.

The program only checks for a specific pattern in the input list, but it does not consider all possible cases. It assumes that if the pattern is not found, the minimum number of invitations is 3, which is not always true.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible pairs of friends and their best friends, and find the minimum number of invitations that would allow at least 2 friends to come to the party.
