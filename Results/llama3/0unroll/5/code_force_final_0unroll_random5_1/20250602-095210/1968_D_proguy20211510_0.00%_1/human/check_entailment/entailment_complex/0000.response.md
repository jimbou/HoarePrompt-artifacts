Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the given permutation and array of integers. The program first checks if the maximum value in the array is at the starting position of either player. If it is, that player wins. If not, it simulates the game for each player, keeping track of their scores at each position. It then calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering all possible moves and prints the winner.

The program correctly handles the case where the maximum value in the array is at the starting position of one of the players, and it correctly simulates the game for each player. It also correctly calculates the maximum possible score for each player and prints the winner.

Correctness: **True**
