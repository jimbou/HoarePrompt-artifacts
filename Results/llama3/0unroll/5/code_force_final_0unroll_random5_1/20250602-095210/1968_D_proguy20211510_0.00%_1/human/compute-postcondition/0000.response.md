Output State: **YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S, followed by a list of n integers representing the permutation p, and another list of n integers representing the array a. n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, P_B and P_S are positive integers less than or equal to n. The permutation p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. The array a is a list of positive integers.**

The code defines four variables: `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha`. The values of `YES` and `NO` are assigned as strings 'YES' and 'NO' respectively. The value of `MOD` is calculated as 10 to the power of 9 plus 7, resulting in 1000000007. The value of `alpha` is assigned as a string of all lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The state of stdin and the variables n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a remains unchanged as the code does not modify them.
