Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The program iterates through each test case, processing the input data, and then determines the winner of the game based on the scores calculated.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by defining some constants (YES, NO, MOD, alpha) that are not used in the given code snippet. These constants seem to be leftovers from a different problem or a template.
2.  It then reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
3.  For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation (n), the duration of the game (k), Bodya's starting position (pb), and Sasha's starting position (ps).
4.  The program then reads the permutation (p) and the array (a) as input.
5.  It finds the maximum value in the array (maxa) and checks if both Bodya and Sasha start at the maximum value. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
6.  If only one of them starts at the maximum value, it prints the corresponding winner's name and continues to the next test case.
7.  If neither of them starts at the maximum value, the program simulates the game for both players. It keeps track of the scores for each player at each turn and stores them in lists (b and s).
8.  The program then calculates the prefix sums of the scores for both players (preb and pres) and the total scores for each turn (ptsb and ptss).
9.  Finally, it compares the maximum total scores for both players and prints the winner's name based on the comparison.

Correctness: **True**
