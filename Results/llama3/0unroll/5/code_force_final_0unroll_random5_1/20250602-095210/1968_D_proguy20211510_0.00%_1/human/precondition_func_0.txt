stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S, followed by a list of n integers representing the permutation p, and another list of n integers representing the array a. n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, P_B and P_S are positive integers less than or equal to n. The permutation p is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. The array a is a list of positive integers.
