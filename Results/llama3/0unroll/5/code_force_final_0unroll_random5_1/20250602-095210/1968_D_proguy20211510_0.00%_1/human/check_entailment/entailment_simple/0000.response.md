Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the maximum value in the array `a` is present at both `pb` and `ps` positions. If yes, it prints 'Draw' because both players will have the same score.

2. If the maximum value is present at only one of the positions, it prints the corresponding player's name because that player will have a higher score.

3. If the maximum value is not present at either of the positions, it simulates the game for `k` turns. It keeps track of the scores of both players and the positions they move to in each turn.

4. After simulating the game, it calculates the total score for each player by adding the scores of all turns and the remaining turns (if any) multiplied by the maximum value.

5. Finally, it compares the total scores of both players and prints the corresponding result.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, and its logic is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
