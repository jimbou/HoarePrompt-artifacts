Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on a given permutation and array of integers. The function takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) followed by a permutation p and an array a. The function calculates the maximum score for each player and prints the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case.**
