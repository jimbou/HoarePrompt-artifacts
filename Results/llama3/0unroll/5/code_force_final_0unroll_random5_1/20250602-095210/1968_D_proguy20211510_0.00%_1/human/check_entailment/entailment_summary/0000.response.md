Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given permutation and array of integers. The program first checks if the maximum score is achieved by both players at the same position, in which case it's a draw. Then it checks if the maximum score is achieved by Bodya or Sasha at their respective starting positions, in which case the corresponding player wins. If neither of these conditions is met, the program simulates the game for k turns, keeping track of the maximum score achieved by each player at each turn. Finally, it compares the maximum scores achieved by both players and prints the winner.

Correctness: **True**
