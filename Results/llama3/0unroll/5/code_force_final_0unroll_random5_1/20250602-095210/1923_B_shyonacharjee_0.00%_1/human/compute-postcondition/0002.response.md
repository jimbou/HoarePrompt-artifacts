Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and k, followed by n integers representing healths and n integers representing positions. It then determines whether it is possible to kill all monsters in each test case without running out of bullets, based on the given healths and positions, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console for each test case, indicating the result.**
