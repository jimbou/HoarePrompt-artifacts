Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum distance between each pair of cities (x_i, y_i) and prints the result.

The program first initializes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, to store the cumulative distances from the start and end of the list of cities, respectively. It then calculates these cumulative distances by iterating over the list of cities from start to end and from end to start, respectively.

For each query, the program calculates the minimum distance between the two cities by comparing the cumulative distances from the start and end of the list. It subtracts the cumulative distance at the start city from the cumulative distance at the end city to get the distance from start to end, and vice versa. It then prints the minimum of these two distances.

The program correctly handles the case where the start city is less than the end city and the case where the start city is greater than the end city. It also correctly handles the case where the start and end cities are the same.

The time complexity of the program is O(n + m), where n is the number of cities and m is the number of queries. This is because the program iterates over the list of cities once to calculate the cumulative distances, and then iterates over the list of queries once to calculate the minimum distances.

The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the number of cities. This is because the program uses two dictionaries to store the cumulative distances, each of which has n entries.

Correctness: **True**
