Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of unique integers representing cities and a list of pairs of cities. It calculates the minimum distance between each pair of cities and prints the result. The function iterates through the list of cities in both ascending and descending order, calculating the minimum distance between each city and its closest neighbor. It then uses these calculations to determine the minimum distance between each pair of cities. The function prints the minimum distance for each pair of cities and repeats this process for all test cases.**
