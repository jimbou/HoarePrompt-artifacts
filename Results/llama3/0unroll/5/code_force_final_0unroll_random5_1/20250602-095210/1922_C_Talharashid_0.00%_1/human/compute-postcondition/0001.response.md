Output State: The loop will execute for 't' number of times, where 't' is the number of test cases. For each test case, it will calculate the minimum distance between each pair of cities and print the result. The state of the variables 't', 'n', 'lst', 'm', 'x_i', and 'y_i' will remain unchanged. The variables 'd1' and 'd2' will be reset for each test case. The output will be the minimum distance between each pair of cities for each test case.
