Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: an integer n, a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and an integer m followed by m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are in ascending order, and for each city i, there is a unique closest city j. The integers x_i and y_i are between 1 and n (inclusive) and are not equal.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is an integer that was read from the input, and the remaining test cases in the input are unchanged. The integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are still in ascending order, and for each city i, there is still a unique closest city j. The integers x_i and y_i are still between 1 and n (inclusive) and are not equal.
