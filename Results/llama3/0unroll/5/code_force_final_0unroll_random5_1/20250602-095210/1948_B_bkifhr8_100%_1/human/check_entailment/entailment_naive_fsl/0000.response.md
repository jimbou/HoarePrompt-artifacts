Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the array has more than two elements and the operation needs to be applied multiple times. The current implementation only checks if the operation can be applied to the previous element to make the array sorted, but it does not consider the case where the operation needs to be applied to an element that is not the previous one.

For example, consider the array [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2] and then check if the array [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] is sorted. However, it will not consider the case where the operation needs to be applied to the element 45 to make the array sorted.

A correct implementation would need to consider all possible applications of the operation and check if the resulting array is sorted.
