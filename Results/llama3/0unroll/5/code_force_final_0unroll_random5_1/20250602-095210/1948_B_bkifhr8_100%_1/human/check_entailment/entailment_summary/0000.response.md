Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by applying the specified operation any number of times. The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, and whenever it encounters a pair of elements that are not in non-decreasing order, it checks if the previous element can be split into digits to form a sorted sequence. If it can, the program updates the previous element with the smallest digit; otherwise, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the array can be sorted and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
