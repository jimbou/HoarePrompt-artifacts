Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly replacing an element with its digits. The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, and for each pair of elements that are in the wrong order, it checks if replacing the previous element with its digits would result in a sorted array. If it does, it updates the previous element with the smallest digit; otherwise, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop.

The program handles all possible cases, including when the array is already sorted, when the array can be sorted by replacing elements with their digits, and when the array cannot be sorted. The use of the `sorted` function to check if the array is sorted is also correct.

The output of the program matches the expected output for the given examples, and the program consumes the input as expected.

Correctness: **True**
