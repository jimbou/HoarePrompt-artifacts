The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99). Since the code only reads one integer from the input, the value of `n` will be the first integer in the input, which is `t`. The remaining input will still be in the stdin.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99).**
