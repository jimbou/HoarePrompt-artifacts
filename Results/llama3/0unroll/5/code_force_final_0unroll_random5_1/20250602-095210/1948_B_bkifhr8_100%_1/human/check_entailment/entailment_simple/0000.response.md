Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements `arr`.
3. It initializes a flag `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.
4. It iterates over the array from the second last element to the first element (in reverse order). For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, it means that the array is not sorted.
5. If the array is not sorted, it tries to split the previous element into its digits and inserts them into the array. It then checks if the resulting array is sorted. If it is not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
6. Finally, it prints `YES` if `ans` is `True` and `NO` otherwise.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly implements the given operation and checks for the sortedness of the array after each operation. It also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the array is already sorted or when the operation cannot make the array sorted.

Correctness: **True**
