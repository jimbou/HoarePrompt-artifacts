Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly generates an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences.

The program works by iteratively appending either the maximum or minimum possible value to the array, depending on whether X is even or odd. This process is repeated until X becomes 1. The resulting array is then reversed and printed.

The key insight here is that appending the maximum value to the array doubles the number of increasing subsequences, while appending the minimum value increases the number of increasing subsequences by 1. By cleverly choosing which value to append at each step, the program is able to construct an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore I conclude that the program is correct.
