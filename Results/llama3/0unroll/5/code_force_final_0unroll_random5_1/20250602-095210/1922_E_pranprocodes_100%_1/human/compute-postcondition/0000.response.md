Output State: **The output state will contain the number of test cases (an integer) followed by a sequence of integers representing the number of operations (t) and the sequence of numbers (ans) for each test case. The sequence of numbers (ans) will be in reverse order, with the first number being the maximum or minimum value (depending on whether the input X is even or odd) and the subsequent numbers being the result of the operations performed on X. The state of the other variables (stdin, max, min) remains unchanged.**
