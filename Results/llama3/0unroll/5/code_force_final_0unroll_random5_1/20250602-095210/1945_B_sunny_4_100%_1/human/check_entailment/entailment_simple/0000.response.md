Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by dividing the time the firework is visible (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), and adding 2.

However, the addition of 2 is incorrect. The correct calculation should only add 1 to account for the fact that the fireworks are visible for m+1 minutes. The correct formula should be:

ans = m // a + m // b + 1

The given program adds 2 instead of 1, which means it overcounts the number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Correctness: **False**
