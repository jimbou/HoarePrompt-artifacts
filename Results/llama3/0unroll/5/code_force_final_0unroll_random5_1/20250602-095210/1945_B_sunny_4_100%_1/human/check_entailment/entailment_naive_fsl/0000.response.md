Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

For example, when the input is 1 1 1, the program outputs 4, but the correct output should be 3. This is because when a = b = 1, the fireworks are launched every minute, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes (m + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2). Therefore, at any given time, there can be at most 3 fireworks visible in the sky (the one launched in the current minute, the one launched in the previous minute, and the one launched 2 minutes ago).

The program's mistake is in the line `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`, where it adds 2 to the sum of `m // a` and `m // b`. This is incorrect because it assumes that there will always be at least 2 additional fireworks visible in the sky, which is not the case when a = b = 1.
