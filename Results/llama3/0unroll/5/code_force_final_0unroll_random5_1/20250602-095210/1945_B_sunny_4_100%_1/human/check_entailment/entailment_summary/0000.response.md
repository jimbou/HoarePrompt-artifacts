Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect because it adds 2 to the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and m by b. This is incorrect because the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time is simply the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and m by b, without adding 2.

Correctness: **False**
