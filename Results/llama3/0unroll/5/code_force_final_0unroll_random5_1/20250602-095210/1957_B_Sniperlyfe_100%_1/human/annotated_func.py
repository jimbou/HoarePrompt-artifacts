#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that n <= 2*10^5 and k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 and the rest are 1.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of n integers, where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k and the rest are 1. Since k is 0, the first element is (1 << 0.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + 0 = 0. The list contains n-1 ones after the first element.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates a list of n integers, where the first element is the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits minus 1, and the rest are 1. The function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where n is the length of the output list and k is the number of bits available to represent the first element. The function returns a list of n integers, where the first element is the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits minus 1, and the rest are 1. If k is 0, the first element is 0. The function ensures that the sum of all elements in the list does not exceed k.
