Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is 0, nums is a list of n integers where the first element is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k and the rest are 1.**

In this output state, the value of `nums[0]` has been updated by adding `k` to it. Since `k` is 0, the value of `nums[0]` remains the same, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The rest of the elements in the `nums` list remain unchanged, which are all 1. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by the code and remain the same.
