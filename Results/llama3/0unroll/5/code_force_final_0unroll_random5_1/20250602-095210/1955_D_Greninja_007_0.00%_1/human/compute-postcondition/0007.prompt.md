You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, k is an integer, n and m are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i in range(n), and 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i in range(m).
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    matches = sum(min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in
    b_freq)
    for i in range(n - m):
        if matches >= k:
            good_subarrays += 1
        
        if a[i] in b_freq:
            matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])
        
        window_freq[a[i]] -= 1
        
        if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:
            del window_freq[a[i]]
        
        if a[i + m] in b_freq:
            matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])
        
        window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: good_subarrays is the number of subarrays of length m in list a that have at least k matches with list b, matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both window_freq and b_freq after the last iteration of the loop, window_freq contains the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of list a, and the values of n, m, k, a, and b_freq remain unchanged.
    if (matches >= k) :
        good_subarrays += 1
    #State: *good_subarrays is the number of subarrays of length m in list a that have at least k matches with list b, matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both window_freq and b_freq after the last iteration of the loop, window_freq contains the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of list a, and the values of n, m, k, a, and b_freq remain unchanged. If matches is greater than or equal to k, good_subarrays is increased by 1.
    return good_subarrays
    #The program returns the number of subarrays of length m in list a that have at least k matches with list b.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of subarrays of length m in list a that have at least k matches with list b.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
