Postcondition: ***good_subarrays is the number of subarrays of length m in list a that have at least k matches with list b, matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both window_freq and b_freq after the last iteration of the loop, window_freq contains the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of list a, and the values of n, m, k, a, and b_freq remain unchanged. If matches is greater than or equal to k, good_subarrays is increased by 1.***
