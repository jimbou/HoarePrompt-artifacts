Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, k is an integer, n and m are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= a_i <= 10^6 for all i in range(n), and 1 <= b_i <= 10^6 for all i in range(m), good_subarrays is 0, b_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in list b, window_freq is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in the first m elements of list a, and matches is the sum of the minimum frequency of each integer in both window_freq and b_freq.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if matches >= k:
        good_subarrays += 1
    if a[i] in b_freq:
        matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])
    window_freq[a[i]] -= 1
    if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:
        del window_freq[a[i]]
    if a[i + m] in b_freq:
        matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])
    window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
