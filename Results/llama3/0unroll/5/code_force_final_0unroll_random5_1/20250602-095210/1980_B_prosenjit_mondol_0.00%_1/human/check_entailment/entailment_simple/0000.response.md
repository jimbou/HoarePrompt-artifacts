Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.

2. It correctly adjusts the index `f` to zero-based indexing by subtracting 1.

3. It correctly sorts the list of cube values `a` in non-increasing order.

4. It correctly identifies the value of Dmitry's favorite cube `x` and its position in the sorted list.

5. The program's logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed is correct:
   - If the value of the cube at position `k` is greater than `x`, the favorite cube will not be removed, so it prints 'NO'.
   - If the value of the cube at position `k` is less than `x`, the favorite cube will be removed, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If the value of the cube at position `k` is equal to `x`, the program checks if `k` is the last position or if the value of the cube at position `k-1` is less than `x`. If either condition is true, the favorite cube will be removed, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Correctness: **True**
