Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the cube at the k-th position after sorting. In this case, the program should print "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may be removed or left, depending on its original position. However, the program prints "YES" in this case, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input is:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

The program will print "YES", but the correct output should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube (with value 3) may be removed or left, depending on its original position.
