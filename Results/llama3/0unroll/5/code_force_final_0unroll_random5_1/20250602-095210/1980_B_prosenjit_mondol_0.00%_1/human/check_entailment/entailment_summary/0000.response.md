Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left. 

The program first reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of cubes (n), the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (f), and the number of removed cubes (k). It then reads the values shown on the cubes (a). 

The program sorts the values in descending order and compares the value of the favorite cube (x) with the k-th largest value in the sorted list (a[k]). 

If the k-th largest value is greater than the value of the favorite cube, it prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite cube will not be removed in any case. 

If the k-th largest value is less than the value of the favorite cube, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed in all cases. 

If the k-th largest value is equal to the value of the favorite cube, it checks if k is the last index or the (k-1)-th largest value is less than the value of the favorite cube. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed in all cases. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE', indicating that the favorite cube may be either removed or left. 

The program repeats this process for each test case and prints the results to the console.

Correctness: **True**
