stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a list of one or more pairs of integers, and finally a list of one or more integers. The first integer is the length of the list of integers. The list of pairs of integers contains the left and right borders of the subarray. The list of integers contains the elements of the array. Each element of the array is greater than 0.
