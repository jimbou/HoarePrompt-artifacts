Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray can be transformed into a "good" array as per the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program correctly calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the list minus the index for each prefix of the list. This is done using the `ones` and `sum` arrays, respectively.

2. For each query, the program correctly calculates the number of 1's and the sum of the subarray within the given borders. This is done by subtracting the corresponding values from the `ones` and `sum` arrays.

3. The program then checks whether the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array by checking the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`. This condition is derived from the problem description and is correct.

4. If the condition is true, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior.

Correctness: **True**
