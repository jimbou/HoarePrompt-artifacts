Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of each test case is the length of the list and the second integer is the number of queries. The list contains integers greater than 0. The queries contain two integers each, representing the borders of a subarray, and are 1-indexed. The sum of the lengths of the lists over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The variable ones is a list of integers where each element at index i represents the count of 1's in the first i elements of the list nums. The variable sum is a list of integers where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the list nums minus i.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable ones is a list of integers where each element at index i represents the count of 1's in the first i elements of the list nums. The variable sum is a list of integers where each element at index i represents the sum of the first i elements of the list nums minus i.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers and a series of queries. It calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the list minus the index for each prefix of the list. Then, for each query, it determines whether a subarray within the given borders can be transformed into a list of consecutive integers starting from 1 by replacing some elements with 1, and prints 'YES' if possible and 'NO' otherwise.
