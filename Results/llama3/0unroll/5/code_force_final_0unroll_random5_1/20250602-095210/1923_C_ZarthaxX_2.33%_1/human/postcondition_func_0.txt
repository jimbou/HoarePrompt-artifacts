This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers and a series of queries. It calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the list minus the index for each prefix of the list. Then, for each query, it determines whether a subarray within the given borders can be transformed into a list of consecutive integers starting from 1 by replacing some elements with 1, and prints 'YES' if possible and 'NO' otherwise.
