Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`.

2.  The program initializes two lists: `ones` and `sum`. The `ones` list keeps track of the cumulative count of 1's in the array `nums`, and the `sum` list keeps track of the cumulative sum of the array `nums` minus the index.

3.  For each query, the program reads the left and right boundaries `l` and `r` of the subarray. If `l` is equal to `r`, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good.

4.  Otherwise, it calculates the number of 1's in the subarray (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray (`sumInRange`).

5.  The program then checks if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the number of 1's in the subarray plus the length of the subarray minus the number of 1's in the subarray. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

6.  The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is derived from the problem constraints. The left-hand side represents the minimum sum required to make the subarray good (i.e., all elements are greater than 0 and different from the original array), and the right-hand side represents the available sum in the subarray.

7.  The time complexity of the program is O(n + q), where n is the length of the array and q is the number of queries. This is because the program iterates over the array once to calculate the `ones` and `sum` lists, and then iterates over the queries once to answer each query.

8.  The space complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because the program uses two lists of length n + 1 to store the cumulative counts and sums.

Correctness: **True**
