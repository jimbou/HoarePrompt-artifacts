stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of each test case is the length of the list and the second integer is the number of queries. The list contains integers greater than 0. The queries contain two integers each, representing the borders of a subarray, and are 1-indexed. The sum of the lengths of the lists over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
