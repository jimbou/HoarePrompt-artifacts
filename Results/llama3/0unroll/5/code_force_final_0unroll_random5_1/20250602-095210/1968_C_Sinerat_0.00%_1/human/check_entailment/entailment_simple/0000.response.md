Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input as described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the elements `x_2, ..., x_n`.

2. The program initializes an array `a` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. The program sets the first element of `a` to 500, which is a valid value according to the problem statement (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

4. The program then iterates over the elements of `x` starting from the second element (index 1). For each element `x_i`, it calculates the corresponding element `a_i` as `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`, which is the condition specified in the problem statement.

5. Finally, the program prints the elements of `a`, which are the values that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
