Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find any array a_1, ..., a_n that satisfies the given conditions. The program initializes the first element of the array a as 500, which is within the allowed range of 1 to 10^9. Then, for each subsequent element, it calculates the value as the sum of the corresponding element in the input array x and the previous element in the array a. This ensures that the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} is satisfied for all 2 <= i <= n. The program also handles multiple test cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
