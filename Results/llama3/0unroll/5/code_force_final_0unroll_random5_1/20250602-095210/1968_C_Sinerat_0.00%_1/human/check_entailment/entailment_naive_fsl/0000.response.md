Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the conditions `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`.

The program initializes the first element of `a` to 500, which is within the allowed range of `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. Then, for each subsequent element `a_i`, it calculates the value as `a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}`, which ensures that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` holds true.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where `n` is 2 or `x_i` is 1. The output for the provided example inputs also matches the expected output.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
