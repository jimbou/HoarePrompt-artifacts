This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n-1 integers. It then generates a sequence of n integers, where each integer is the sum of the corresponding integer in the input sequence and the previous integer in the output sequence, starting with 500. The function prints each generated sequence.
