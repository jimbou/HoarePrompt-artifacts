Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n-1 integers. It then generates a sequence of n integers, where each integer is the sum of the corresponding integer in the input sequence and the previous integer in the output sequence, starting with 500. This is in line with the problem description, which requires finding any array a_1, ..., a_n that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required conditions. Specifically:

*   It initializes the first element of the output sequence (a_1) to 500, which is within the allowed range of 1 to 10^9.
*   For each subsequent element (a_i), it calculates the value as the sum of the corresponding input element (x_i) and the previous output element (a_{i-1}). This ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, as required by the problem.
*   The program prints each generated sequence, which is the expected output format.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
