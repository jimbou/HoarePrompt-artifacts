Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly because it is not resetting the variable "soma" to 0 after each test case. This means that the sum of the numbers for each test case is being added to the sum of the previous test cases, resulting in incorrect output.

For example, if the input is:

7
12
1
2
3
1434
2024
200000

The program will output:

51
52
55
61
18426
46296
4628298

Instead of the correct output:

51
1
3
6
18465
28170
4600002

The program should reset the variable "soma" to 0 after each test case to get the correct output.
