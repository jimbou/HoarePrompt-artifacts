Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number `n`.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `i`, which ranges from 0 to `n-1` (due to the `range(n)` in the outer loop). But the problem statement requires the sum of the digits of the numbers from 1 to `n`, inclusive.

The correct implementation should call `func_1` with the argument `i+1`, so that it ranges from 1 to `n`. 

Additionally, the program is printing the cumulative sum of the results for all test cases, instead of printing the result for each test case separately.

Correctness: **False**
