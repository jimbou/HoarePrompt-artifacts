Output State: **b is a string of lowercase Latin letters, char_map is an empty dictionary**.

The code defines a function to decode a given string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. However, the function is not executed in this code snippet. The only action taken is the creation of an empty dictionary called `char_map`. The initial state of `b` as a string of lowercase Latin letters remains unchanged.
