Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to decode a string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. The decoding process involves replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.

The function `func_1(b)` correctly implements this decoding process. It first creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r`. The characters in `r` are assigned based on their frequency in `b`, with the most frequent character mapped to 'a', the second most frequent to 'b', and so on.

The function then iterates over each character `c` in `b` and replaces it with its corresponding character in `char_map`. The resulting string `s` is the decoded original string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
