Decodes a given string of lowercase Latin letters by replacing each character with a corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' based on the frequency of the characters in the original string, with the most frequent character mapped to 'a', the second most frequent to 'b', and so on, returning the decoded string while keeping the mapping unchanged.
