Reasoning:

1. The problem requires decoding a given string `b` by restoring the original string `s`. The decoding process involves replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `s` in alphabetical order.

2. The provided program defines a function `func_1(b)` that takes the encoded string `b` as input and returns the decoded string `s`.

3. Inside `func_1(b)`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to store the mapping between each character in `b` and its corresponding symmetric character in `r`. The dictionary is populated by iterating over the sorted set of characters in `b` and assigning each character its symmetric character based on its position in the sorted set.

4. The program then iterates over each character `c` in the input string `b` and appends its corresponding symmetric character from the `char_map` to the decoded string `s`.

5. Finally, the program prints the decoded string `s` for each test case.

6. The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It correctly constructs the `char_map` and uses it to replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character from `r`.

7. The program also handles the case where the input string `b` contains duplicate characters, as the `char_map` is populated based on the sorted set of characters in `b`, which removes duplicates.

8. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical flaws that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
