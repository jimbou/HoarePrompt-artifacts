Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t testcases. Each testcase consists of four lines, each line containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin still contains t testcases, each consisting of four lines with two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The values of the other variables are not affected.
