Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates and prints the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the corners of each square. The function does not modify the input value of t.**
