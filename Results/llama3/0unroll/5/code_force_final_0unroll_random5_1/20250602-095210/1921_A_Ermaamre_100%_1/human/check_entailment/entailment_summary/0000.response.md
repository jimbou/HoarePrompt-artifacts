Reasoning:

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the area of the square based on the given coordinates of its corners. The key insight is that the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, which means that the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (dx) represents the length of one side of the square. Since the area of a square is the square of its side length, the program correctly calculates the area by printing dx * dx.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases and the coordinates of the corners, and printing the area of each square.

Correctness: **True**
