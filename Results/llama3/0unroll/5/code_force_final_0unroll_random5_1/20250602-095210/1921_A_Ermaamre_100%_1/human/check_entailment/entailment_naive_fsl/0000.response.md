Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which represents the length of the side of the square. Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the length of the side is the same in both the x and y directions. Therefore, the area of the square is the square of the length of the side, which is calculated by multiplying the difference by itself.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the coordinates of the corners are given in random order, and cases where the square has a positive area. The program also correctly handles cases where the coordinates of the corners are negative, as long as the area of the square is positive.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
