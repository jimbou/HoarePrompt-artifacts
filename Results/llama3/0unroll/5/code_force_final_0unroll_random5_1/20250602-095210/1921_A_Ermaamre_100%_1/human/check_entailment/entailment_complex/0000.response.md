Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the corners of the square, which are guaranteed to be in random order.
3. The program correctly calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the corners, which represents the side length of the square.
4. The program correctly calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length.
5. The program prints the area of the square for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. The comments provided also accurately describe the state of the program before and after the function call.

Correctness: **True**
