Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two zeros (0, 0)**

In this output state, the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `size_overlap` and assigned it a tuple value of (0, 0).
