Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array of integers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate the sequence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input test cases and the value of X for each test case.
2. The `func_1` function is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number. It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
3. The function starts by checking if the input number is 0. If it is, the function returns a tuple containing 0 and 0. This is a base case for the recursion.
4. If the input number is not 0, the function iterates over the range of possible values for the sequence, starting from the maximum value in the current sequence (or 0 if the sequence is empty) and decreasing by 1.
5. For each value `i` in this range, the function calculates the size `size` and value `value` of the sequence that would be generated if `i` were the next element in the sequence.
6. The function checks if the calculated `value` is less than or equal to the input number. If it is, the function sets `size_overlap` to the tuple `(size, i)` and breaks out of the loop.
7. The function then appends `size - overlap` elements to the sequence, starting from `i + overlap`.
8. The function recursively calls itself with the updated input number `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and the updated sequence.
9. The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the recursive function `func_1` to generate a sequence of numbers with exactly X increasing subsequences. The function uses a well-defined recursive approach to build the sequence, and the program correctly prints the length and the sequence itself.

However, it's worth noting that the program does not handle the case where X is 1 correctly. According to the problem statement, an empty subsequence is also considered an increasing subsequence, so the program should return an empty sequence for X = 1. But the program currently returns a sequence with a single element 0 for X = 1, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should add a special case to handle X = 1 and return an empty sequence in that case.
