Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two positive integers (size, i), `size` is a positive integer, `overlap` is a positive integer**

In this output state, the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged. The tuple `size_overlap` is unpacked into two separate variables `size` and `overlap`, which are both positive integers. The values of `size` and `overlap` are the same as the corresponding values in the `size_overlap` tuple.
