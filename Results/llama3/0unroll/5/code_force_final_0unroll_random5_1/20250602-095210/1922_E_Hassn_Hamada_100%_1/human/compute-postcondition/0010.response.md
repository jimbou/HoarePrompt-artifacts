Output State: **`number` is a positive integer, `sequence` is a list of integers with `size - overlap` additional elements appended to the end, each of which is an integer from `overlap` to `size - 1`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing two positive integers (size, i), `size` is a positive integer, `overlap` is a positive integer, and the function `func_1` has been called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.**

In this output state, the values of `number`, `sequence`, `size_overlap`, `size`, and `overlap` remain unchanged. However, the function `func_1` has been called with a new argument, which is calculated based on the values of `number`, `size`, and `overlap`. The argument passed to `func_1` is `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`, which is a new value that is not stored in any variable.
