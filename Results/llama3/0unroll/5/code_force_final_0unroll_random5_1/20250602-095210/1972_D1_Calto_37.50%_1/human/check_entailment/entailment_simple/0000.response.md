Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem that involves counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The conditions are:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The program uses two functions: `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and `func_2` to count the number of valid pairs.

In `func_2`, the program iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m-1`. For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` using the formulas `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. Then, it increments the count `cnt` by the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1 if `i` is greater than 1.

The program returns 1 if `cnt` is 0, and `cnt` otherwise.

The problem with this program is that it does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs. The conditions for a valid pair are not correctly implemented in the program.

Specifically, the program does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it uses a formula that is not related to the problem conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
