Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, which is necessary for the second condition. However, it is not used in the provided code.

Function 2 calculates a value based on the input parameters n and m. It iterates over the range from 1 to m-1 and calculates the sum of integer divisions of n - (i * i - i) by i * i plus the number of iterations i greater than 1. If the calculated count cnt is 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated count cnt.

The problem statement does not explicitly mention the use of the GCD in the calculation, but it is implied in the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The provided code does not use the GCD function (func_1) in the calculation, which raises concerns about the correctness of the program.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the calculation in func_2 is actually correct and does not require the explicit use of the GCD function. The calculation x // y + (i > 1) effectively counts the number of pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions, without needing to explicitly calculate the GCD.

Therefore, despite the initial concerns, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
