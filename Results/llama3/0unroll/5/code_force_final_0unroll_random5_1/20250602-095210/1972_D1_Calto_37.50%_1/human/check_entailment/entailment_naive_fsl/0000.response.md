Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the function `func_2(n, m)`. The loop only iterates up to `m-1`, but it should iterate up to `m` because the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. This means that the program is missing the case where `b` is equal to `m`.

For example, when `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program will not consider the pair `(10, 8)` which satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the program will not count this pair and will produce an incorrect result.

To fix this issue, the loop in `func_2(n, m)` should be modified to iterate up to `m` instead of `m-1`.
