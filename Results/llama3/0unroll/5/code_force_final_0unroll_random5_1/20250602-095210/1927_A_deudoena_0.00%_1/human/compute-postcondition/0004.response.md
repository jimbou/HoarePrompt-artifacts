Output State: The loop iterates over the string inpstr, which is a positive integer t. For each character j in inpstr, it checks if j is equal to 'B'. If it is, it sets ind2 to the index i of that character and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, after the loop executes all the iterations, ind2 will be set to the index of the first 'B' character in inpstr, and ind1 and outind will remain unchanged at 0.
