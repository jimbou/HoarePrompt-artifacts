You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+2t lines, where t is a positive integer. The first line contains a positive integer t. The next 2t lines are organized in t groups of two lines. The first line of each group contains a positive integer n. The second line of each group contains a string of length n, consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over the string inpstr, which is a positive integer t. For each character j in inpstr, it checks if j is equal to 'B'. If it is, it sets ind1 to the index i of that character and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, after the loop executes all the iterations, ind1 will be set to the index of the first 'B' character in inpstr, and ind2 and outind will remain unchanged at 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over the string inpstr, which is a positive integer t. For each character j in inpstr, it checks if j is equal to 'B'. If it is, it sets ind2 to the index i of that character and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, after the loop executes all the iterations, ind2 will be set to the index of the first 'B' character in inpstr, and ind1 and outind will remain unchanged at 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: the length of the string inpstr minus the index of the first 'B' character in inpstr minus 0

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
