Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop iterates over the string inpstr, which is a positive integer t. For each character j in inpstr, it checks if j is equal to 'B'. If it is, it sets ind1 to the index i of that character and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, after the loop executes all the iterations, ind1 will be set to the index of the first 'B' character in inpstr, and ind2 and outind will remain unchanged at 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(inpstr)):
    if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
        ind2 = i
        break


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
