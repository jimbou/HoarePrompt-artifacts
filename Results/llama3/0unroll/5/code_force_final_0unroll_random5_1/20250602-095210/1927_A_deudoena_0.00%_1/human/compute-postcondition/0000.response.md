Output State: **stdin contains 2t lines, where t is a positive integer. The next 2t lines are organized in t groups of two lines. The first line of each group contains a positive integer n. The second line of each group contains a string of length n, consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. inpstr is a positive integer t, ind1 is 0, ind2 is 0, outind is 0.**

The code reads the first line from stdin, which contains a positive integer t, and assigns it to inpstr. The remaining 2t lines in stdin are left unchanged, still organized in t groups of two lines, with each group containing a positive integer n and a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters. The variables ind1, ind2, and outind are initialized to 0.
