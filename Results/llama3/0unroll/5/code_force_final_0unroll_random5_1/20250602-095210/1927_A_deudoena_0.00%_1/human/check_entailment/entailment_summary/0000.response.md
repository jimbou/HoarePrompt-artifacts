Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly finds the indices of the first and last 'B' characters in the input string and prints the length of the substring between these two indices (inclusive), which is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white.

Correctness: **True**
