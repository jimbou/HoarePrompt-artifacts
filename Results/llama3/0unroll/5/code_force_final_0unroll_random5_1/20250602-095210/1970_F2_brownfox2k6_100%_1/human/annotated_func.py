#State of the program right berfore the function call: obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, and d is a string representing the direction of movement, which can be 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), or 'R' (right).

If the direction of movement `d` is 'R' (right), the y-coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1, while the x-coordinate remains the same. If `d` is not 'R' (right), the coordinates of `obj` remain unchanged. In all cases, `d` is not 'L' (left), 'D' (down) or 'U' (up).

#Overall this is what the function does:Moves an object on a field in a specified direction. The function takes a list of two integers representing the object's coordinates and a string representing the direction of movement ('U' for up, 'D' for down, 'L' for left, or 'R' for right). It updates the object's coordinates based on the direction: moving up decreases the x-coordinate by 1, moving down increases the x-coordinate by 1, moving left decreases the y-coordinate by 1, and moving right increases the y-coordinate by 1. The function returns the updated coordinates.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer representing the current time in the game, player is a dictionary where the keys are player identifiers (strings) and the values are lists of two integers representing the player's position on the field, blud is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field.
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is the state of the program after the loop has finished executing. In this case, the loop iterates over each player in the `player` dictionary. If the player's position is the same as the Bludger's position, the player's identifier is added to the `out` list and the player's position is set to `[-1, -1]`. The `t` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is the state of the program after the loop has finished executing. In this case, the loop iterates over each player in the `out` list in sorted order. For each player, it prints the value of `t`, the player's identifier, and the string 'ELIMINATED'. The `t` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:Identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger, updating their positions and printing elimination messages with the current time.
