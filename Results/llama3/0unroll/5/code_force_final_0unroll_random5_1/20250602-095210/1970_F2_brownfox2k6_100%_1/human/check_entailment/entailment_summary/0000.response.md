Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to simulate a Quidditch game between two teams, Gryffindor (R) and Ravenclaw (B). The program takes input from the user, including the size of the field, the initial positions of the players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger, and the actions to be performed by the entities on the field.

The program correctly implements the rules of the game, including player movement, catching and throwing the Quaffle, scoring goals, and eliminating players who come into contact with the Bludger. The program also correctly updates the positions of the entities on the field and prints the main events of the game, including goals scored and players eliminated.

The two functions, func_1 and func_2, are correctly implemented to move objects on the field and eliminate players who are in the same position as the Bludger, respectively.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
