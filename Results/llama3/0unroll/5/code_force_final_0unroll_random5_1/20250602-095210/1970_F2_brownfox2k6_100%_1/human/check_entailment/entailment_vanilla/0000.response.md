Reasoning:

The provided program appears to be a part of a larger program designed to simulate a game of Quidditch. The two functions provided, `func_1` and `func_2`, seem to be responsible for updating the position of objects on the field and handling player elimination, respectively.

`func_1` takes an object's current position and a direction as input, and updates the object's position accordingly. This function seems to be correct, as it properly handles the four possible directions (up, down, left, and right).

`func_2` takes a time step `t` as input and checks if any players are at the same position as the Bludger. If a player is found to be at the same position as the Bludger, they are eliminated and their position is updated to `[-1, -1]`. The function then prints out the eliminated players in alphabetical order. This function also seems to be correct, as it properly handles player elimination and prints out the eliminated players in the correct order.

However, there are a few potential issues with the program. For example, the `player` and `blud` variables are not defined in the provided code, so it is unclear what these variables represent or how they are initialized. Additionally, the program does not seem to handle the case where a player scores a goal, which is an important part of the game.

Overall, based on the provided code, it appears that the program is mostly correct, but there may be some issues with the larger program that are not apparent from the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
