Correctness: **False** 

The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality. It appears to be a part of a larger program, but it lacks the main logic for simulating the game and determining the winner. 

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not show how these functions are used in the context of the game. The `func_1` function seems to be responsible for moving an object on the field, while the `func_2` function appears to handle the elimination of players. However, the program does not provide the necessary logic for simulating the game, such as handling player movements, catching and throwing the Quaffle, and scoring goals.

Additionally, the program does not define the variables `player` and `blud`, which are used in the `func_2` function. It also does not provide the necessary input/output handling, such as reading the game configuration and printing the final score.

Therefore, the provided program is incomplete and does not correctly implement the required functionality.
