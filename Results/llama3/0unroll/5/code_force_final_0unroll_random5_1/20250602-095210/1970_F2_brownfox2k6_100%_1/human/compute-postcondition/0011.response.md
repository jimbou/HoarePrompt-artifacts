Postcondition: ***`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field. If the direction of movement `d` is 'R' (right), the y-coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1, while the x-coordinate remains the same. If `d` is not 'R' (right), the coordinates of `obj` remain unchanged. In all cases, `d` is not 'L' (left), 'D' (down) or 'U' (up).***
