Moves an object on a field in a specified direction. The function takes a list of two integers representing the object's coordinates and a string representing the direction of movement ('U' for up, 'D' for down, 'L' for left, or 'R' for right). It updates the object's coordinates based on the direction: moving up decreases the x-coordinate by 1, moving down increases the x-coordinate by 1, moving left decreases the y-coordinate by 1, and moving right increases the y-coordinate by 1. The function returns the updated coordinates.
