The code `obj[1] -= 1` decrements the second element of the `obj` list by 1. Since `obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, this means that the y-coordinate of the object is decreased by 1.

The value of `d` is not affected by this code, so it remains 'L' (left).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, where the y-coordinate is decreased by 1, and `d` is 'L' (left).**

In other words, the object has moved one step to the left on the field, and the direction of movement is still left.
