Postcondition: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field. If the direction of movement `d` is 'D' (down), the x-coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is 'L' (left), the y-coordinate of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R' (right), the y-coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is neither 'L' (left), 'R' (right), nor 'D' (down), the coordinates of `obj` remain unchanged.**
