Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when a player scores in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in the wrong goal, the other team wins a point. However, the program does not check for this condition and does not update the score accordingly.

For example, if the input is:

3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T

The program will output:

11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1

However, according to the problem description, the red player scored in the red goal, so the blue team should win a point. The correct output should be:

11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 0

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
