Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an object on the field, where the x-coordinate is the same as before and the y-coordinate is increased by 1, and `d` is 'R' (right), indicating the direction of movement, while previously `d` was not 'L' (left), 'D' (down) or 'U' (up).**

In this output state, the value of `obj[1]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a new y-coordinate for the object on the field. The value of `d` remains the same, indicating that the direction of movement is still to the right. The previous values of `d` are still valid, meaning it was not 'L', 'D', or 'U' before the code execution.
