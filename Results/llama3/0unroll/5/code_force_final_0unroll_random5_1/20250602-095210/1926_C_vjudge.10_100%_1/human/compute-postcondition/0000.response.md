Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: a sequence of integers, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, values is a list of 2*10^5 + 1 zeros**

The first line assigns the value of `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` to `inf`. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`, which is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The third line creates a list of `inf` zeros and assigns it to `values`. Since `inf` is `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`, the list `values` has `2 * 10^5 + 1` zeros. The first input from stdin is consumed by the second line, leaving only the sequence of integers in stdin.
