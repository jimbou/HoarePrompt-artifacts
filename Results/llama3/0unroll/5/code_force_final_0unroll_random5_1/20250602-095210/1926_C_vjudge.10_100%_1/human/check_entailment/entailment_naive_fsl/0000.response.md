Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to precalculate the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5, and then uses this precalculated array to answer each test case in constant time.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the edge cases where n is 1, 2, or 3, as well as larger values of n. The program also correctly handles the case where n is equal to 2 * 10^5, which is the maximum possible value of n.

The program's time complexity is O(1) for each test case, which is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test. The program's space complexity is O(2 * 10^5), which is reasonable given the size of the input.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem for all potential cases.
