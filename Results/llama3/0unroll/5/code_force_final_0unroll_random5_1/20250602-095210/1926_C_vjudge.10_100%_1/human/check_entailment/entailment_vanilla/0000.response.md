Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.
2. The given program uses a precomputation approach to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 2 * 10^5 in an array `values`.
3. The program then reads the input `t` (the number of test cases) and for each test case, it reads an integer `value` and prints the corresponding cumulative sum from the `values` array.
4. The program uses a single loop to precompute the cumulative sums, which has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the maximum value (2 * 10^5). This is within the given time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.
5. The program uses a single array to store the cumulative sums, which has a space complexity of O(n). This is acceptable given the constraints of the problem.
6. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `value` is 1, 2, or 3, by using the precomputed cumulative sums.
7. The program does not have any obvious errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
