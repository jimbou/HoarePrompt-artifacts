The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of that length containing only 'U' and 'D' characters. It then checks each string to determine if the count of 'U' characters is odd or even, printing 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even. The function processes all test cases and produces a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs accordingly.
