Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The problem description states that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win. However, the program only checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. This is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

For example, consider the case where n = 4 and s = "UUDD". The program will print 'NO', but this is incorrect. The correct winner of the game in this case is Alice, because she can choose the first 'U' and flip the adjacent 'D's, leaving Bob with no 'U's to choose from.

The program does not take into account the actual moves that Alice and Bob can make, and only relies on the parity of the number of 'U's. This is not enough to determine the winner of the game, and therefore the program is incorrect.
