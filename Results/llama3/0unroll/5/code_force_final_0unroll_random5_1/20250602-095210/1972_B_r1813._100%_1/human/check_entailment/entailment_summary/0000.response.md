Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem requires determining who will win the game if both players play optimally. The key insight is that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win. The program correctly identifies that if the count of 'U' characters is odd, Alice will win, and if the count is even, Bob will win.

The program reads the input correctly, counts the number of 'U' characters in each string, and prints 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the example provided.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and produces the correct output based on the count of 'U' characters.

Correctness: **True**
