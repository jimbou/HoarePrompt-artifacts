Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of that length containing only 'U' and 'D' characters. It then checks each string to determine if the count of 'U' characters is odd or even, printing 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of the players will win. The key insight is that if the number of 'U' characters is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because Alice goes first, and she can always choose a 'U' character to remove and flip the adjacent characters. If there are an odd number of 'U' characters, Alice will always have a 'U' character to choose from, and she will win the game.

The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U' characters in each string and printing 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even.

Correctness: **True**
