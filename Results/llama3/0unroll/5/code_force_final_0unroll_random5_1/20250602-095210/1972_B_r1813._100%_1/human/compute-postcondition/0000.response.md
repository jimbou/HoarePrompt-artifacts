Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. t is an integer between 1 and 100, index is 2.**

The first line assigns the entire content of stdin to the variable `input`. The second line splits the content of `input` into a list of strings using whitespace as a delimiter and assigns it to the variable `data`. The third line converts the first element of `data` (which is an integer between 1 and 100) to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The fourth line sets the value of `index` to 2.

Note that the value of `stdin` is not explicitly mentioned in the output state, but it is implied that it contains multiple test cases minus one, since one test case has been read and processed.
