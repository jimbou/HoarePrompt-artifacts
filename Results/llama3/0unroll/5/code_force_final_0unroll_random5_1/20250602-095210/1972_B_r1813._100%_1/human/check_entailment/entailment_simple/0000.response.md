Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the coins.

2. The program correctly counts the number of 'U' coins in each string `s`: It uses the `count` method of the string to count the number of 'U' characters.

3. The program correctly determines who will win the game: According to the problem description, if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. The program correctly implements this logic.

4. The program correctly prints the output: It prints 'YES' if Alice will win and 'NO' if Bob will win.

5. The program correctly handles the loop: It iterates over each test case and prints the output for each case.

6. The program correctly handles the indexing: It correctly increments the index to read the next input for each test case.

7. The program correctly handles the termination: It correctly terminates after reading and processing all test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
