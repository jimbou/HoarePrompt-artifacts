Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. The program reads the input data, processes each test case, and calculates the last year of each test case.

The program's logic is correct. It initializes the last year with the periodicity of the first sign and then iterates over the remaining signs. For each sign, it calculates the next year by adding 1 to the last year, rounding up to the nearest multiple of the sign's periodicity, and assigns this value to the last year.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the input data from stdin, processes each test case, and writes the results to stdout.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The variable `func_1` is not defined anywhere in the code. It is likely that this is a function that is supposed to contain the main logic of the program, but it is not defined. This would cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

Assuming that the `func_1` function is defined elsewhere in the code and contains the main logic of the program, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
