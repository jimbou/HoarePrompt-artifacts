Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases `T`, the number of signs `n` for each test case, and the periodicities `a_i` of the signs.

2. For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` to the periodicity of the first sign `a_0`. This is because the first sign occurs in the year `a_0`.

3. The program then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second sign to the `n`-th sign). For each sign, it calculates the next year `next_year` when the sign will occur. This is done by adding 1 to `last_year` (because the tribe starts waiting for the next sign in the year after `last_year`), then rounding up to the nearest multiple of the sign's periodicity `a_i`. This is achieved by the expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.

4. The program updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

5. After processing all signs, the program appends the final `last_year` (which represents the year when the `n`-th sign occurs) to the `results` list.

6. Finally, the program writes the results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
