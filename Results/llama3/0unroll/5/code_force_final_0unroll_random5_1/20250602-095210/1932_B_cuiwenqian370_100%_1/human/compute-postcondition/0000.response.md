Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is 1, results is an empty list, data contains T test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), stdin is empty.**

The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is stored in the `data` variable. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `T`, which represents the number of test cases. The `index` variable is incremented to 1, pointing to the next element in the `data` list. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list. The remaining elements in `data` represent the test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The stdin is now empty since the entire input has been read.
