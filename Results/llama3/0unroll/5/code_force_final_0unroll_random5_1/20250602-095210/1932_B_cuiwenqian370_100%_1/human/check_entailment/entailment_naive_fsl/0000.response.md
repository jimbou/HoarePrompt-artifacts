Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, according to the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the input data correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of signs, and the periodicities of the signs.
2. The program initializes the `last_year` variable to the periodicity of the first sign, which is the year when the first sign occurs.
3. The program then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year when each sign will occur. This is done by adding 1 to the previous year, dividing by the periodicity of the current sign, rounding up to the nearest integer, and multiplying by the periodicity. This ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
4. The program updates the `last_year` variable to the calculated next year for each sign.
5. Finally, the program appends the last year to the `results` list, which is then printed out.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the periodicities of the signs are small (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...), the program correctly calculates the next year for each sign.
* When the periodicities of the signs are large (e.g., 1000, 2000, 3000, ...), the program correctly calculates the next year for each sign.
* When the number of signs is small (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...), the program correctly calculates the last year.
* When the number of signs is large (e.g., 100, 200, 300, ...), the program correctly calculates the last year.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible input cases.
