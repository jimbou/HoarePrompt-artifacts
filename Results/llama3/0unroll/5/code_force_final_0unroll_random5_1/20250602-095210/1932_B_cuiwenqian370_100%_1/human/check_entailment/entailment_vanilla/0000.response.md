Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the input data from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. The input data is split into a list of strings using the `split` method.

2. The program then reads the number of test cases `T` from the input data and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results of each test case.

3. The program then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a` from the input data.

4. The program initializes the `last_year` variable to the periodicity of the first sign `a[0]`.

5. The program then iterates over the remaining signs (from the second sign to the n-th sign). For each sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the last year.

6. The program updates the `last_year` variable to the calculated next year.

7. After iterating over all signs, the program appends the final `last_year` value to the `results` list.

8. Finally, the program writes the results of all test cases to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs.

Correctness: **True**
