Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of signs in each test case, and the periodicities of the signs.

2. The program initializes the `last_year` variable to the periodicity of the first sign, which is correct because the first sign occurs in its periodicity year.

3. The program then iterates over the remaining signs, calculating the next year in which each sign will occur. The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is correct because it rounds up the `last_year` to the next multiple of `a[i]`, which is the year in which the next sign will occur.

4. The program appends the final `last_year` to the `results` list, which is correct because this is the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

5. Finally, the program writes the results to standard output, one result per line, followed by a newline character, which is correct because this is the expected output format.

Correctness: **True**
