Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 1000, index is T + 1, results is a list of T strings, each string representing the last year of a test case, data contains T test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), the output of the program is the concatenation of all strings in results, separated by newline characters, followed by a newline character, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of T, index, results, and data remain unchanged. The code only writes the contents of the results list to the standard output, followed by a newline character. The output is a string that consists of the concatenation of all strings in results, separated by newline characters, and an additional newline character at the end.
