Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of cubes (n), the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (f), and the number of removed cubes (k).
2.  It correctly identifies the value of Dmitry's favorite cube by accessing the `f-1` index of the list `a`.
3.  The program accurately counts the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`) and the number of cubes with a greater value (`greater_count`).
4.  The program's logic for determining the outcome is correct:

    *   If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means that there are enough cubes with a greater value to fill the first `k` positions, so the favorite cube will definitely be removed. In this case, the program correctly prints 'YES'.
    *   If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that there are not enough cubes with a greater or equal value to fill the first `k` positions, so the favorite cube will definitely not be removed. In this case, the program correctly prints 'NO'.
    *   In all other cases, the favorite cube may be either removed or left, depending on the arrangement of the cubes. In this case, the program correctly prints 'MAYBE'.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
