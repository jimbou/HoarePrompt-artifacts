#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each execution, it will print either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the values of n, f, k, and the list a. The value of t will remain unchanged, and the values of n, f, k, and a will be updated for each iteration. The output will be a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' printed to the console, one for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from the standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result of each test case to the console. For each test case, it takes three integers (n, f, k) and a list of n integers as input, and then determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of f, k, and the list. The function prints 'YES' if the condition is met, 'NO' if it is not met, and 'MAYBE' if the condition is partially met. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases (t) and does not return any value.
