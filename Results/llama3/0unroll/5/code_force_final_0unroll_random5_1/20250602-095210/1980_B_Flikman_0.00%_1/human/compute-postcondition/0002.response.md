Functionality: **This function reads input from the standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result of each test case to the console. For each test case, it takes three integers (n, f, k) and a list of n integers as input, and then determines whether a certain condition is met based on the values of f, k, and the list. The function prints 'YES' if the condition is met, 'NO' if it is not met, and 'MAYBE' if the condition is partially met. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases (t) and does not return any value.**
