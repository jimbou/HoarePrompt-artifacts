Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains the test cases, each consisting of two lines as described in the initial state.
