Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3. It then reads the values shown on the cubes `a`.
4. It finds the value of Dmitry's favorite cube `favorite_value` and counts the number of cubes with the same value `same_value_count`.
5. It also counts the number of cubes with values greater than `favorite_value` `greater_count`.
6. Based on these counts, it determines the outcome:
	* If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means that all cubes with values greater than `favorite_value` will be removed, so the favorite cube will definitely be removed. It prints "YES".
	* If `greater_count` plus `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that all cubes with values greater than or equal to `favorite_value` will be removed, so the favorite cube will definitely not be removed. It prints "NO".
	* Otherwise, it means that the favorite cube may be either removed or left, depending on the order of the cubes with the same value. It prints "MAYBE".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including edge cases where `k` is equal to `n` or `f` is equal to 1. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
