Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial position. The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added and removed, and returns the maximum of these two values. This is because the number of cats that need to be added and removed are independent of each other, and the maximum of these two values represents the minimum number of operations required.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where the number of cats to add and remove are equal, and the cases where one of these numbers is zero. The program also handles the case where the input strings are empty, in which case the function returns 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
