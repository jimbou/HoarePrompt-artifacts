Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of days required to test the hypothesis by arranging the cats in the boxes according to the desired position. The program provided uses a function `func_1` to calculate this minimum number of days.

The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of boxes), `s1` (the initial position of the cats), and `s2` (the desired position of the cats). It calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`) by comparing the initial and desired positions.

The key insight here is that the minimum number of days required is the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is because we can perform one operation per day, and we need to either add or remove cats to reach the desired position. By taking the maximum of these two values, we ensure that we have enough days to perform all the necessary operations.

The program then uses this function to calculate the minimum number of days for each test case and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
