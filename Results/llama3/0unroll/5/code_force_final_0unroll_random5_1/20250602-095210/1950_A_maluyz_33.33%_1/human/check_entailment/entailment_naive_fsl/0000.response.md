Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a < b > c, but a is not equal to c. In this case, the program should print "PEAK", but it prints "NONE" instead.

For example, for the input "1 5 3", the program correctly prints "PEAK". However, for the input "1 5 2", the program incorrectly prints "NONE" instead of "PEAK".

The issue is with the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the digits form a peak. A peak is formed when a < b > c, regardless of the value of a.

To fix this, the condition should be changed to `elif a < b > c:`. This will correctly identify the peak cases.

Here is the corrected code:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```
