The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input (an integer between 1 and 1000) to the variable `t`. The stdin now contains a sequence of lines, each containing three digits (between 0 and 9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains a sequence of lines, each containing three digits (between 0 and 9).**
