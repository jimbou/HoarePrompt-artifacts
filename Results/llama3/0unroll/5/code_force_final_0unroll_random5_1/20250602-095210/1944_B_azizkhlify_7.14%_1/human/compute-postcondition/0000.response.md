Output State: **The output state is a series of lines, each containing a sequence of integers. The sequence is constructed by first printing pairs of identical integers from the first half of the input array, then printing a single integer from the first half of the input array, and finally printing pairs of identical integers from the second half of the input array. The number of pairs and single integers printed is determined by the values of n and k.**
