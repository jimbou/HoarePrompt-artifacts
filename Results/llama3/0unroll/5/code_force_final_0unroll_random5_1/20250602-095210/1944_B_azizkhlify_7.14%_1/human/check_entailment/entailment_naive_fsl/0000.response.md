Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

n = 4, k = 2
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]

The program will output:

1 1 2 2
1 1 2 2

However, the correct output should be:

1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input array contains all distinct elements. The program's logic is based on finding pairs of identical elements in the first half of the array and then finding pairs of identical elements in the second half of the array. However, this approach does not work when all elements are distinct.

The program should be modified to correctly handle this case. One possible solution is to sort the array and then find pairs of identical elements.
