The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then constructs a sequence of integers by printing pairs of identical integers from the first half of the input array, followed by a single integer from the first half, and finally pairs of identical integers from the second half. The number of pairs and single integers printed is determined by the values of n and k. The function outputs this sequence for each test case, with each sequence on a separate line.
