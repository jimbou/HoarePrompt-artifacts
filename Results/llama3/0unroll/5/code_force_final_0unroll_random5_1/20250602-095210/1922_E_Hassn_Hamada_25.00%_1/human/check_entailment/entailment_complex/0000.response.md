Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence list by appending new values and updating existing values. The function returns the total size of the generated sequence, which is the sum of the initial size and the result of a recursive function call. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0. The program also correctly handles the base case where the input number is 0, and the recursive case where the input number is greater than 0. The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
