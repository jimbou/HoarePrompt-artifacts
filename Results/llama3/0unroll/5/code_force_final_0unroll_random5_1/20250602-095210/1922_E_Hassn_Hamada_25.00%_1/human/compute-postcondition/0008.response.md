Output State: **`size` is 4, `number` is 10, `sequence` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3], `result` is returned by `func_1(1, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3])`**

The code calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The value of `number - (1 << size) + 1` is calculated as `10 - (1 << 4) + 1 = 10 - 16 + 1 = -5 + 1 = -4 + 1 = -3 + 1 = -2 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`. The value of `sequence` remains the same. The function `func_1` is called with these arguments and its return value is assigned to the variable `result`. The values of `size` and `number` remain unchanged.
