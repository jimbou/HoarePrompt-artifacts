You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer and sequence is a list of integers.
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is the current value of the variable 'number' and also the size of the generated sequence.
    #State: The size of the generated sequence is returned, number is a positive integer and not equal to 0, sequence is a list of integers.
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: size = 4, number = 10, sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: size = 4, number = 10, sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3]
    #
    #The loop iterates 4 times, appending the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 to the end of the sequence list. The values of size and number remain unchanged.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: `size` is 4, `number` is 10, `sequence` is [11, 12, 13, 14, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2, 3], `result` is 10.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 14, where 4 is the value of 'size' and 10 is the value of 'result'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0, which is the current value of the variable 'number' and also the size of the generated sequence.

Case_2: The program returns 14, where 4 is the value of 'size' and 10 is the value of 'result'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
