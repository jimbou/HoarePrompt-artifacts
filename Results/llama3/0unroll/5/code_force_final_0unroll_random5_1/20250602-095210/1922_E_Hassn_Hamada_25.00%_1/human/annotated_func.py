    return size + result
    #The program returns 14, where 4 is the value of 'size' and 10 is the value of 'result'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and modifies the input sequence list by appending new values and updating existing values. The function returns the total size of the generated sequence, which is the sum of the initial size and the result of a recursive function call. If the input number is 0, the function returns 0.
