Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is '12:00', the program outputs '12:00 PM', but it should output '12:00 PM' only when the input is '12:00' in 24-hour format, which is equivalent to '12:00 PM' in 12-hour format. However, when the input is '00:00', the program outputs '12:00 PM', which is incorrect because '00:00' in 24-hour format is equivalent to '12:00 AM' in 12-hour format.

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when the hour is '00' in 24-hour format, which should be converted to '12' in 12-hour format and marked as 'AM'.
