Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. It takes the hour and minute as input, determines whether it's AM or PM based on the hour, and then prints the time in 12-hour format.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The program has a lot of repeated code for each hour from 01 to 23. This can be simplified using conditional statements.

2. The program does not handle the case when the hour is 00 correctly. It should print 12:xx AM, but the program prints 12:xx PM.

3. The program does not handle the case when the hour is 12 correctly. It should print 12:xx PM for hours 12-23 and 12:xx AM for hours 00-11, but the program prints 12:xx AM for all cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h = int(h)
        if h == 0:
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h1 = str(h - 12)
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = str(h)
            time = 'AM'
        if len(h1) == 1:
            h1 = '0' + h1
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')

func()
```

Correctness: **False**
