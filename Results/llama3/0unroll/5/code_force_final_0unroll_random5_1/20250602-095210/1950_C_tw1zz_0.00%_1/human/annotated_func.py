    #State: The output state will contain t strings, each representing a time in 12-hour format, with 'AM' or 'PM' appended to the end. The hour will be in the range 01-12, and the minute will remain the same as in the input. For example, if the input is "14:30", the output will be "02:30 PM".

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a list of 24-hour time strings to 12-hour time format with AM/PM suffix.
