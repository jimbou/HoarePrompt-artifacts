Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to convert a list of 24-hour time strings to 12-hour time format with AM/PM suffix. The program correctly handles the conversion for all possible hour values from '00' to '23'. However, the program has a logical error in the handling of the hour '00'. In 12-hour format, '00' should be converted to '12' and the time should be 'AM', not 'PM'. 

Correctness: **False**
