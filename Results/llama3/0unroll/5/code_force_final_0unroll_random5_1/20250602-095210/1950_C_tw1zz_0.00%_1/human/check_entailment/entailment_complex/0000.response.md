Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert a list of 24-hour time strings to 12-hour time format with AM/PM suffix. The program iterates over each input time, checks the hour value, and determines the corresponding 12-hour format hour and AM/PM suffix.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the case where the hour is '00', the program sets the time to 'PM', which is incorrect. '00' in 24-hour format corresponds to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format, not 12:00 PM.

Correctness: **False**
