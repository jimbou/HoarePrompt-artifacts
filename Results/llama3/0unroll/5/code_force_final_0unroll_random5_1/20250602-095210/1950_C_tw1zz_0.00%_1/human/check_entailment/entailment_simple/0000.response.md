Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the cases where the hour is 00, 12, or between 13 and 23. It also correctly appends 'AM' or 'PM' to the output based on the hour.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the case where the hour is '00', the program sets the time to 'PM', which is incorrect. '00' in 24-hour format corresponds to 12:00 AM in 12-hour format, not 12:00 PM.

Correctness: **False**
