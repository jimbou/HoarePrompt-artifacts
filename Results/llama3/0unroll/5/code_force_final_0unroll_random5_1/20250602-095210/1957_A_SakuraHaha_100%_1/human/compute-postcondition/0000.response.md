The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the standard input, followed by `n` integers, which are stored in a list `a`. It then initializes two variables, `ans` and `cnt`, to 0 and an empty dictionary, respectively.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty**
