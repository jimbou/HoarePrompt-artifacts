Functionality: **This function reads a series of input pairs (n, k) from stdin, where n and k are integers, and for each pair, it calculates and prints the result of the expression (2 * (k - s) - 1) * m, where s and m are intermediate values determined by a while loop. The function processes t such pairs, where t is also read from stdin, and outputs a list of t integers, each corresponding to the result of the calculation for the respective input pair.**
