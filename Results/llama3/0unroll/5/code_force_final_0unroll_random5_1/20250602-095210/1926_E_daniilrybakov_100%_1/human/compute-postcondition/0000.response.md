The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains `t+1` inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), then `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). The first input is an integer `t`, which is assigned to `t`. Now, stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
