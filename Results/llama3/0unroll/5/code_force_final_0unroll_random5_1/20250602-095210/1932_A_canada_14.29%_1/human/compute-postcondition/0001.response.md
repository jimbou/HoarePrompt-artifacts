Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the number of '@' characters in each test case string, adjusted by the presence of '*' characters. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a string of n characters, then counts the '@' characters while considering the '*' characters. If two '*' characters appear in a row, the count is terminated. The function prints the adjusted count for each test case.**
