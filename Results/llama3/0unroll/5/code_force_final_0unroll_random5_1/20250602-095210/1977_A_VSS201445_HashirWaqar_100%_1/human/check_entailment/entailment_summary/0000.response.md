Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower. The program checks if the difference between n and m is even and if n is greater than or equal to m. This is because Nikita can only add or remove cubes in pairs to end up with an odd number of cubes (m). If the difference between n and m is even, it means Nikita can add or remove the required number of pairs of cubes to reach m. If n is greater than or equal to m, it means Nikita has enough moves to add or remove the required number of cubes.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
