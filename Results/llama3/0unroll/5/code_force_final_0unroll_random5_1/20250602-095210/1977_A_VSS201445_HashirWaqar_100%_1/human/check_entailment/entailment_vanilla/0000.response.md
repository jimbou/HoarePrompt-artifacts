Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking two conditions:

1. If n is greater than or equal to m, which ensures that there are enough moves to reach the desired height of m cubes.
2. If the difference between n and m is even, which is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the net change in the number of cubes must be even.

However, the program's logic is flawed. The condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 is not sufficient to guarantee that the tower can end up with exactly m cubes. This condition only checks if the difference between n and m is even, but it does not consider the actual sequence of moves.

For example, consider the case where n = 5 and m = 3. The program would output "YES" because n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0. However, it's not possible to end up with exactly 3 cubes after 5 moves, because the sequence of moves would be:

Move 1: Add 1 cube (total: 1)
Move 2: Add 1 cube (total: 2)
Move 3: Add 1 cube (total: 3)
Move 4: Remove 1 cube (total: 2)
Move 5: Add 1 cube (total: 3)

As we can see, after 5 moves, the tower would have 3 cubes, but the program's logic does not guarantee this outcome.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
