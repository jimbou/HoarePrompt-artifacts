Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program uses a simple and correct approach to solve this problem. It iterates over each test case, reads the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m), and then checks two conditions:

1.  If the number of moves (n) is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes (m). This is necessary because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves he makes.
2.  If the difference between the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m) is even. This is necessary because Nikita can only add or remove cubes in pairs (one cube added and one cube removed) to end up with an odd number of cubes.

If both conditions are met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
