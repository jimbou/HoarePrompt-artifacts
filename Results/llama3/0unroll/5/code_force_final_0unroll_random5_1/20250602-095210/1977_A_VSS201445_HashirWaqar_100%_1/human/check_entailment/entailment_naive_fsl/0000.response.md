Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` checks if the number of moves is sufficient to build the tower and if the remaining moves can be used to remove cubes from the top of the tower to reach the desired height. If this condition is met, the program prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, if n = 3 and m = 3, the program prints "YES" because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a row. If n = 2 and m = 4, the program prints "NO" because Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no blocks or a tower with 2 blocks. If n = 5 and m = 3, the program prints "YES" because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times and then remove 2 cubes from the top of the tower to reach the desired height.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
