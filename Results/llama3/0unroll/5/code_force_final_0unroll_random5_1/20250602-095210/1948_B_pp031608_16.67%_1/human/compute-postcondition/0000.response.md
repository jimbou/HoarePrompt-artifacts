Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `sorted_lst` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order**.

In this output state, the original list `lst` remains unchanged, and a new variable `sorted_lst` is created, which is a sorted version of `lst` in ascending order. The sorting is done using the built-in `sorted` function, which returns a new sorted list without modifying the original list.
