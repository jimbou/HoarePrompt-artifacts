Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine whether it is possible to make a given integer array sorted in non-descending order by applying a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves deleting an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted. It iterates through the list, and if it finds a pair of elements that are not in non-descending order, it checks if the previous element is greater than 10. If it is, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them into the list. This process is repeated until the list is sorted or it is determined that it cannot be sorted.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only checks if the previous element is greater than 10 and splits it if necessary. It does not consider the case where the current element is greater than 10 and needs to be split. This means that the program may not correctly determine whether the list can be sorted in all cases.

For example, consider the input list [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not split the third element (45) even though it is greater than 10. This means that the program will incorrectly determine that the list cannot be sorted.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
