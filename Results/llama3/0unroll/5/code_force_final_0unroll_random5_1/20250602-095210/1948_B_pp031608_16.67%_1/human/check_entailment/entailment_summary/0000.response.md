Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect because it only checks if the list is sorted after splitting the previous element when the current element is smaller than the previous one. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine if the list can be sorted by splitting elements. The program should check all possible splits of elements and verify if the list can be sorted.

Correctness: **False**
