Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the list and checking if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, and the previous element is greater than 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them into the list. This process is repeated until the list is sorted or it is determined that the list cannot be sorted.

However, there are a few issues with the program. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, but based on the comment, it seems to check if the list is sorted. The main issue is that the program only checks if the current element is less than the previous element, but it does not check if the current element is less than the elements that were inserted by splitting the previous element.

For example, if the list is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split the first element into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it will not check if the `3` is less than the `45`. Therefore, the program may incorrectly determine that the list can be sorted when it actually cannot.

Correctness: **False**
