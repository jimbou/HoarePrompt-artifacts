Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input [12, 3, 45, 67]. The program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but then it will not split the third element (45) into [4, 5] because it only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10. However, in this case, the previous element (3) is not greater than the current element (45), so the program will not split the third element.

To fix this issue, the program should check all elements, not just the previous one, to see if they can be split to make the array sorted. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to fix this issue:

```
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(len(list1)):
        if list1[p] > 10:
            a = list1[p]
            list1.pop(p)
            list1.insert(p, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p + 1, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
```

This modified program will split all elements that are greater than 10, which will ensure that the array is sorted.
