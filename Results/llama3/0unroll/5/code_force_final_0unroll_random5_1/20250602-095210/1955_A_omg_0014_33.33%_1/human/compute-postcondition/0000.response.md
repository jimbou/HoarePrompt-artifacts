Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input. Each line contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer from the first line of the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The remaining lines in the stdin, which are t lines, each contain three integers n, a, and b, where n is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and a and b are between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
