Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

The program then calculates the minimum cost by comparing the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) with the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), where d is half of the promotion price for two yogurts (c / 2). If the cost of buying at the regular price is less than the cost of buying at the promotion price, it prints the regular price; otherwise, it prints the promotion price rounded to the nearest integer.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price as a * d, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be the cost of buying the largest possible number of pairs of yogurts at the promotion price, plus the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

For example, if n = 3, a = 5, and b = 9, the program calculates the cost of buying 3 yogurts at the promotion price as 3 * (9 / 2) = 13.5, which is incorrect. The correct calculation is the cost of buying 1 pair of yogurts at the promotion price (9), plus the cost of buying 1 yogurt at the regular price (5), for a total cost of 14.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
