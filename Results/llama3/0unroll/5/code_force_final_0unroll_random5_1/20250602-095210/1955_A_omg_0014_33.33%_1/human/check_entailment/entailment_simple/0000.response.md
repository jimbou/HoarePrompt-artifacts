Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes the number of test cases (t) as input, followed by t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b.

The program then calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts by comparing the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * b) with the cost of buying n yogurts at the promotion price (a * d), where d is half of the promotion price (c). The program prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the minimum cost by comparing the product of a and b with the product of a and half of c, rounded to the nearest integer. This is incorrect because the program should compare the product of a and b with the product of a and the minimum of b and half of c.

For example, in the third test case of the example, the program calculates the minimum cost as the product of a and half of c (5 * 11/2 = 27.5), which is incorrect. The correct minimum cost is 15, which is the product of a and the minimum of b and half of c (5 * min(5, 11/2) = 5 * 5 = 25, but since n is 3, the correct answer is 5 * 3 = 15).

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
