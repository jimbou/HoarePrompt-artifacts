Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka" store, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and uses `input()` to read the number of test cases `n`.

3. Inside the loop, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

4. It calculates `d` as half of the promotion price `c`, which represents the price of one yogurt under the promotion.

5. The program then compares the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price (`a * b`) with the cost of buying `a` yogurts under the promotion (`a * d`).

6. If the regular price is less than the promotion price, it prints the regular price multiplied by `a`. Otherwise, it prints the promotion price multiplied by `a`, rounded to the nearest integer using `round()`.

7. However, there is a logical error in the program. The comparison `a * b < a * d` is incorrect because it does not consider the case where `a` is odd. When `a` is odd, buying `a-1` yogurts under the promotion and one yogurt at the regular price might be cheaper.

8. Furthermore, the program does not handle the case where `a` is even and `b` is less than `d`. In this case, buying `a/2` pairs of yogurts at the regular price might be cheaper than buying `a` yogurts under the promotion.

9. Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
