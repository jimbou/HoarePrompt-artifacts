Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the number of yogurts (a) is odd, the program does not consider the optimal solution of buying two yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price.

In the given program, the condition `if a * b < a * d` only checks if buying all yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying all yogurts at the promotion price. However, it does not consider the case where buying two yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price is the optimal solution.

For instance, if the input is `3 5 9`, the program will print `15` (3 * 5), but the correct answer is `14` (2 * 9/2 + 5).
