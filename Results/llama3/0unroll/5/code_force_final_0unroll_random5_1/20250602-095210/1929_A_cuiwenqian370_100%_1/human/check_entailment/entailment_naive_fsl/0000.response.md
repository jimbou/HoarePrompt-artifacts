Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.

The function `func_2` reads the input from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results. This is also in line with the problem description, which states that the program should read the input from the standard input and print the results to the standard output.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array has only two elements or when all elements are equal. It also correctly handles the general case, where the array has multiple elements and they are not all equal.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and it accurately implements the problem description.
