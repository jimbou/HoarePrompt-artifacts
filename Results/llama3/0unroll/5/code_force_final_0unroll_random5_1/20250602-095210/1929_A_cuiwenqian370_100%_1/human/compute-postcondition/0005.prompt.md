You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers of length n, where n is a positive integer and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: The loop iterates t times, and in each iteration, it reads an integer n from the data list at the current index, increments the index by 1, reads n integers from the data list starting from the current index, increments the index by n, applies the function func_1 to the read integers, and appends the result to the results list. After the loop finishes, the index is incremented by t + n*t, and the results list contains t elements, each being the result of applying func_1 to the corresponding set of n integers from the data list. The array list is updated to the last set of n integers read from the data list. The stdin remains empty.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed t iterations, and the results list contains t elements, each being the result of applying func_1 to the corresponding set of n integers from the data list. The index has been incremented by t + n*t, and the array list has been updated to the last set of n integers read from the data list. The stdin remains empty.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
