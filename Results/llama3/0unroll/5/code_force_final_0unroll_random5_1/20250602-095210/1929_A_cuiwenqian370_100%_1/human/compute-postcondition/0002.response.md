Output State: **The loop iterates t times, and in each iteration, it reads an integer n from the data list at the current index, increments the index by 1, reads n integers from the data list starting from the current index, increments the index by n, applies the function func_1 to the read integers, and appends the result to the results list. After the loop finishes, the index is incremented by t + n*t, and the results list contains t elements, each being the result of applying func_1 to the corresponding set of n integers from the data list. The array list is updated to the last set of n integers read from the data list. The stdin remains empty.**
