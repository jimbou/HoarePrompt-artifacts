Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

Function 1 sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is equivalent to calculating the beauty of the array. The function returns this sum, which represents the maximum beauty of the array.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it in batches of n integers, applies Function 1 to each batch, and prints the results. It iterates this process t times, where t and n are integers read from the input.

Since Function 1 correctly calculates the maximum beauty of an array, and Function 2 correctly applies Function 1 to each batch of input and prints the results, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
