Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, sorts it, and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is the key step in finding the maximum beauty of the array.

`func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it, and applies `func_1` to each set of integers. It then prints the results.

The program is correct because:

1. `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list, which is the maximum beauty of the array.
2. `func_2` correctly reads the input, parses it, and applies `func_1` to each set of integers.
3. The program prints the results correctly.

However, there is a minor issue with the program. In `func_1`, the `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between consecutive elements. This is not necessary, as the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list is always non-negative. Therefore, the `abs` function can be removed.

Correctness: **True**
