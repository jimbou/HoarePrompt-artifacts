Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes an array as input, sorts it, and calculates the beauty of the array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

3. `func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

4. The key to solving this problem is to realize that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by arranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the beauty of the array is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and the sum of the differences is maximized when the elements are in ascending order.

5. The given program correctly implements this approach by sorting the array in `func_1` and then calculating the beauty of the array.

6. The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

7. Therefore, the given program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
