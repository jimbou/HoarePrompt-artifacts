Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop iterates t times, and in each iteration, it reads an integer n from the data list at the current index, increments the index by 1, reads n integers from the data list starting from the current index, increments the index by n, applies the function func_1 to the read integers, and appends the result to the results list. After the loop finishes, the index is incremented by t + n*t, and the results list contains t elements, each being the result of applying func_1 to the corresponding set of n integers from the data list. The array list is updated to the last set of n integers read from the data list. The stdin remains empty.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
