Output State: The loop will execute 't' times. After each execution, the 'index' will be incremented by 'n + 1', where 'n' is the value at 'data[index]' in each iteration. The 'results' list will contain 't' elements, each of which is the result of calling 'func_1' on a slice of 'data' of length 'n'. The 'array' will be a list of 'n' integers in each iteration, where 'n' is the value at 'data[index]' in each iteration. The 'n' and 'result' variables will be updated in each iteration. The 'stdin' will remain empty.
