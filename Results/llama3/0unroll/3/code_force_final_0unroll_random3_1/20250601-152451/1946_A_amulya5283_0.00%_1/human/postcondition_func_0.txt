This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` test cases as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It calculates the number of operations required to make all elements in the second half of each test case greater than the median of the test case, and returns a list of `t` integers representing the number of operations performed on each test case.
