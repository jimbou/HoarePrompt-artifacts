Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of two elements: the first element is a positive integer `n`, the second element is a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed on the corresponding test case to make all elements in the heap greater than the median.
