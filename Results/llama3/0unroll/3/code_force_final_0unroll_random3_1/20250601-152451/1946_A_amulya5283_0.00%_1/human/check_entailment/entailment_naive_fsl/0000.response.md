Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program first sorts the array in ascending order. This is necessary because the median is defined as the middle value in the sorted array.

2. It then finds the median index, which is the index of the middle value in the sorted array. If the length of the array is even, the median is the average of the two middle values, but in this case, the problem statement allows us to increase the median by increasing the value at the median index.

3. The program then creates a heap from the values in the array that are greater than or equal to the median. This is done to efficiently find the smallest value that is greater than or equal to the median.

4. The program then enters a loop where it keeps increasing the smallest value in the heap by 1 until the smallest value in the heap is greater than the current median. The number of iterations of this loop is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

5. The program repeats this process for all test cases and prints the results.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including arrays of length 1, arrays with all elements equal, and arrays with an even number of elements. 

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
