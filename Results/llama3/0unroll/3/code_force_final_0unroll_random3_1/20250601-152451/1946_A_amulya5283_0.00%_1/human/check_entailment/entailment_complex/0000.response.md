Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The program takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers.

The program first sorts the array in non-decreasing order. Then, it calculates the median index and the current median value. It creates a heap from the second half of the array (including the median) and uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. The number of operations performed in this loop is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed on the corresponding test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array.

Correctness: **True**
