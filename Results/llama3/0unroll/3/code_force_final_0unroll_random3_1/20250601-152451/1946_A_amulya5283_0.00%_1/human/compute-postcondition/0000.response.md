Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of two elements: the first element is a positive integer `n`, the second element is a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `results` which is an empty list. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The `test_cases` list still contains test cases, each with a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers.
