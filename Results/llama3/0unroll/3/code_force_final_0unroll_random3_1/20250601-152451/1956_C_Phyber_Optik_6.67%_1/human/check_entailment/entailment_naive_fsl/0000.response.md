Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations.

The program calculates the maximum sum by iterating over the range from 1 to n and adding the maximum possible sum for each row. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the fact that the same permutation can be applied to multiple rows, which can lead to a higher maximum sum.

For example, consider the case where n = 3. The program calculates the maximum sum as 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, but the correct maximum sum is 7, which can be achieved by applying the permutation [1, 2, 3] to the first row and the permutation [2, 3, 1] to the second row.

Additionally, the program calculates the number of operations as n + r, where r is the number of rows that need to be filled with the maximum possible sum. However, this calculation is also incorrect because it does not consider the fact that some rows may need to be filled with a different permutation.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the maximum sum and the number of operations. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum sum for each row and then use a greedy algorithm to determine the number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
