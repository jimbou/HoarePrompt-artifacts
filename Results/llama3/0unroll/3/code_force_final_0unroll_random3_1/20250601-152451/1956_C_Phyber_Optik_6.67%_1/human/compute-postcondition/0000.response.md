The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, the first test case is consumed by this line of code. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), representing the size of the matrix `a`. The remaining test cases are still in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (one less than initially).**
