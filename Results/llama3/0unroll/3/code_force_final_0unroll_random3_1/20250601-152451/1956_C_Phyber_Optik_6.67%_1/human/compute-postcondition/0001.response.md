Output State: The loop will execute 't' number of times, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). In each iteration, it will read an integer 'n' from the standard input, calculate the sum of 'n' and 'r' (where 'r' is the largest integer such that 'n' times 'r' is less than or equal to the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers), and print the sum and 'n + r'. Then, it will print 'n + r' lines, each containing 'n' integers. The first 'n' lines will contain the numbers from 1 to 'n', and the remaining lines will contain the numbers from 1 to 'n' in a cyclic manner.
