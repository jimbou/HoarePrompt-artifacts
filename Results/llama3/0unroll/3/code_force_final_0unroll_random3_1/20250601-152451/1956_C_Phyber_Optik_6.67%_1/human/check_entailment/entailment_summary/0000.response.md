Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations required to achieve this sum. The program also correctly generates the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

The program works by first calculating the maximum sum that can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers from 1 to n. This is done by calculating the sum of the first n natural numbers and the value of n plus the largest integer r such that n*(n+1)//2 > i*n.

The program then prints the calculated sum and the value of n plus r, followed by a series of lines containing either 1 or 2, a number from 1 to n, and the numbers from 1 to n. These lines represent the sequence of operations required to achieve the maximum sum.

The program correctly handles the case where n is 1, in which case the maximum sum is 1 and the number of operations is 1. It also correctly handles the case where n is greater than 1, in which case the maximum sum is n*(n+1)//2 and the number of operations is n plus the largest integer r such that n*(n+1)//2 > i*n.

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
