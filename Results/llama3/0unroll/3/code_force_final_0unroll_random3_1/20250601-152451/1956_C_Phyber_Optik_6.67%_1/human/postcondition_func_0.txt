The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer n representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers and the value of n plus the largest integer r such that n*(n+1)//2 > i*n. It then prints the calculated sum and the value of n plus r, followed by a series of lines containing either 1 or 2, a number from 1 to n, and the numbers from 1 to n. The function repeats this process for each test case, with the number of test cases determined by the initial input.
