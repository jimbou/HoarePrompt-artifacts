You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop will either print 2 and terminate, or it will finish all iterations without printing anything. In the latter case, the state of the variables will remain unchanged, i.e., n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive) in the order they appeared in the input, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive) in the order they appeared in the input, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n is 2, the number 2 is printed. If n is not 2, either the number 2 is printed and the loop terminates, or the loop completes all iterations without printing anything, in which case the state of the variables remains unchanged and the number 3 is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: n is an integer and equals 2, v is a list of 3 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are 2 distinct integers between 1 and 2 (inclusive) in the order they appeared in the input, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the number 2 is being printed

Case_2: The loop will either print 2 and terminate, or it will finish all iterations without printing anything. In the latter case, the state of the variables will remain unchanged, i.e., n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive) in the order they appeared in the input, and stdin contains t-1 test cases, and 3 is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
