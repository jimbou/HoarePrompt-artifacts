Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them attend the party. The program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if the number of friends (n) is 2. If n is 2, it prints 2, as both friends need to be invited. If n is not 2, it checks for pairs of friends where each friend's best friend is also their best friend (i.e., v[v[v[i]]] == i). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, as only two invitations are needed. If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints 3, as at least three invitations are needed to ensure at least two friends attend.

The program's logic is correct, as it covers all possible scenarios:

1.  If n is 2, both friends must be invited, so 2 is printed.
2.  If n is not 2, it checks for pairs of friends where each friend's best friend is also their best friend. If such a pair is found, 2 is printed, as only two invitations are needed.
3.  If no such pair is found after checking all friends, 3 is printed, as at least three invitations are needed to ensure at least two friends attend.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends.

Correctness: **True**
