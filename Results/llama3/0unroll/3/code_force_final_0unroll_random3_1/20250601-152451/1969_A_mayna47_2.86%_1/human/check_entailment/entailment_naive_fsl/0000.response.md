Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program first checks if the number of friends is 2, in which case it prints 2 because both friends need to receive an invitation to come to the party.

If the number of friends is more than 2, the program checks for each friend if their best friend's best friend is the same as the original friend. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2 because sending invitations to these two friends will make both of them come to the party.

If it doesn't find such a pair, it prints 3 because in the worst case, Monocarp needs to send invitations to three friends to make at least two of them come to the party.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
