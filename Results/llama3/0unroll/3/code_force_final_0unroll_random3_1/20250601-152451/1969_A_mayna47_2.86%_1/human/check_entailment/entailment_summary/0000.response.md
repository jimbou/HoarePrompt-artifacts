Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at his party.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 2. In this case, Monocarp needs to send invitations to both friends, so the program prints 2.
2.  For `n` greater than 2, the program checks for the existence of a cycle of length 2 in the list `v`. A cycle of length 2 means that there are two friends `i` and `j` such that `v[i] = j` and `v[j] = i`. If such a cycle is found, the program prints 2, because Monocarp can send invitations to both friends in the cycle, and both will attend the party.
3.  If no cycle of length 2 is found, the program prints 3. This is because, in the absence of a cycle of length 2, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
