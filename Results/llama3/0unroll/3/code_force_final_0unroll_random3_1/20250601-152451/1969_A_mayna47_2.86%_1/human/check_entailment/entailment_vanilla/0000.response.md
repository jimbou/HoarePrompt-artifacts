Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends attend the party. The program takes into account the best friend relationships between the friends and the condition that both a friend and their best friend must receive an invitation for the friend to attend.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, the program reads the number of friends `n` and their best friend relationships `v`.

3. If `n` is 2, the program directly prints 2, as both friends need to receive an invitation to attend the party.

4. If `n` is greater than 2, the program checks for a specific condition: if there exists a friend `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition represents a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships, where friend `i`'s best friend's best friend is friend `i` themselves.

5. If such a cycle is found, the program prints 2, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 2 friends to have at least 2 friends attend the party.

6. If no such cycle is found, the program prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to have at least 2 friends attend the party.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the specific conditions and constraints of the problem. It correctly identifies the minimum number of invitations required to have at least 2 friends attend the party based on the best friend relationships.

Correctness: **True**
