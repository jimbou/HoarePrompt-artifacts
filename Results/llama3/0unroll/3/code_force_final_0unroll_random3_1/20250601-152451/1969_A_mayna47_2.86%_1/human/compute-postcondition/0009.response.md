Functionality: **This function reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers from standard input, then checks for a specific condition in the list. If n is 2, it prints 2. Otherwise, it checks if there exists an integer i such that the value at index v[v[i]] equals i. If such an integer is found, it prints 2. If no such integer is found after checking all elements, it prints 3. The function does not modify the input values or store any results; it only prints a single integer based on the input.**
