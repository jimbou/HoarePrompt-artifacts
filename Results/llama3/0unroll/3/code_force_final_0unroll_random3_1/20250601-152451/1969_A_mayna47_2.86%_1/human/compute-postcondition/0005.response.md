Output State: **The loop will either print 2 and terminate, or it will finish all iterations without printing anything. In the latter case, the state of the variables will remain unchanged, i.e., n is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive) in the order they appeared in the input, and stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
