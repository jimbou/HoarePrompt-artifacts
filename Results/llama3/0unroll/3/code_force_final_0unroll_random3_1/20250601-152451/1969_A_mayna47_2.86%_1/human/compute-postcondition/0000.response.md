Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive) in the order they appeared in the input, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) as specified in the initial state. The list `v` has been modified to have `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) that were input for the current test case, in the order they appeared in the input. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed.
