Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive) in the order they appeared in the input, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n is 2, the number 2 is printed. If n is not 2, either the number 2 is printed and the loop terminates, or the loop completes all iterations without printing anything, in which case the state of the variables remains unchanged and the number 3 is printed.***
