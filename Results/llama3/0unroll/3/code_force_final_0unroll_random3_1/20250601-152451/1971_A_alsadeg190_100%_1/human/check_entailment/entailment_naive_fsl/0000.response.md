Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers x and y. It then compares x and y, and prints the smaller one followed by the larger one. This logic is correct for all possible inputs, including the edge cases where x and y are equal, or where one of them is 0. The program also handles the case where x and y are both 0 correctly, printing 0 0. 

The program's logic is sound and it covers all possible cases, so it is correct.
