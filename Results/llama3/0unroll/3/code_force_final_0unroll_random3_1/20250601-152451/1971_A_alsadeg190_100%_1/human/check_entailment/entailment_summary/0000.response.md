Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where it needs to read a series of pairs of integers, find the minimum and maximum of each pair, and print them in ascending order. The program uses a simple if-else statement to compare the two numbers in each pair and print them in the correct order.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, indicating that it reads pairs of integers, sorts them in ascending order, and prints the sorted pairs.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly reads the input, compares the numbers in each pair, and prints the minimum and maximum values in the correct order.

Correctness: **True**
