Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The program first checks if the input integer n is 1, in which case it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to create a string with exactly 1 special character.

If n is not 1, the program constructs a string of uppercase letters based on whether n is even or odd. If n is even, it creates pairs of the same letter, starting from 'A' and incrementing the letter for each pair. If n is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then creates pairs of the same letter, starting from 'B' and incrementing the letter for each pair.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases for the input integer n. It also produces the correct output format, printing 'YES' followed by the constructed string, or 'NO' if no such string exists.

Correctness: **True**
