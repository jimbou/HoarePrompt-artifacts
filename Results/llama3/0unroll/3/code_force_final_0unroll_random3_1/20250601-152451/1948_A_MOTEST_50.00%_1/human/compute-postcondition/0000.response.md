Output State: **stdin contains t lines, each containing an integer n, s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive.**

The code snippet provided clears the console screen using `os.system('cls')`, which does not affect the state of any variables. Then, it assigns the string of all uppercase ASCII letters to the variable `s`. Finally, it reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since stdin initially contains two inputs (an integer `t` and then `t` lines, each containing an integer `n`), after reading the first integer, stdin will be left with `t` lines, each containing an integer `n`.
