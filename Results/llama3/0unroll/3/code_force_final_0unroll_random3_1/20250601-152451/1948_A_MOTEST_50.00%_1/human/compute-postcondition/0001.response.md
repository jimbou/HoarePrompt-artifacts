Output State: The output state is a series of strings, each representing a possible combination of uppercase ASCII letters, with each letter repeated twice, and the string 'NO' printed for each input of 1. The number of strings is equal to the number of inputs (t), and each string is of length n. The strings are generated in a specific pattern, with the first string starting with 'AA' and each subsequent string starting with the next two uppercase ASCII letters. If n is odd, the first string starts with 'AAA' and each subsequent string starts with the next two uppercase ASCII letters.
