Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases. It first checks if the input number `n` is 1, in which case it prints "NO" because there is no string with exactly one special character. For all other cases, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating each letter twice (except for the first letter in the case where `n` is odd, which is repeated three times). The program uses the ASCII uppercase letters to construct the string, ensuring that the string length is at most 200. The program correctly handles both even and odd values of `n`, and it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string in all cases where a solution exists.
