Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of lines, where each line is either 'NO' or 'YES' followed by a string of uppercase ASCII letters. The number of lines is equal to the initial value of t. For each line, if the corresponding input integer n is 1, the line is 'NO'. Otherwise, the line is 'YES' followed by a string of uppercase ASCII letters, where the length of the string is n, and the letters are arranged in a specific pattern based on whether n is even or odd. If n is even, the string consists of pairs of the same letter, starting from 'A' and incrementing the letter for each pair. If n is odd, the string starts with 'AAA' and then consists of pairs of the same letter, starting from 'B' and incrementing the letter for each pair.
