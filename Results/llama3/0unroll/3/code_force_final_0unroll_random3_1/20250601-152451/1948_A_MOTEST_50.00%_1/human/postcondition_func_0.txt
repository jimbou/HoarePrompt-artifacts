The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers. For each subsequent integer n, the function generates a string of uppercase ASCII letters based on whether n is even or odd. If n is 1, the function prints 'NO'. If n is even, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string of pairs of the same letter, starting from 'A' and incrementing the letter for each pair. If n is odd, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string starting with 'AAA' and then consisting of pairs of the same letter, starting from 'B' and incrementing the letter for each pair. The function repeats this process t times, printing the results for each integer.
