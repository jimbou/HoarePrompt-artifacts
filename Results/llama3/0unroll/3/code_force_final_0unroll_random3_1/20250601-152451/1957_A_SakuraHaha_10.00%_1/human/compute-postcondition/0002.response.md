Output State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). n is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers equal to the values of the first test case, ans is 0, cnt is a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in a and the values are their respective counts.
