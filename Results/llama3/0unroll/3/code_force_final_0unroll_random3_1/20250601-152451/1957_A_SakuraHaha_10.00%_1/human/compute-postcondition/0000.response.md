Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100). n is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers equal to the values of the first test case, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, and `a` is a list of integers equal to the values of the first test case. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and `cnt` is an empty dictionary. The stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
