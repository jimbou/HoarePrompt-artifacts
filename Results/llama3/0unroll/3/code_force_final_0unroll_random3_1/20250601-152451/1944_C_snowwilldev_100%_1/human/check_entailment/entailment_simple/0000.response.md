Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The program first counts the frequency of each integer in the list a using a dictionary cnt. Then it iterates over the integers from 0 to N (inclusive) and checks if the frequency of the current integer is 1. If it is, it increments a counter t. If t is greater than or equal to 2 or if the frequency of the current integer is 0, it returns the current integer as the final score.

The reasoning behind this is as follows: 

- If the frequency of an integer is 1, it means that Alice can pick that integer and Bob cannot pick it, so Alice can include it in her array c. 
- If the frequency of an integer is 0, it means that the integer is not present in the list a, so it will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in Alice's array c, which is the definition of MEX. 
- If t is greater than or equal to 2, it means that there are at least two integers with frequency 1, so Alice can pick one of them and Bob cannot pick the other one, so Alice can include one of them in her array c and the other one will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in Alice's array c, which is the definition of MEX.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize the score in the game.

Correctness: **True**
