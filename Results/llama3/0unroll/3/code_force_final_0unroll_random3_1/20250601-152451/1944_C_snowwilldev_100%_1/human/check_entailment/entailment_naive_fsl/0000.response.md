Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The key insight is that Alice wants to pick elements that will make the MEX of her array as large as possible, while Bob wants to pick elements that will make the MEX of Alice's array as small as possible.

The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. It then iterates over the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to N) and checks if the count of each element is 1. If it finds an element with a count of 1, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` becomes 2 or more, or if it finds an element with a count of 0, it returns the current MEX value.

This strategy works because if Alice picks an element with a count of 1, Bob will be forced to pick an element that will make the MEX of Alice's array smaller. If Alice picks an element with a count of 0, Bob will not be able to make the MEX of Alice's array smaller. By iterating over the possible MEX values, the program finds the largest MEX value that Alice can achieve.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the input array is empty or contains only one element. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
