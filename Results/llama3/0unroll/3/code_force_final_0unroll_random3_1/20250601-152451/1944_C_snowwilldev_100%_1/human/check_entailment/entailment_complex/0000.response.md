Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program iterates through the list of integers and counts the frequency of each integer. Then, it iterates through the range of possible integers and returns the smallest integer that appears either zero or more than one times in the list. This is the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score, as she wants to include all integers that appear more than once in the list, and for Bob to minimize it, as he wants to exclude all integers that appear only once.

The program correctly handles the case where there are no integers that appear more than once in the list, in which case it returns the value of n, which is the smallest integer that does not appear in the list.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are multiple integers that appear more than once in the list, in which case it returns the smallest such integer.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **True**
