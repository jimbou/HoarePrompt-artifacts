Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of N integers between 0 and N-1 inclusive, cnt is a dictionary with default value 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**.

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to N. The second line reads a list of N integers from stdin and assigns it to a. The third line initializes a dictionary cnt with default value 0. The code does not modify the values of N and a, but it initializes a new dictionary cnt. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the code reads two lines from stdin for each test case, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2.
