This function determines the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their maximum scores achieved by traversing a permutation and an array. It processes multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four lines: the first line contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S), the second line contains a permutation p, and the third line contains an array a. The function calculates the maximum score for both Bodya and Sasha by iterating through the permutation and array, and then compares their scores to determine the winner. The function prints the result of each game, which can be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.
