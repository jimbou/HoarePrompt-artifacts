Output State: **The loop iterates over multiple test cases, and for each test case, it determines the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on the maximum score they can achieve by traversing a permutation p and an array a. The output state is the result of the game for each test case, which can be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'. The values of YES, NO, MOD, and alpha remain unchanged. The stdin is empty after all test cases have been processed.**
