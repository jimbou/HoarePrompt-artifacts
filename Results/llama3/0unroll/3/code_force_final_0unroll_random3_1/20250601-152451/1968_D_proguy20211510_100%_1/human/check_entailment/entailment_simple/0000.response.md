Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game between Bodya and Sasha.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of four lines: the first line contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S), the second line contains n integers representing the permutation p, and the third line contains n integers representing the array a.
2.  The program correctly initializes the necessary variables, including the path for Bodya (pathb) and Sasha (paths), the visited array (vis), and the result variables (resb and ress).
3.  The program correctly implements the logic to find the path for Bodya and Sasha by traversing the permutation p and marking the visited nodes.
4.  The program correctly calculates the maximum score that Bodya and Sasha can achieve by traversing their respective paths and considering the number of turns (k).
5.  The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the maximum scores achieved by Bodya and Sasha.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its execution states match the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
