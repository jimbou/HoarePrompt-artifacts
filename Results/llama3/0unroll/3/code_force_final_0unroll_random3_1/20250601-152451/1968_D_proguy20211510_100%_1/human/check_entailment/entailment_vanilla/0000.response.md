Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha. The game involves a permutation and an array, and the players make moves simultaneously, with their scores increasing based on the array values.

The program first reads the input, which includes the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. It then reads the permutation and the array.

The program uses a while loop to construct the paths that Bodya and Sasha will take. It uses a visited array to keep track of the positions that have been visited to avoid infinite loops.

After constructing the paths, the program calculates the maximum score that Bodya and Sasha can achieve by iterating over the paths and calculating the score at each position. It uses the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` to calculate the score, where `preb` is the previous score, `pathb[i]` is the current position, and `k - i` is the remaining number of turns.

Finally, the program compares the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner.

Correctness: **True**
