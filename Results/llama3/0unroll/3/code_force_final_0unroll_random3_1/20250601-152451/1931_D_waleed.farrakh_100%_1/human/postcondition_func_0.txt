This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs in the corresponding test case that satisfy the conditions. The input list of test cases remains unchanged.
