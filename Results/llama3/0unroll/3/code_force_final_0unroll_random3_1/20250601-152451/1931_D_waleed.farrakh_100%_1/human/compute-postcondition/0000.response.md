Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is 1, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin.**

Explanation:

* The initial state provides information about the test_cases list, which contains tuples with four elements: n, x, y, and arr. The types and properties of these elements are specified.
* The code snippet reads input from sys.stdin using the input function, which is reassigned to read the entire input at once.
* The first line of input is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable t.
* The input is split into lines and stored in the data list.
* The test_cases list is initialized as an empty list.
* The idx variable is set to 1.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

* test_cases remains a list of tuples with the same structure and properties as before.
* t is an integer, which is the value of the first line of input.
* data is a list of strings, where each string represents a line of input.
* idx is 1, which is its initial value.
* input is now a function that reads from sys.stdin, which is a change from its original behavior.

Note that the code does not modify the test_cases list or its contents. It only initializes new variables and reassigns the input function.
