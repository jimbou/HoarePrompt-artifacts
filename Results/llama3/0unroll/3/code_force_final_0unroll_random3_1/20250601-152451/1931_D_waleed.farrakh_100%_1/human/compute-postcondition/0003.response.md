Output State: **The variable t is 0, the variable idx is 2*t + 1 = 1, the variable test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. The variable data is the same as the initial state. The variable results is returned by the function func_1 with test_cases as its argument.**

In this output state, the values of t and idx are calculated based on the initial state. The variable test_cases remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The variable data also remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The variable results is assigned the value returned by the function func_1 when it is called with test_cases as its argument.
