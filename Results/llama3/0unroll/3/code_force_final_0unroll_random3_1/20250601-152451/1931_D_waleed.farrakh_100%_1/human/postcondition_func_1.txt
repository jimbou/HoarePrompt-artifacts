The function accepts a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results. The function does not modify the input test cases or any external state. The purpose of the function is to perform some computation on each test case and produce a corresponding output. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the input test cases remain unchanged, and the function returns a list of results, one for each test case.
