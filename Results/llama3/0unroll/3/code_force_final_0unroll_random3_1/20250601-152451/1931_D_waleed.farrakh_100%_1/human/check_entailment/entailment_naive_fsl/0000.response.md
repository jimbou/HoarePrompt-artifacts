Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a. The function func_1 correctly calculates the frequency of each pair of remainders (rx, ry) and updates the count of beautiful pairs accordingly. The function func_2 reads the input data correctly and calls func_1 to calculate the results.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When the array a is empty, the function returns 0, which is correct.
* When the array a has only one element, the function returns 0, which is correct.
* When the array a has multiple elements, the function correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
* When x or y is 1, the function correctly handles the case where the remainder is 0.
* When x or y is greater than the maximum value in the array a, the function correctly handles the case where the remainder is greater than the maximum value.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, therefore the program is correct.
