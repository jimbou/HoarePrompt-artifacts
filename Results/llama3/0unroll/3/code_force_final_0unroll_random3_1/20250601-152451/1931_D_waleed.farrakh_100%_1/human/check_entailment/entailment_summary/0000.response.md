Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Function 1 (func_1) takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs in the corresponding test case that satisfy the conditions.

Function 2 (func_2) reads input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls Function 1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It correctly calculates the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counts the number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions. The program also correctly handles the input and output operations.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
