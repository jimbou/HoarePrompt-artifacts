Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs in the corresponding test case that satisfy the conditions.

func_2 reads input from the standard input, parses it into a list of test cases, and calls func_1 with the test cases as input. It then prints the results returned by func_1.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given conditions. It handles the input and output correctly and does not have any syntax errors. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
