Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the input string s. After all iterations, the loop will terminate, and the value of t will be 0.**

In natural language, the output state means that the loop will process all the test cases provided in the input, and for each test case, it will determine whether the binary string s satisfies certain conditions and print 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all test cases, the loop will finish, and the value of t will be reduced to 0. The initial state of t being a positive integer less than or equal to 50 will be changed to 0 after the loop execution.
