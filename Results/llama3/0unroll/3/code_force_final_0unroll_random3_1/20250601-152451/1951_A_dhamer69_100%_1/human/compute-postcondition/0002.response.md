Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n (less than or equal to 50) and a binary string s of the same length as n. It then checks the binary string s and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions: if n is 2, it prints 'YES' if s is '00', otherwise it prints 'NO'. If n is greater than 2, it prints 'NO' if the count of '1's in s is odd, or if the count of '1's is 2 and '11' appears exactly once in s. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function repeats this process for each test case and terminates when all test cases have been processed.**
