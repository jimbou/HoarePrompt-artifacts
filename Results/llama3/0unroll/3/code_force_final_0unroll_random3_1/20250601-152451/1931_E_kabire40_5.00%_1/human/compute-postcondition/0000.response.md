Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'Sasha' or 'Anna' printed to the console, depending on whether the reversed and sorted number is greater than 10 to the power of max_power for each test case. The input state remains unchanged, with stdin containing the same integer t followed by t test cases.**
