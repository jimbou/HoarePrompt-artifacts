Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. In the game, Anna can reverse the digits of any number, and Sasha can concatenate any two numbers. The program only considers reversing the digits of numbers that have the same length when reversed, and it does not consider the optimal moves for Sasha.

For example, consider the input:

3 5
9 56 1

The program will output "Anna", but the correct output is "Sasha". The optimal moves for Anna are to reverse the digits of 9 and 1, resulting in 9 and 1. Then, Sasha can concatenate 9 and 1 to get 91, and concatenate 56 with 91 to get 5691, which is greater than 10^5.

The program does not consider this case and does not correctly implement the game logic. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
