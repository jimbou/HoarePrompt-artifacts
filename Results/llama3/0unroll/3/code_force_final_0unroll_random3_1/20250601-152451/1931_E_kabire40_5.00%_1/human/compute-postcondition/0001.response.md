Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers (n and m) and the second line contains n integers. It then processes each test case by reversing and sorting the integers, and prints 'Sasha' if the resulting number is greater than 10 to the power of m, and 'Anna' otherwise. The function does not modify the input state.**
