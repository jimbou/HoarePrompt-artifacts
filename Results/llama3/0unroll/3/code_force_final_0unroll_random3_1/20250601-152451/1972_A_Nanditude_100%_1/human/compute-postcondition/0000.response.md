Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer n, then two lists a and b of length n. a and b are lists of non-decreasing positive integers less than or equal to 10^9.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been read and processed. The remaining test cases still contain three inputs each: an integer n, and two lists a and b of length n, where a and b are lists of non-decreasing positive integers less than or equal to 10^9.
