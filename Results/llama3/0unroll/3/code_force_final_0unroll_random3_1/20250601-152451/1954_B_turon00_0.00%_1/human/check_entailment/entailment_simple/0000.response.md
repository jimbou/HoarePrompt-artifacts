Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly identifies the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it not beautiful. If all elements in the array are the same, it correctly outputs -1. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. It updates the minimum count whenever it encounters a different element. Finally, it prints the minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
