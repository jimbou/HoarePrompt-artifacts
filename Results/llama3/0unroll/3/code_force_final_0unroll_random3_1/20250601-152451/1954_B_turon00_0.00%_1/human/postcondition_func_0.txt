This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in each list, or -1 if all elements in the list are the same. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.
