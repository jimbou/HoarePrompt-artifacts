Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.

The program then checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If the array contains different elements, the program initializes a variable `cnt` to 0 and a variable `ans` to the size of the array. It then iterates over the array, incrementing `cnt` whenever it encounters an element that is the same as the first element of the array, and resetting `cnt` to 0 whenever it encounters a different element. After each reset, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
