Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. It correctly reads the input and handles multiple test cases.
2. It checks if all elements in the array are the same, and if so, prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.
3. It initializes a variable `tmp` with the first element of the array and a set `aa` with all unique elements in the array.
4. It iterates through the array, counting the consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp`. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count `ans` if the current count `cnt` is smaller.
5. After iterating through the entire array, it updates `ans` one last time with the last count `cnt`.
6. Finally, it prints the minimum count `ans`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all edge cases, including arrays with all identical elements and arrays with varying elements.

Correctness: **True**
