Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin contains t-1 test cases because one test case has been read and processed. Each test case still contains two inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers.
