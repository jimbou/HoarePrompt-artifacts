Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, and the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` is less than `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `win_with_swap` is increased by 1 from the initial value of `wins`, which is the number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to the element at index `k-1` in list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
