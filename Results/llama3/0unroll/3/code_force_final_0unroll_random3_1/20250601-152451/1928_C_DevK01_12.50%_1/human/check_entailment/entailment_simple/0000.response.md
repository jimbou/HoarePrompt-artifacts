Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. The program correctly calculates the possible values of k by considering the divisors of (n + x - 2) // 2 and (n - x) // 2 that are greater than or equal to x - 1.

The function `func_1` correctly returns a list of divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1 and less than the square root of q. The main program then combines the results of `func_1` for (n + x - 2) // 2 and (n - x) // 2, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, and prints the length of the resulting set.

The program handles the edge case where n + x is odd by printing 0 immediately. It also handles the case where n is less than 3x - 2 by only considering the divisors of (n + x - 2) // 2.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
