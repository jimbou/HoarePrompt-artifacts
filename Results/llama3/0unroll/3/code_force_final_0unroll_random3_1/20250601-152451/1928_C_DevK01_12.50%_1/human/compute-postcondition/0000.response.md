Output State: **q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, M is an empty list, w is a float equal to the square root of q.**

In this output state, the values of q and x remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list M is initialized as an empty list, and the variable w is assigned the value of the square root of q, which is a float.
