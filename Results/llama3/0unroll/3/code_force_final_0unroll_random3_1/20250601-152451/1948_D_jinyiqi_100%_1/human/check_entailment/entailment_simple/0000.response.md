Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for tandem repeats of length 2*j. It uses a sliding window approach, maintaining a count of matching characters. If the count reaches j, it means a tandem repeat of length 2*j has been found, and the program prints the length and returns.

If no tandem repeat is found, the program prints 0.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string contains only question marks, in which case the maximum length of the tandem repeat is the length of the string.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input string does not contain any tandem repeats, in which case it prints 0.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
