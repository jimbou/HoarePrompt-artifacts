Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for tandem repeats of length `j` in each iteration.
2. For each `j`, it checks all substrings of length `j` in the string, comparing the first half with the second half.
3. If a tandem repeat is found, it prints the length of the repeat (which is `2*j`) and returns.
4. If no tandem repeat is found for any `j`, it prints 0.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

* If the input string contains only lowercase Latin letters, it correctly finds the longest tandem repeat.
* If the input string contains question marks, it correctly replaces them with lowercase Latin letters to form the longest tandem repeat.
* If the input string does not contain any tandem repeats, it correctly prints 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
