The first line assigns the first input from stdin to `s`. Since stdin contains t+1 inputs, the first input is an integer t. So `s` becomes a list of characters of the string representation of t. The second line assigns the length of `s` to `n`. Since `s` is a list of characters of the string representation of t, `n` becomes the number of digits in t.

Output State: **s is a list of characters of the string representation of t, n is the number of digits in t, stdin contains t inputs: t strings s.**
