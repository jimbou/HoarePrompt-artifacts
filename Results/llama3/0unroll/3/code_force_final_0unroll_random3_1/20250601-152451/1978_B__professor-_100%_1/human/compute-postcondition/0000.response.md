Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b, where each of these integers is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
