#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, and n is a non-negative integer.
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the calculated answer is less than or equal to the product of n and the maximum of a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum possible value of a weighted sum given the parameters k, a, b, and n, and returns a boolean indicating whether this calculated value is less than or equal to the product of n and the maximum of a and b.
