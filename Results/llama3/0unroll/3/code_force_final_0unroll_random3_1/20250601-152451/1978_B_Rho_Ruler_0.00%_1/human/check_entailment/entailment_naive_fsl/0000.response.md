Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented. The function is supposed to calculate the profit when `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price. However, the function is currently calculating the total revenue and comparing it with `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition.

A correct implementation of `func_1` would be to calculate the profit when `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price, and return `True` if this profit is greater than the profit when all `n` buns are sold at the usual price.

Here is a correct implementation of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    profit_modified = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1)) + (n - k) * a
    profit_usual = n * a
    return profit_modified > profit_usual
```

With this correct implementation, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
