The code snippet calculates the value of `ans` based on the initial values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. The first line initializes `ans` to 0. The second line adds the product of `k` and `b` to `ans`, effectively calculating the contribution of the first `k` items to the total. The third line adds the product of `(n - k)` and `a` to `ans`, effectively calculating the contribution of the remaining `(n - k)` items to the total.

Output State: **ans is equal to k * b + (n - k) * a, k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, and n is a non-negative integer.**
