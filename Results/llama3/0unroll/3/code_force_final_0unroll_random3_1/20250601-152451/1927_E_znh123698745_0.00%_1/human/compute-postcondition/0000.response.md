Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing a sequence of n integers. The sequence is constructed by alternating between the first and last elements of the array, moving towards the center. The first element of the sequence is always 1. For example, if n = 5 and k = 4, the output will be: 1 5 2 4 3.**
