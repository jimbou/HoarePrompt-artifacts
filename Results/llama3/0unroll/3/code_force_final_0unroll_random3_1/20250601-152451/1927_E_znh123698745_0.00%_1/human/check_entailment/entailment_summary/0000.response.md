Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It constructs a k-level permutation of length n by alternating between the first and last elements of the array, moving towards the center. This approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1, satisfying the condition for a k-level permutation.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases and the values of n and k for each test case, and printing the constructed permutation for each test case.

The use of the `a` list to keep track of the indices of the first and last elements of the array is a clever approach, allowing the program to efficiently construct the permutation.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n is equal to k, and when k is even.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
