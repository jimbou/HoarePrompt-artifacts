This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines each containing two integers n and k (2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5), where k is even. The function constructs a sequence of n integers by alternating between the first and last elements of an array, moving towards the center, and prints this sequence for each input line. The first element of the sequence is always 1. The function returns no value but prints t lines of output, each containing a sequence of n integers.
