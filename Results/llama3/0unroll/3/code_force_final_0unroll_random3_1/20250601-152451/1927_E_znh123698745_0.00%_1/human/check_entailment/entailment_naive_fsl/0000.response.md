Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to construct a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. The program works by creating an array of numbers from 1 to n and then constructing the permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description. The use of the `a` list to keep track of the indices of the smallest and largest remaining numbers is a clever approach.

I have analyzed the program and could not find any potential cases where it would not work as expected. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when n is equal to k, and it produces the correct output for the provided examples.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
