Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the product of the remaining elements after each command. The program uses the variable `ans` to store the product of all elements and then updates it by dividing by the removed element. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the product of the remaining elements should be calculated from scratch after each command.

For example, consider the input `n = 4, m = 6, arr = [3, 1, 4, 2], s = LRRL`. After the first command 'L', the array becomes `[1, 4, 2]`. The program calculates the product of the remaining elements as `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, which is incorrect because it does not recalculate the product from scratch. The correct product should be `1 * 4 * 2 = 8`, but the program calculates it as `24 // 3 = 8`, which is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should recalculate the product of the remaining elements from scratch after each command. This can be done by iterating over the remaining elements and calculating their product.

Here is the corrected code:
```
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n):
            prod = 1
            for i in range(l, r + 1):
                prod *= arr[i]
            res[k] = prod % m
            if s[k] == 'L':
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        print(*res)
```
This corrected code calculates the product of the remaining elements from scratch after each command, ensuring that the program correctly implements the problem description.
