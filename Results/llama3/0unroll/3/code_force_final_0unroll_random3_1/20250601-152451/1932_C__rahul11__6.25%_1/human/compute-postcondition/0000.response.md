Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4). The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `MOD` is now 1000000006. The input state remains the same, with an integer t (between 1 and 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case still consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (where n is between 1 and 2*10^5, and m is between 1 and 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (each between 1 and 10^4), and the third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.
