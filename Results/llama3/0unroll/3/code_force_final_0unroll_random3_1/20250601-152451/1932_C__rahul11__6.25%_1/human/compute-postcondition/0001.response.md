Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of the modular exponentiation of the product of the elements in the array `arr` with the modulus `m` and `MOD`, and the result is printed for each test case. The state of the other variables in the precondition remains unchanged.**
