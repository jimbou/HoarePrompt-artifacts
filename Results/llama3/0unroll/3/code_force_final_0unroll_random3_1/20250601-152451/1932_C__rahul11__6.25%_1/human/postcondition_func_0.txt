This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It takes no parameters and returns no value. For each test case, it reads two integers (n and m), an array of n integers, and a string of n characters. It calculates the product of the array elements, performs modular exponentiation with modulus m and MOD, and prints the results for each test case. The function does not modify the input variables.
