You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, and res is a list of tuples of integers.
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is True if and only if the subarray of `arr` starting at `start_index` and of length `i + 1` is a staircase (i.e., `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in range `i + 1`).
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The state of the variables remains the same: i is 0, arr is a list of integers with arr[start_index] equal to 1, start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended to it, and is_already_stairs is False.
    #State: *`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: i is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, res is a list of tuples of integers, is_already_stairs is False, arr[start_index + i] is equal to i, and the tuple (start_index, start_index + i) has been appended to res.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, a recursive call to `make_stairs` with argument `i - 1` has been made. Otherwise, `i` is decreased by 1, `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the tuple (`start_index`, `start_index + i`) has been appended to `res`, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The state of the variables remains the same: i is 0, arr is a list of integers with arr[start_index] equal to 1, start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended to it, and is_already_stairs is False.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
