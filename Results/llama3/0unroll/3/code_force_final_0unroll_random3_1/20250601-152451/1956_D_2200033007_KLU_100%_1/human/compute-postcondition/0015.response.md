Output State: **`i` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, and the tuple (`start_index`, `start_index + i`) has been appended to `res`, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` has been decreased by 1, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the new value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the function call has been added to the call stack.
