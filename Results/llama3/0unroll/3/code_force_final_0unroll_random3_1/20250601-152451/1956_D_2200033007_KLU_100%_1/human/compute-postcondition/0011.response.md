Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. The current value of `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, and a recursive call to `make_stairs` with argument `i - 1` has been made.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged. However, a recursive call to `make_stairs` with argument `i - 1` has been made, which may have its own effects on the program state. The condition `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i` is still valid.
