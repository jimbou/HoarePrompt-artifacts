Postcondition: ***`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, a recursive call to `make_stairs` with argument `i - 1` has been made. Otherwise, `i` is decreased by 1, `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the tuple (`start_index`, `start_index + i`) has been appended to `res`, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i - 1`.***
