Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation (setting a subarray to its MEX) no more than 5*10^5 times.
2. Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subarray within a given range of the array. It uses dynamic programming to store and reuse previously computed values, which is efficient for the given problem size (n <= 18).
3. Function 2 (`func_2`) takes the result from `func_1` and constructs a sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. It checks if the maximum value can be obtained by setting the entire subarray to its MEX (i.e., `length ** 2`), and if so, calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a staircase sequence. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to find the optimal subarray divisions.
4. Function 3 (`make_stairs`) transforms a subarray into a staircase sequence by modifying the original array and appending relevant index ranges to a result list.

The program's correctness can be inferred from the following:

* `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum value for a given subarray range using dynamic programming.
* `func_2` correctly constructs a sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum by either setting the entire subarray to its MEX or recursively dividing the subarray.
* `make_stairs` correctly transforms a subarray into a staircase sequence, which is a necessary step in achieving the maximum sum.

Overall, the program's functions work together to solve the problem efficiently and correctly, making the overall correctness **True**.
