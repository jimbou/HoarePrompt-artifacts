Output State: **i is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, res is a list of tuples of integers, is_already_stairs is False, arr[start_index + i] is not equal to i, and the tuple (start_index, start_index + i) has been appended to res.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `arr` also remains unchanged. The value of `start_index` is still an integer within the specified range. The list `res` has been modified by appending the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`. The boolean variable `is_already_stairs` remains `False`. Additionally, the condition that `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` still holds true.
