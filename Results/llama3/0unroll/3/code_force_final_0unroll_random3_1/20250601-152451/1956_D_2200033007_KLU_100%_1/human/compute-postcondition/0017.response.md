Functionality: **Transforms a subarray of a given list of integers into a staircase sequence, modifying the original list and appending relevant index ranges to a result list.**

The function takes four parameters: a non-negative integer `i`, a list of integers `arr`, an integer `start_index` within the bounds of `arr`, and a list of tuples `res`. It checks if the subarray starting at `start_index` with length `i + 1` is already a staircase sequence. If it is, the function returns without modifying anything. If not, it recursively transforms the subarray into a staircase sequence by modifying the original list and appending relevant index ranges to the result list. The function returns without a value, leaving the modified list and result list in their final state.
