Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation to maximize the sum of the elements of the array. The problem description allows for the operation to be performed no more than 5*10^5 times, but the program does not take this constraint into account. 

In the function `make_stairs`, the program appends the operation to the result list `res` without checking if the number of operations exceeds the limit. This can lead to incorrect results when the input array is large.

For example, if the input array is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the program will perform more than 5*10^5 operations, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
