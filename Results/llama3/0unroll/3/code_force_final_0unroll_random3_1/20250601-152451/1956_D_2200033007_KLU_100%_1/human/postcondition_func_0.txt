This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subarray within a given range of a list of non-negative integers and returns this maximum value. The function also updates a dictionary with the maximum value for the given range. If the maximum value for the given range is already present in the dictionary, the function returns the stored value. The function considers all possible subarrays within the given range and returns the maximum value that can be obtained.
