Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is True.**

In this output state, the value of `is_already_stairs` has been set to True, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `start_index` and the types of the variables are still valid.
