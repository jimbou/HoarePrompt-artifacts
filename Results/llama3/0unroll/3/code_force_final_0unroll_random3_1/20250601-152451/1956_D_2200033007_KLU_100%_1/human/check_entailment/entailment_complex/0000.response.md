Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subarray within a given range of a list of non-negative integers and returns this maximum value. The `func_2` function takes a list of non-negative integers and two non-negative integer indices, start_index and end_index, as input, and returns a list of tuples representing the operations needed to achieve the maximum value. The `make_stairs` function transforms a subarray of a given list of integers into a staircase sequence, modifying the original list and appending relevant index ranges to a result list.

The program correctly handles the base cases and the recursive cases, and it uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. The program also correctly updates the `res_dict` dictionary with the maximum value for each subarray, which allows it to avoid recalculating the maximum value for the same subarray multiple times.

The program's output is also correct. It prints the maximum sum of elements of the array `a` and the number of operations in the solution, followed by the operations themselves. The operations are represented as tuples of two integers, where the first integer is the start index of the subarray and the second integer is the end index of the subarray.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
