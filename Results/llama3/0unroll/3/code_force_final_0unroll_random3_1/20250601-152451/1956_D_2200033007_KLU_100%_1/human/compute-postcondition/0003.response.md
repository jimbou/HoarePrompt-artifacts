Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers. The subarray of `arr` starting at `start_index` and of length `i + 1` is a staircase (i.e., `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in range `i + 1`). The current value of `is_already_stairs` is True.***
