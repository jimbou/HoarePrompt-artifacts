#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and two non-negative integer indices, start_index and end_index, as input.

If the length is 1 and the value at the start_index is 0, it returns an empty list.

Otherwise, it iterates over the range, calculates a temporary result by calling func_1 twice and adding the value at the current index, and checks if it matches the maximum value. If a match is found, it returns the sum of the results of calling func_2 twice with different arguments. If no match is found, it checks if the value at the start_index plus the result of calling func_1 with start_index + 1 and end_index as arguments is equal to the maximum value, and if so, returns the result of calling func_2 with start_index + 1 and end_index as arguments. If not, it checks if the value at the end_index plus the result of calling func_1 with start_index and end_index - 1 as arguments is equal to the maximum value, and if so, returns the result of calling func_2 with start_index and end_index - 1 as arguments. If none of these conditions are met, it implicitly returns None.
