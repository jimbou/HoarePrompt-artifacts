Output State: **i is 0, arr is a list of integers with arr[start_index] equal to 1, start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended to it, and is_already_stairs is False**

The code block modifies the state of the program by appending a tuple to the `res` list and changing the value of an element in the `arr` list. The first line adds a tuple containing the `start_index` twice to the end of the `res` list. The second line changes the value of the element at the `start_index` position in the `arr` list to 1. The values of `i` and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged.
