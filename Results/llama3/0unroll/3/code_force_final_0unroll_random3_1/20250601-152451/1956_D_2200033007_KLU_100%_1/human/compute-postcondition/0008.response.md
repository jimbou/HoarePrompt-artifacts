Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The state of the variables remains the same: i is 0, arr is a list of integers with arr[start_index] equal to 1, start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of integers with the tuple (start_index, start_index) appended to it, and is_already_stairs is False.**
