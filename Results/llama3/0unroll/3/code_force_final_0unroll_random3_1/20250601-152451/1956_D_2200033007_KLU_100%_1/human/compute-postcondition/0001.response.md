Output State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of integers, and `is_already_stairs` is True if all elements in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index+i+1]` are equal to their respective indices `j` in the range `0 <= j <= i`, otherwise `is_already_stairs` is False.
