Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described in the problem statement. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes a positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 3 and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1' as input. It calculates the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in the string and then finds the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i`, considering the constraints that the cumulative sum of '0's up to `i` is at least half of the total '0's and the cumulative sum of '1's from `i` to the end is at least half of the total '1's. The function returns the index `i` that satisfies these conditions and is closest to `n/2`.

`func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of 0s and 1s of equal length, and processes each test case using the `func_1` function, leaving the standard input empty after all test cases have been processed.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the functions work together to achieve the desired output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
