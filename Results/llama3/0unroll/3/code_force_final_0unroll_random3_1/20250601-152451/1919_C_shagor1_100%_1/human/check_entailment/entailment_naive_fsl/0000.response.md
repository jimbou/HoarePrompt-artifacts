Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program splits the input array into two subsequences, `s` and `t`, and calculates the penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

The program uses two variables, `la` and `lb`, to keep track of the last elements in `s` and `t`, respectively. It iterates through the input array, and for each element, it checks if it can be added to `s` or `t` without increasing the penalty. If it can't be added to either, it increments the penalty and updates `la` and `lb`.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the input array has only one element or when all elements are the same. It also handles the case when the input array is already sorted, in which case the penalty is 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
