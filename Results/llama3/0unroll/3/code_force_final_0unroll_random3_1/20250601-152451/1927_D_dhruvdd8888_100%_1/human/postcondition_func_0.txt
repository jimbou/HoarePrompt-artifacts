This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer N, followed by a list of N integers, and then an integer Q, followed by Q pairs of integers. The function groups consecutive equal numbers in the list into ranges and stores them in a list of tuples. It then answers Q queries, where each query is a pair of integers (l, r). For each query, the function finds the range of consecutive equal numbers that overlaps with the query range [l, r]. If such a range exists, it prints the start and end indices of the overlapping range. If no overlapping range exists, it prints (-1, -1). The function processes all queries for each test case and prints the results.
