Output State: **The variable `LA` is assigned the value of the last index of the list `arr`, which is equal to the number of tuples in `arr` minus one. The values of the other variables are not affected.**

In this output state, the variable `LA` is now equal to the last index of the list `arr`, which represents the number of tuples in `arr` minus one. The values of the other variables, such as `arr`, `s`, and `num`, remain unchanged. The list `arr` still contains tuples representing the ranges of consecutive equal numbers in the list, and the variable `s` is still equal to the last index of the list. The variable `num` is still equal to the last number in the list.
