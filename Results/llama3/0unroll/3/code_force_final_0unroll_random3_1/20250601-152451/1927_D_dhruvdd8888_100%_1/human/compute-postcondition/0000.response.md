Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the list of N integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The code reads an integer N from stdin, representing the number of integers in the first list of the test case. It then reads N integers from stdin, storing them in the list nums. The variable s and e are initialized to 0, and the variable num is set to the first integer in the list nums. An empty list arr is created, and the list nums is modified by appending -1 to the end. After executing this code, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
