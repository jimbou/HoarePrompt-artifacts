You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, followed by a list of n integers, followed by an integer q, followed by q pairs of integers. All integers are greater than 0.
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates N+1 times, and in each iteration, it checks if the current number in the list is different from the previous number. If it is, it appends a tuple to the list 'arr' containing the index of the previous number plus one, the current index, and the previous number. It then updates the variable 's' to the current index. The variable 'num' is updated to the current number in the list in each iteration. After the loop finishes, the variable 's' will be equal to the last index of the list, and the variable 'num' will be equal to the last number in the list. The list 'arr' will contain tuples representing the ranges of consecutive equal numbers in the list.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `_` is assigned the value of the number of iterations of the loop, which is equal to the integer input by the user. The variable `l` is assigned the value of the last left boundary input by the user, and the variable `r` is assigned the value of the last right boundary input by the user. The variable `eli` is assigned the value of the insertion point of the last tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the list `arr` to maintain sorted order. The variables `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values of the first, second, and third elements of the tuple at the index `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`. The variable `LA` remains unchanged.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
