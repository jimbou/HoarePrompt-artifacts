Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly processes multiple test cases from standard input, groups consecutive equal numbers in the list into ranges, and answers queries by finding the range of consecutive equal numbers that overlaps with the query range. The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query range does not overlap with any range of consecutive equal numbers, and prints the correct output for each query.

Correctness: **True**
