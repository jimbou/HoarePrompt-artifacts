Correctness: **True**

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` within a given range `[l, r]` in an array `a` such that `a_i != a_j`. The program uses a clever approach by first creating a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple contains the start index `s`, end index `e`, and the value `num` of a contiguous subarray with the same value.

The program then uses binary search to find the appropriate tuple in `arr` for each query. If the start index `s` of the tuple is greater than the query's left boundary `l`, it means that the subarray starts after `l`, and the program checks if the subarray starts before `r`. If it does, the program returns the indices `s-1` and `s`. If the subarray starts after `r`, the program returns `-1 -1`.

If the end index `e` of the tuple is greater than or equal to the query's right boundary `r`, it means that the subarray ends after `r`, and the program returns `-1 -1`. If the end index `e` is less than `N` (the length of the array) or less than `l`, it means that the subarray ends before `l`, and the program returns the indices `s` and `e+1`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including edge cases where `l` or `r` is equal to `1` or `N`. The use of binary search ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large inputs.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
