Output State: The loop iterates N+1 times, and in each iteration, it checks if the current number in the list is different from the previous number. If it is, it appends a tuple to the list 'arr' containing the index of the previous number plus one, the current index, and the previous number. It then updates the variable 's' to the current index. The variable 'num' is updated to the current number in the list in each iteration. After the loop finishes, the variable 's' will be equal to the last index of the list, and the variable 'num' will be equal to the last number in the list. The list 'arr' will contain tuples representing the ranges of consecutive equal numbers in the list.
