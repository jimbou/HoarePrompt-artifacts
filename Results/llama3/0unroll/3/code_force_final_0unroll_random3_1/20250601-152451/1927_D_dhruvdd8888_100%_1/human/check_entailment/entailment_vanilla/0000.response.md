Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in an array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j`. The program uses a technique of grouping consecutive equal elements in the array and storing their start and end indices in a list `arr`. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the appropriate group that contains the query range `[l, r]`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
3.  It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, which will be used to store the start and end indices of each group of consecutive equal elements. It also initializes `num` to the first element of the array.
4.  The program then iterates over the array, and whenever it encounters a different element, it appends a tuple `(s + 1, i, num)` to the list `arr`, where `s + 1` is the start index of the group, `i` is the end index, and `num` is the value of the elements in the group. It then updates `s` to the current index `i`.
5.  After processing the entire array, the program reads the number of queries `q` and then iterates over each query.
6.  For each query, it reads the range `[l, r]` and uses binary search to find the appropriate group in the list `arr` that contains the query range. It does this by finding the insertion point of `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr` using the `bisect_left` function.
7.  Once it finds the appropriate group, it checks the following conditions:

    *   If the start index `s` of the group is greater than `l`, it means that the query range starts within a group. If the group starts at index 1 or the group's end index is greater than `r`, it prints `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the query range. Otherwise, it prints `s - 1` and `s` as the indices of different elements.
    *   If the end index `e` of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it means that the query range is fully contained within a group. In this case, it prints `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the query range.
    *   If the end index `e` of the group is less than `N` or less than `l`, it means that the query range starts after a group. In this case, it prints `s` and `e + 1` as the indices of different elements.
    *   If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the query range.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly solves the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
