    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is False if `not_c` is True, otherwise `A` remains True. `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `arr` remains unchanged, the first element of `set_` is 1, and `not_c` remains True.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Bob' because A is False since not_c is True.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of positive integers. It checks if the list contains consecutive integers starting from 1. If the list does not start with 1, the function returns 'Alice'. If the list starts with 1 but does not contain consecutive integers, the function returns 'Bob'. If the list starts with 1 and contains consecutive integers, the function also returns 'Bob'. The input list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
