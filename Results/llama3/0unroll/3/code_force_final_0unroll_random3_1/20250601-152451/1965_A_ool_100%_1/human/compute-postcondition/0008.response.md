The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to its opposite. Since `A` was initially `True`, its new value will be `False`.

Output State: **`A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `arr` remains unchanged, the first element of `set_` is 1, and the current value of `not_c` is True**
