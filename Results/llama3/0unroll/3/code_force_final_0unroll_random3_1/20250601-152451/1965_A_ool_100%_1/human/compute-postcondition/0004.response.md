Output State: **`A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list of unique positive integers from `arr`, `arr` remains unchanged, the first element of `set_` is 1, and `not_c` is True.**

In this output state, the values of `A`, `set_`, and `arr` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `not_c`, which is assigned the value `True`. The first element of `set_` is still 1, and `arr` remains unchanged.
