Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the initial number of stones in each pile.

The function `func_1` first checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If it does, Alice can win by choosing k equal to the size of the smallest pile, so the function returns 'Alice'.

If the smallest pile has only one stone, the function checks if the sizes of the piles form a contiguous sequence (i.e., the difference between consecutive sizes is 1). If they do, Alice can win by choosing k equal to the size of the smallest pile, so the function returns 'Alice'. If the sizes do not form a contiguous sequence, Bob can win by choosing k equal to the size of the smallest pile, so the function returns 'Bob'.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
