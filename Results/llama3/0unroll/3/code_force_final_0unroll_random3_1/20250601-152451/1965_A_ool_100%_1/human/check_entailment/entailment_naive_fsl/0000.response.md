Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the function `func_1(arr)`. The function checks if the smallest pile size is 1 and if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are all 1. If these conditions are met, it alternates the winner between Alice and Bob. However, this approach is incorrect.

A counterexample is when the input is `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. The program will output "Bob", but the correct output should be "Alice". The reason is that Alice can remove 2 stones from each pile on her first turn, leaving all piles empty and winning the game.

The correct approach would be to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all pile sizes. If the GCD is 1, then Bob wins. Otherwise, Alice wins. This is because if the GCD is greater than 1, Alice can remove that amount from each pile on her first turn, leaving all piles non-empty and forcing Bob to make a move. If the GCD is 1, then Alice cannot remove any stones without leaving at least one pile empty, allowing Bob to win.
