Output State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged**

The first line assigns the value False to A. The second line creates a set from the list arr, which removes any duplicate values, and converts it back to a list. The third line sorts this list in ascending order. The variable arr remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
