Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), adding 1 to each result, and then summing these two values.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the frequency of launching for the first installation (a), the second installation (b), and the time the firework is visible in the sky (m).
3. It calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation by dividing m by a and adding 1. This is because the first installation launches fireworks every a minutes, so the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time is the number of intervals of length a that fit within the time m, plus 1 for the initial firework.
4. Similarly, it calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the second installation by dividing m by b and adding 1.
5. It sums the results from steps 3 and 4 to get the total maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time.
6. It prints the result for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
