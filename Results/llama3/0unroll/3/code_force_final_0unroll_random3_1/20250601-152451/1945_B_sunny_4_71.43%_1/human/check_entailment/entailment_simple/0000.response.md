Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
*   For each test case, it reads the three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` as specified in the problem description.
*   The program then calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by calculating the number of multiples of `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `m`. This is done by using integer division (`int(m / a)`) and adding 1 to account for the inclusive range.
*   The program correctly prints the sum of these two values for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of integer division and adding 1 to account for the inclusive range is a common and correct approach to solving this type of problem.

Correctness: **True**
