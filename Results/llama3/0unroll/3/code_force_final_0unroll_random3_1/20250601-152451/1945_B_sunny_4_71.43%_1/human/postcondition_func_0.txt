The function reads a sequence of input sets from standard input, where each set contains three integers: a, b, and m. For each set, it calculates the sum of the number of multiples of a and b that are less than or equal to m, by performing integer division of m by a and b, rounding up to the nearest whole number, and adding the results together. The function then prints the calculated sum for each input set.
