Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data from standard input, which consists of a sequence of sets, each containing three integers: a, b, and m.
2. For each set of inputs, the program calculates the sum of the number of multiples of a and b that are less than or equal to m. This is done by performing integer division of m by a and b, rounding up to the nearest whole number using the `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` expressions, and adding the results together.
3. The program prints the calculated sum for each input set, which represents the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The use of integer division and rounding up ensures that the program accounts for the fact that fireworks are visible for m + 1 minutes after launch.

Therefore, the program produces the correct output for the given input data, and its correctness can be verified by checking the output against the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
