Output State: **The output state will be the sum of the number of multiples of a and b that are less than or equal to m, for each set of inputs. Specifically, for each set of inputs (a, b, m), the output will be the sum of the integer division of m by a (rounded up) and the integer division of m by b (rounded up). The output will be a sequence of these sums, one for each set of inputs.**
