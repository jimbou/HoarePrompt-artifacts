Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by summing the number of multiples of a and b that are less than or equal to m. This is achieved by performing integer division of m by a and b, rounding up to the nearest whole number, and adding the results together.

The program correctly handles the case where a firework is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, by adding 1 to the result of the integer division. This ensures that the program counts the firework that is launched at time 0, which would otherwise be missed.

The program also correctly handles the case where a firework is launched m minutes after another, by counting both fireworks as visible for one minute.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, calculating the correct sum for each input set and printing the result.

Correctness: **True**
