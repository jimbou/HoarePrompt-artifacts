Functionality: **Calculates and prints the maximum number of whole pizzas that can be made from given ingredients for multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers (a, b, c) as input and outputs the maximum number of whole pizzas or -1 if it's not possible to make whole pizzas. The function processes multiple test cases based on an initial input integer (n) that specifies the number of test cases.**
