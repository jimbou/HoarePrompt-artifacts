The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, where the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). This integer is assigned to `n`. The remaining lines in stdin contain three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9).**
