You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than 1.
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: factors is a dictionary containing the prime factors of n as keys and their respective powers as values, nn is 1, i is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of n
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of n as keys and their respective powers as values, where the power of `nn` is increased by 1 if `nn` is greater than 1, otherwise no change is made to `factors`, `nn` is 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of n.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the output state is the same as the initial state because the loop does not modify any variables. The `factors` dictionary remains unchanged, `nn` is still 1, `i` is still the smallest prime number greater than the square root of n, and `primes` is still a list of the prime factors of n.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
