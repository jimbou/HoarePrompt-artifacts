Output State: **primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, k is a non-negative integer equal to the length of primes, and 1 has been returned**.

In this output state, the values of the variables 'primes', 'factors', and 'k' remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only yields the value 1, which means it returns 1 but does not terminate the function, allowing it to continue executing from the same point later.
