Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of n as keys and their respective powers as values, where the power of `nn` is increased by 1 if `nn` is greater than 1, otherwise no change is made to `factors`, `nn` is 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of n.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the output state is the same as the initial state because the loop does not modify any variables. The `factors` dictionary remains unchanged, `nn` is still 1, `i` is still the smallest prime number greater than the square root of n, and `primes` is still a list of the prime factors of n.


#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primes is a list of prime numbers and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers. k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes).
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is as follows:
        #
        #* The variable "factor" has taken on all values in the "rest" list.
        #* The variable "prime_to_i" has been multiplied by the prime number "prime" for each iteration of the inner loop, resulting in a value of "prime" raised to the power of "factors[prime] + 1".
        #* The "yield" statement has produced a sequence of values, where each value is the product of the current "factor" and the current "prime_to_i".
        #* The variables "primes", "factors", "k", and "rest" remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
        #* The variable "prime" remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
        #
        #In summary, the loop has generated a sequence of values by multiplying each factor in the "rest" list by powers of the prime number "prime", and the output state reflects the final values of the variables after all iterations have completed.
    #State: *primes is a list of prime numbers and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers. If k is equal to the length of primes, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function generates a sequence of values by multiplying each factor in the "rest" list by powers of the prime number "prime", and the output state reflects the final values of the variables after all iterations have completed.
