Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints, but the program does not correctly calculate this number.

The program uses a prime factorization approach to generate all possible values of k, but it does not correctly filter out the values that do not meet the constraints. Specifically, it does not check if the generated value of k is greater than 1, which is a requirement stated in the problem description.

For example, if the input is n = 10 and x = 2, the program will generate k = 1, which does not meet the constraint that k > 1. Therefore, the program will incorrectly count k = 1 as a valid solution.

To fix this issue, the program should add a check to ensure that the generated value of k is greater than 1 before counting it as a valid solution.
