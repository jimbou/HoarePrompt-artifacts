#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) separated by spaces. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of pairs that can be formed using the first i cards and j pairs, considering the constraints that each card can be used at most twice and each pair must be formed with two different cards.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed using 0 cards and 0 pairs, considering the constraints that each card can be used at most twice and each pair must be formed with two different cards.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed using the given sequence of cards, considering the constraints that each card can be used at most twice and each pair must be formed with two different cards. The function takes no explicit parameters and returns an integer value representing the maximum number of pairs.
