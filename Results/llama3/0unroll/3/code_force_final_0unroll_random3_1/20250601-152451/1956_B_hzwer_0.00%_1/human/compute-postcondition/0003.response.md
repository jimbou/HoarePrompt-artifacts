Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed using the given sequence of cards, considering the constraints that each card can be used at most twice and each pair must be formed with two different cards. The function takes no explicit parameters and returns an integer value representing the maximum number of pairs.**
