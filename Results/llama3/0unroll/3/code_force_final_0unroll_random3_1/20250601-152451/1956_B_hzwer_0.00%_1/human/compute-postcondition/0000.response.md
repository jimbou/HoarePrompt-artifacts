Output State: **n is an integer, cards is a list of n integers, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) with dp[n-1][0] = 0 and dp[n-2][0] = 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**.

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer that was read from the first line of a test case in stdin. The `cards` list contains `n` integers that were read from the second line of the same test case in stdin. The `dp` list is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` that was initialized with all elements as 0, except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are set to 0. The stdin now contains one less test case than initially, as one test case has been read and processed.
