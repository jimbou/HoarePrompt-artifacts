Postcondition: **`a` is a list of positive integers and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of the list `a`. The length of the list `a` is more than 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. `winNext` is returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. The current value of `winNext` is either 2 or 1, and if `winNext` is 1, then the first element of `a` is not 1.**
