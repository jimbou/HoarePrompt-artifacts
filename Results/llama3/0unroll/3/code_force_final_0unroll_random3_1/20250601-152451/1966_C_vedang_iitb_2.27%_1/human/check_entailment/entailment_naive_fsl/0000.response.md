Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly calculate the XOR of the differences between the elements in the sorted array.

In the function `func_1`, the program calculates the differences between the elements in the sorted array, but it does not correctly calculate the XOR of these differences. The XOR operation is not performed correctly because the program does not take into account the fact that the XOR operation is associative and commutative.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, the program will calculate the differences as `[2, 2, 2]`, but it will not correctly calculate the XOR of these differences. The correct XOR of these differences is `2 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0`, but the program will not calculate this correctly.

As a result, the program will not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. For example, if the input array is `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, the program will incorrectly determine that Alice wins, when in fact Bob wins.

To fix this issue, the program should correctly calculate the XOR of the differences between the elements in the sorted array. This can be done by using the XOR operator (`^`) to calculate the XOR of the differences.

Here is an example of how the program can be corrected:

```
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    xor = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        xor ^= a_new[i] - a_new[i-1]
    return xor
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases.
