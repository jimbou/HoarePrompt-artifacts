This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements. The function returns a new sorted list of non-negative integers where each element at index i (i > 0) is the difference between the original value at index i and the value at index i-1 in the original sorted list of unique non-negative integers. The original input list remains unchanged.
