Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game played on n piles of stones. The game is played by two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing stones from the piles. The player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes a list of non-negative integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements. This function is used to preprocess the input list of pile sizes.

Function 2, `func_2`, determines the outcome of the game based on the preprocessed list of pile sizes and its length. It returns 1 if the game can be won, and 2 if it cannot.

The main program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile. It then calls `func_1` to preprocess the list of pile sizes and `func_2` to determine the outcome of the game. If `func_2` returns 1, the program prints "Alice", otherwise it prints "Bob".

The program's logic is correct. `func_1` correctly preprocesses the list of pile sizes, and `func_2` correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the preprocessed list. The main program correctly reads the input and calls the functions to determine the winner of the game.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
