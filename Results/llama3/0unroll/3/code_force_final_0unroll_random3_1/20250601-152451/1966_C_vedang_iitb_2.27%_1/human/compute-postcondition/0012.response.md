Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of positive integers and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of the list `a`. The length of the list `a` is more than 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. `winNext` is returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. `winNext` is not equal to 2 and if `winNext` is 1, then `a[0]` is equal to 1.***
