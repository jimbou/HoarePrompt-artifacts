Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is equal to the length of the list `a`. The length of the list `a` is more than 1 and `n` is not equal to 2. `winNext` is returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, but a new variable `winNext` is introduced, which is assigned the return value of the function `func_2` called with the arguments `a[1:]` (the list `a` without its first element) and `n - 1`. The length of the list `a` is still more than 1, and `n` is still not equal to 2.
