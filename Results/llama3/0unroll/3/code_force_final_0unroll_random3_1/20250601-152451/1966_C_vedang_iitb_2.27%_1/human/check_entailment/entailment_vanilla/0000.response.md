Reasoning:

The problem is a classic example of a game theory problem, specifically a Nim game. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` as input and returns a new list `a_new` where each element is the difference between the corresponding element in `a` and the previous element in `a_new`. This function is used to normalize the input list.

`func_2` takes a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` as input and returns the winner of the game (1 for Alice, 2 for Bob). The function uses a recursive approach to determine the winner.

The key insight to this problem is that the winner of the game is determined by the Nim-sum of the sizes of the piles. The Nim-sum is calculated by XORing the sizes of the piles. If the Nim-sum is 0, then the second player (Bob) wins. Otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

The provided program does not explicitly calculate the Nim-sum, but it achieves the same result through the recursive function `func_2`. The function works by recursively calling itself with the remaining piles and determining the winner based on the result.

However, there is a mistake in the program. In the `func_2` function, the base case for `n == 1` is incorrect. When there is only one pile, the winner is determined by the size of the pile, not by a fixed value of 1. The correct base case should be `if a[0] == 0: return 2` (Bob wins if the pile is empty) or `if a[0] != 0: return 1` (Alice wins if the pile is non-empty).

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input list `a` is empty. In this case, the function `func_2` will raise an error when trying to access `a[0]`.

Correctness: **False**
