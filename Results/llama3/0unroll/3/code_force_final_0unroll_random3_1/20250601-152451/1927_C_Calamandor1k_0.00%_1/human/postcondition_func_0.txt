This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each case. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The function's purpose is to determine whether two sequences of integers meet certain conditions based on their lengths and values. For each test case, it reads three integers (n, m, k) and two sequences of integers (a and b), then checks if the count of elements in each sequence that are less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to half of k. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty after execution.
