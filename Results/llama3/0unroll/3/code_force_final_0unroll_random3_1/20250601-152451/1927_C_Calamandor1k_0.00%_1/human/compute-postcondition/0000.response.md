Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. n, m, and k are positive integers, 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), and k is even. 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6.**

In natural language, the output state is: the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, and `m` integers `b_1`, `b_2`, ..., `b_m`. The constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, and `b_j` remain the same as in the initial state.
