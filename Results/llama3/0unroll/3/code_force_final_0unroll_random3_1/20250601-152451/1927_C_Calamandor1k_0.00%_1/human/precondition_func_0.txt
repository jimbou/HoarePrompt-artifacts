stdin contains an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m. n, m, and k are positive integers, 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), and k is even. 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6.
