Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it counts the numbers in arrays a and b that are less than or equal to k. The program only checks the first max(len_a, len_b) elements of the arrays, which may not be enough to cover all numbers from 1 to k.

For example, consider the input:

6 5 6
2 3 8 5 6 5
1 3 4 10 5

In this case, the program will only check the first 6 elements of both arrays, but it will miss the number 4 in array b, which is also less than or equal to k. As a result, the program will incorrectly output "NO" when the correct output should be "YES".

To fix this issue, the program should check all elements in both arrays, not just the first max(len_a, len_b) elements.
