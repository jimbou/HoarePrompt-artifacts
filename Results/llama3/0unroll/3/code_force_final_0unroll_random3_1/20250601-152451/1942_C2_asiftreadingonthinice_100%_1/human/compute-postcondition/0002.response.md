Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the minimum number of operations required to make an array a permutation of numbers from 1 to n for each test case. It accepts an integer t (number of test cases) followed by t test cases, each consisting of three integers (n, x, y) and x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a list of integers, each representing the minimum number of operations required for each test case, considering the constraints and conditions specified in the code.**
