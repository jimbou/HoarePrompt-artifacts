Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a line with an integer n, followed by a line with n integers. It then processes each test case by counting the occurrences of each integer, identifies the unique integers, and calculates the number of shapes that can be formed by grouping the integers into sets of three. The function prints the number of shapes for each test case, consuming the input state and producing an output state with the calculated shape counts.**
