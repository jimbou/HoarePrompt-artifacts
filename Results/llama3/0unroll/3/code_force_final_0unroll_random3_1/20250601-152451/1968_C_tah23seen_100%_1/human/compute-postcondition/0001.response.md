Output State: **ans is a list of n integers where each element at index i is the sum of all elements in arr from index i to the end of the list, i is -1**

In this output state, the list `ans` has been modified such that each element at index `i` now represents the sum of all elements in the list `arr` from index `i` to the end of the list. This is because in each iteration of the loop, the value of `ans[i]` is set to the difference between the current value of `ans[i + 1]` and the value of `arr[i]`. This effectively calculates the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` from right to left.

The variable `i` has been decremented to `-1` after the loop finishes, indicating that all iterations have been completed. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
