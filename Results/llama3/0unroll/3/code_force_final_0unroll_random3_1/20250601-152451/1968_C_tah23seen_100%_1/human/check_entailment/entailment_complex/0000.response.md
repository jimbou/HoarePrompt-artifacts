Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`, where `x_i` is the input array and `a_i` is the output array.

The function `func_1` calculates the cumulative sum of the input array `arr` from right to left and returns the result as a list of integers. This is done by initializing the output array `ans` with `n` elements, all set to `10^9`. Then, starting from the second last element of `arr`, it calculates the value of `ans[i]` as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]` and moves backwards to the first element.

The key insight here is that the cumulative sum of the input array from right to left gives us the values of `a_i` that satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`. This is because the cumulative sum at each index `i` represents the sum of all elements in `arr` from index `i` to the end, which is equivalent to `a_i`.

The program then prints the output array `ans` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` that satisfies the given condition. The use of cumulative sum from right to left is a clever approach to solve this problem, and the program correctly calculates and prints the output array for each test case.
