Reasoning:
The provided Python program is designed to solve a specific problem where it needs to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n given an array x_2, x_3, ..., x_n such that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n. The program uses a function func_1 to calculate the array a.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the function func_1 does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function calculates the cumulative sum of the array from right to left, but it does not ensure that the calculated values satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}.

Moreover, the function initializes the array ans with 10^9, which is not necessary and may lead to incorrect results. The correct approach would be to initialize the first element of ans with a value that satisfies the condition x_2 = a_2 mod a_1, and then calculate the subsequent elements based on this initial value.

Therefore, based on the provided execution summary and the problem description, it can be concluded that the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
