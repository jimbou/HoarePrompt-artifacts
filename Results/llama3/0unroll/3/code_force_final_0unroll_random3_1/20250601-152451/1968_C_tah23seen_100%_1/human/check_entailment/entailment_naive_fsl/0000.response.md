Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program outputs:

999999999 999999997 999999999 999999998

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Specifically, 2 ≠ 999999997 mod 999999999.

The issue with the program is that it assumes that the value of a_i can be calculated as a_{i+1} - x_i, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to find a value for a_i that satisfies the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, which may not always be possible.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
