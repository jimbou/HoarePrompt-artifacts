Output State: **arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and n = len(arr) + 1, ans is a list of n integers all equal to 10^9, i is n - 2**

The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to `10^9`. It then sets the variable `i` to `n - 2`. The initial state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged.
