Output State: **The output state will contain multiple lines, each representing the output for a test case. Each line will contain a string of lowercase English letters, where the frequency of each letter is determined by the input array. Specifically, the i-th letter in the string will be the (array[i] + 1)-th occurrence of the letter corresponding to the index array[i] in the alphabet (with 'a' corresponding to index 0, 'b' to index 1, and so on). The length of each string will be equal to the length of the input array.**
