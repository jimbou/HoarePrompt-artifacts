#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of pairs of numbers in the corresponding test case that have the same residue modulo x and y.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of pairs of numbers in the corresponding test case that have the same residue modulo x and y.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by counting the number of pairs of integers that have the same residue modulo x and y. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of such pairs for the corresponding test case.
