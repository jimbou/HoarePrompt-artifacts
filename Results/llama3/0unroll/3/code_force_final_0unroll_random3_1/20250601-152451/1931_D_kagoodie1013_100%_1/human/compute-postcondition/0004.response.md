Functionality: **This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case by counting the number of pairs of integers that have the same residue modulo x and y. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of such pairs for the corresponding test case.**
