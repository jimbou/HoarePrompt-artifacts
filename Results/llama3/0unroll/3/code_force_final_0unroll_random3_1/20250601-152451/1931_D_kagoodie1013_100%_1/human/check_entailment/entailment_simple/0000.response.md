Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary (residue_map) to store the residues of the numbers in the array modulo x and y. It then iterates through the array, for each number, it calculates its residues modulo x and y, and checks if the pair of residues is already present in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

The program correctly handles the case where x or y is 1, as the problem statement guarantees that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers, as it uses a dictionary to store the residues, which automatically handles duplicates.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, as it iterates through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), as it uses a dictionary to store the residues.

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
