Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (t), the size of the array (n), Polycarp's favorite integers (x and y), and the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

2. The program then defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of test cases as input. Each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), Polycarp's favorite integers (x and y), and the elements of the array (arr).

3. Within the `func_1` function, the program iterates over each test case. For each test case, it initializes a count variable to 0 and an empty dictionary `residue_map`.

4. The program then iterates over each number in the array. For each number, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` by taking the negative of the number modulo x and the number modulo y, respectively.

5. The program then checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map` dictionary. If it does, it increments the count by the value associated with the tuple in the dictionary. This is because the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` represents a pair of residues that can form a beautiful pair with the current number.

6. The program then updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count associated with the tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. This is because the current number can form a beautiful pair with other numbers that have the same residues modulo x and y.

7. After iterating over all numbers in the array, the program appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

8. Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array according to the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
