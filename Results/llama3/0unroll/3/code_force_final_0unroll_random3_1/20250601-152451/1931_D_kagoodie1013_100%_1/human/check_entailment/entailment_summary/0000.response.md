Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a, as defined in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the size of the array, Polycarp's favorite integers x and y, and the elements of the array.
2.  It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of test cases as input and returns a list of results, where each result is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.
3.  Inside the `func_1` function, it iterates over each test case and initializes a dictionary `residue_map` to store the count of residues modulo x and y for each number in the array.
4.  For each number in the array, it calculates the residues modulo x and y, and checks if the negation of the residue modulo x and the residue modulo y are already present in the `residue_map`. If they are, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
5.  It then updates the `residue_map` with the current number's residues modulo x and y.
6.  Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list and returns the list of results.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
