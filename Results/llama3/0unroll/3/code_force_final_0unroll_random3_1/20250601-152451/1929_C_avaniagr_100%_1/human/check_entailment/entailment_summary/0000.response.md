Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having at least 'n' coins based on the values of 'k', 'x', and 'a'. The program handles different cases based on the relationship between 'x' and 'k-1', and calculates the minimum required value of 'a' to guarantee the desired outcome. The program then compares the given value of 'a' with the calculated minimum required value and outputs 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
