Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins for any integer n, given the casino's rules and promotion. The program considers three cases based on the value of x (the maximum number of consecutive losses) and k (the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win).

1.  If x < k - 1, the program checks if the initial number of coins (a) is greater than or equal to x + 1. If true, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

2.  If x == k - 1, the program checks if the initial number of coins (a) is greater than or equal to x + 2. If true, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3.  If x > k - 1, the program calculates a value z based on the number of times Sasha can afford to lose (x - k + 3) and the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win (k). If the initial number of coins (a) is greater than or equal to z, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the expected output for the given problem description.
