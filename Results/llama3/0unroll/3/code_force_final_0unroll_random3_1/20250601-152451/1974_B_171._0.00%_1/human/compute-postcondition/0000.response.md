Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, mapping is an empty dictionary, decoded is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty data structures, a dictionary called `mapping` and a list called `decoded`. The state of the variable `encoded` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
