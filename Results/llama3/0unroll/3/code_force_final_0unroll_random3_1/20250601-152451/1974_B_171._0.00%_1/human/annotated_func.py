    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string of lowercase Latin letters where each letter is a decoded version of the corresponding character in the encoded string.

#Overall this is what the function does:Decodes a given string of lowercase Latin letters by creating a mapping of unique characters and returns the decoded string, where each character is replaced by its corresponding decoded version.
