Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem. The issue lies in the way the mapping is created. The program creates a mapping from the characters in the encoded string to the characters in the alphabet, but it does not take into account the symmetric property of the encoding.

In the encoding process, the first character of the string r is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on. However, in the decoding process, the program does not reverse this mapping. Instead, it simply maps each character in the encoded string to the first available character in the alphabet that has not been mapped yet.

For example, if the encoded string is "serofedsoc", the program will create a mapping where 's' is mapped to 'a', 'e' is mapped to 'b', 'r' is mapped to 'c', and so on. However, this mapping is not correct because it does not take into account the symmetric property of the encoding.

A correct implementation of the decoding algorithm would involve creating a mapping from the characters in the encoded string to the characters in the string r, where the mapping is symmetric. This can be achieved by first creating the string r by sorting the characters in the encoded string, and then creating a mapping from the characters in the encoded string to the characters in the string r, where the mapping is symmetric.

Here is an example of a correct implementation of the decoding algorithm:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
```

This implementation first creates the string r by sorting the characters in the encoded string, and then creates a mapping from the characters in the encoded string to the characters in the string r, where the mapping is symmetric. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.
