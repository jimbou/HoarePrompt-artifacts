Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The program attempts to decode the encoded string by creating a mapping of unique characters. However, it does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The program should first construct the auxiliary string r, which consists of all distinct letters of the string s in alphabetical order, and then replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character from the string r. The program does not correctly implement this step. Instead, it creates a mapping of unique characters and replaces each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded version, which is not the correct decoding algorithm.

Correctness: **False**
