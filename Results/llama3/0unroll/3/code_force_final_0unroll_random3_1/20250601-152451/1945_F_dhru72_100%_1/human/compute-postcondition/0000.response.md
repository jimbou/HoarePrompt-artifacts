Output State: **`T` is a type variable, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, and then a list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The second list contains positive integers. The third list is a permutation of integers from 1 to the first integer.**

In this output state, a type variable `T` has been defined, but it does not have any specific value. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with three inputs: a positive integer, a list of positive integers, and a list of integers that is a permutation of integers from 1 to the first integer.
