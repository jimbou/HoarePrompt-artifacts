Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to the console. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer from stdin representing the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads another integer representing the number of vertices in a graph. It performs a series of operations on the graph, including removing vertices and updating lists, and finally prints the final ordering of vertices to the console in a specific format. The function consumes all input from stdin and terminates after processing all test cases.**
