Output State: The loop will execute once, and the output will be a list of integers representing the vertices of the graph in a specific order. The order is determined by the operations performed in the loop, which involve removing vertices from the set `vx` and appending them to the list `p1` or `p2` based on certain conditions. The final output will be a list of integers separated by spaces, preceded by an exclamation mark.
