Output State: **`q` is a function that takes an integer `d` as input, prints '? %d' % d, and returns a list of integers from the input, stdin contains one input: an integer (2 <= integer <= 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph.**

In this output state, the function `q` is defined to take an integer `d` as input, print '? %d' % d, and return a list of integers from the input. The stdin still contains one input: an integer (2 <= integer <= 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph, as the input for the function `q`.
