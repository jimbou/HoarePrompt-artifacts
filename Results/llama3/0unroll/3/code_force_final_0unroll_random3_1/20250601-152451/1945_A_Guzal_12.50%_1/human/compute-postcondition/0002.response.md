Output State: The output will be n lines, each containing an integer k. The value of k is calculated based on the input values a, b, and c. If the conditions (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0 are met, the output will be -1. Otherwise, k will be the sum of a and the integer division of (b + c) by 3, plus 1 if (b + c) is not divisible by 3.
