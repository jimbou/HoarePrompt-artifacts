Output State: The output state will contain `n` lines of output, each containing a single integer `k`. The value of `k` is calculated based on the input values `a`, `b`, and `c` for each iteration of the loop. If the condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` is true, the output will be `-1`. Otherwise, `k` will be calculated as `a + (b + c) // 3` plus an additional `1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
