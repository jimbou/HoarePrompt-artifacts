The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). This integer is assigned to `n`. The remaining lines in the stdin contain three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9) each.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains n lines of input, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).**
