Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the elements in ascending order, and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program only finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array and subtracts the minimum from the maximum, which is not the correct approach.

For example, if the input array is [1, 3, 2], the program will output 2 (3 - 1), but the correct output should be 2 (2 - 1 + 3 - 2 = 2). 

The correct approach would be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
