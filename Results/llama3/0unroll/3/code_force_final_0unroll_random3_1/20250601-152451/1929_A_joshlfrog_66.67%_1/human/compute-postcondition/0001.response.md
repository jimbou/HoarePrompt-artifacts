Output State: The loop will execute t times, each time reading a list of integers from stdin, finding the maximum and minimum values in the list, and printing their difference. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The value of t will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The state of stdin will be advanced by the number of test cases read, but its contents will not be modified. The output will contain t lines, each with the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the corresponding input list.
