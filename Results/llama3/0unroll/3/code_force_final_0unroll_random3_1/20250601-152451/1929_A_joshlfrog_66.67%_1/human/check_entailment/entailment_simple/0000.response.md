Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program correctly solves the problem by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and printing their difference. This is because the maximum beauty can be achieved by placing the minimum value at the beginning of the array and the maximum value at the end, thus maximizing the difference between the first and last elements.

The program correctly reads the input, finds the maximum and minimum values, and prints their difference for each test case. The output matches the expected output in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
