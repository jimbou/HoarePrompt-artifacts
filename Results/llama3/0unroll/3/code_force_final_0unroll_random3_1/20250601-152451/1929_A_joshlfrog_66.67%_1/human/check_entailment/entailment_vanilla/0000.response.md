Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum and minimum elements in the array and then subtracting the minimum from the maximum. However, this approach is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, whereas the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements. By only considering the maximum and minimum elements, the program is not taking into account the differences between other consecutive elements.

For example, consider the array [1, 3, 2]. The program would find the maximum element as 3 and the minimum element as 1, and would output 3 - 1 = 2. However, the correct beauty of the array would be (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
