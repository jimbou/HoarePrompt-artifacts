Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. In each iteration, it will read a list of integers from stdin, find the maximum and minimum values in the list, and print their difference. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The output will be the differences between the maximum and minimum values for each test case, printed on separate lines.
