Reasoning:

The problem statement requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower. The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the difference between n and m is even, it means that Nikita can add or remove an even number of cubes to reach m cubes. Since each move involves adding or removing one cube, an even number of moves is required to reach an even number of cubes. If the difference is also non-negative, it means that Nikita has enough moves to reach m cubes.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0. If both conditions are true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Correctness: **True**
