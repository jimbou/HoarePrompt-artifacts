Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The given program checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative. This condition is necessary and sufficient to determine if it's possible to build the tower.

Here's why:

* If the difference between n and m is even, it means that the number of moves (n) is either equal to the number of cubes (m) or greater than m by an even number. In the former case, it's possible to build the tower by simply adding m cubes. In the latter case, it's possible to build the tower by adding m cubes and then removing (n-m)/2 cubes twice (since n-m is even).
* If the difference between n and m is not even, it means that the number of moves (n) is greater than m by an odd number. In this case, it's not possible to build the tower because removing cubes can only decrease the height of the tower by an even number (since each removal operation removes 1 cube).

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative. If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build the tower. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Correctness: **True**
