Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains one integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 99). Each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). The current values of `n` and `m` are such that the difference between them is even and non-negative, and 'Yes' is being printed**
