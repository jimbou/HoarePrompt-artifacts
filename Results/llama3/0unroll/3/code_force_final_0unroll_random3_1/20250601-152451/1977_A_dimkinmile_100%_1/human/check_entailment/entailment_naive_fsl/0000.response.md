Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for it to be possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves.

The program works by iterating over each test case and checking if the condition is met. If it is, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where n and m are equal, and the case where n is greater than m.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
