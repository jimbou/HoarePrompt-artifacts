Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program reads two integers n and m from standard input and prints 'Yes' if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative, otherwise it prints 'No'.

The program's logic is based on the fact that Nikita can either put 1 cube on top of the tower or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move. Therefore, the difference between n and m represents the number of cubes that need to be added or removed to reach the desired tower height.

The condition (n - m) % 2 == 0 checks if the difference between n and m is even, which means that the number of cubes to be added or removed is even. This is a necessary condition for Nikita to build the tower with exactly m cubes.

The condition n - m >= 0 checks if the difference between n and m is non-negative, which means that Nikita has enough moves to add or remove the required number of cubes.

The program's logic is correct, and it correctly solves the problem. However, there is a small issue with the program. The function func_1() is called before it is defined, which will cause a NameError in Python. The function definition should be moved above the for loop.

Correctness: **False**
