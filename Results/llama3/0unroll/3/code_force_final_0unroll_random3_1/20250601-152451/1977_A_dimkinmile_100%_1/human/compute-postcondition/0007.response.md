Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains one integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 99). Each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). If the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
