Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program first reads the number of test cases (kreker) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers n and m, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

The program then checks two conditions:

1. If the difference between n and m (n - m) is even and non-negative, it prints "Yes". This is because if the difference is even, it means that the number of moves can be divided into pairs of adding and removing cubes, resulting in the desired number of cubes in the tower.

2. If the difference between n and m is odd or negative, it prints "No". This is because if the difference is odd, it means that there will be an extra move that cannot be paired with another move, resulting in an incorrect number of cubes in the tower. Similarly, if the difference is negative, it means that the desired number of cubes is more than the number of moves, which is not possible.

Based on the problem description and the program's logic, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
