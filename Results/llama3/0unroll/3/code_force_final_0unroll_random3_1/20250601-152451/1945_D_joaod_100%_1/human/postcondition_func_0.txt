This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines of input. It calculates and prints the minimum cost to move from an initial position to a final position, considering two types of costs: the cost to change a position and the cost to pass through a position. The function iterates over each test case, updating variables accordingly, and consumes the standard input. After executing all iterations, the function prints the minimum cost for each test case and leaves the standard input empty.
