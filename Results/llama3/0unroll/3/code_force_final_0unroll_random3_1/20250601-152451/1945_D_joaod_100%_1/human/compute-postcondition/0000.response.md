Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines of input. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, where n and m are positive integers and m is less than or equal to n. The second and third lines contain n space-separated positive integers.**

In this output state, the variable `cases` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines of input. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers n and m, where n and m are positive integers and m is less than or equal to n. The second and third lines of each test case contain n space-separated positive integers.
