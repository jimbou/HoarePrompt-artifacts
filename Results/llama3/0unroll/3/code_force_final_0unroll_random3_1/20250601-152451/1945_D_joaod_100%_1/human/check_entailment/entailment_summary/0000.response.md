Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to a position among the first m people in line. The program iterates over the queue from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the total cost and the best (minimum) cost found so far. It updates the total cost and the best cost based on the costs to change a position (a_i) and to pass through a position (b_i). The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
