Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and finally q lines each containing two integers. The integers are all positive and n and q are greater than or equal to 2.

    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state is as follows: The value of _ is the number of test cases minus one, l and r are the last pair of integers read from the input, eli is the index where the pair (l, 0, 0) should be inserted in arr to maintain sorted order, s, e, and _ are the values of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and tc is 5 plus the number of test cases. The values of N, nums, s, e, num, arr, LA, and stdin remain unchanged. If ppp is 23, the list of N positive integers followed by -1 has been printed for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer N, a list of N positive integers, and an integer Q, followed by Q pairs of integers. The function groups consecutive occurrences of the same number in the list and stores the start and end indices of each group. It then reads Q pairs of integers and for each pair, it finds the group that contains the pair and prints the start and end indices of that group if it exists, or -1 -1 otherwise. If a special condition (ppp == 23) is met, it prints the list of N positive integers followed by -1 for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.
