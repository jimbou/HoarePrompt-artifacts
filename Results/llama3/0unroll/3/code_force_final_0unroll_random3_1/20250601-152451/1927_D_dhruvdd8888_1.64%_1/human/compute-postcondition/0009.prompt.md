You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and finally q lines each containing two integers. The integers are all positive and n and q are greater than or equal to 2.
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nums is a list of N positive integers followed by -1, s is N, e is 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three values: the first value is the index of the first occurrence of a number in nums plus one, the second value is the index of the last occurrence of the same number in nums, and the third value is the number itself, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been partially read.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [list of N positive integers, -1] (where N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2)
    #State: *N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nums is a list of N positive integers followed by -1, s is N, e is 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three values: the first value is the index of the first occurrence of a number in nums plus one, the second value is the index of the last occurrence of the same number in nums, and the third value is the number itself, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been partially read. If ppp is 23, the list of N positive integers followed by -1 is being printed.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state is as follows: The value of _ is the number of test cases minus one, l and r are the last pair of integers read from the input, eli is the index where the pair (l, 0, 0) should be inserted in arr to maintain sorted order, s, e, and _ are the values of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and tc is 5 plus the number of test cases. The values of N, nums, s, e, num, arr, LA, and stdin remain unchanged. If ppp is 23, the list of N positive integers followed by -1 has been printed for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nums is a list of N positive integers followed by -1, s is N, e is 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three values: the first value is the index of the first occurrence of a number in nums plus one, the second value is the index of the last occurrence of the same number in nums, and the third value is the number itself, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been partially read, and the current value of ppp is 23, and the list of N positive integers followed by -1 is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
