This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer N, a list of N positive integers, and an integer Q, followed by Q pairs of integers. The function groups consecutive occurrences of the same number in the list and stores the start and end indices of each group. It then reads Q pairs of integers and for each pair, it finds the group that contains the pair and prints the start and end indices of that group if it exists, or -1 -1 otherwise. If a special condition (ppp == 23) is met, it prints the list of N positive integers followed by -1 for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.
