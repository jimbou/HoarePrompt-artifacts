Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3

The program outputs:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 3
-1 -1
1 3
2 5

The program fails to find the correct pair of different elements for the query (1, 5). The correct pair is (2, 5) but the program outputs (1, 3) which is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it uses a binary search approach to find the pair of different elements, but it does not correctly handle the case when the pair is not found in the first half of the array. In this case, the program should continue searching in the second half of the array, but it does not do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
