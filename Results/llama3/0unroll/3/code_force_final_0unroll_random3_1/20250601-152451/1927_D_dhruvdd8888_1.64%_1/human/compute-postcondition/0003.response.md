Output State: **N is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nums is a list of N positive integers followed by -1, s is N, e is 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three values: the first value is the index of the first occurrence of a number in nums plus one, the second value is the index of the last occurrence of the same number in nums, and the third value is the number itself, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been partially read.**

In natural language, the output state is: N is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, nums is still a list of N positive integers followed by -1, s is still N, e is still 0, num is still -1, arr is still a list of tuples where each tuple contains three values: the first value is the index of the first occurrence of a number in nums plus one, the second value is the index of the last occurrence of the same number in nums, and the third value is the number itself. A new variable LA is introduced which is the second last index of arr. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one test case that has been partially read.
