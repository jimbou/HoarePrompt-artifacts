Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state is as follows: The value of _ is the number of test cases minus one, l and r are the last pair of integers read from the input, eli is the index where the pair (l, 0, 0) should be inserted in arr to maintain sorted order, s, e, and _ are the values of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr, and tc is 5 plus the number of test cases. The values of N, nums, s, e, num, arr, LA, and stdin remain unchanged. If ppp is 23, the list of N positive integers followed by -1 has been printed for each test case.**
