Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly groups consecutive occurrences of the same number in the list and stores the start and end indices of each group. It then uses binary search to find the group that contains the query pair and prints the start and end indices of that group if it exists, or -1 -1 otherwise. The special condition (ppp == 23) is used for debugging purposes and does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
