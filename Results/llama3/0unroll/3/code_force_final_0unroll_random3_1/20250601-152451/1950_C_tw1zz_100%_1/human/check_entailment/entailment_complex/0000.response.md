Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format with AM/PM indicator. The program handles all possible cases for hours from 00 to 23 and correctly determines whether the time is AM or PM. The program also correctly handles the case where the hour is 12, which is a special case in 12-hour time format.

The program uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the correct hour and AM/PM indicator for each input time. While this approach may seem cumbersome, it is correct and easy to understand.

The program also correctly prints the output in the required format, with the hour and minute separated by a colon, followed by a space, and then the AM/PM indicator.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
