Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input hour is greater than 23. According to the problem description, the input hour should be between 00 and 23. However, the program does not have any error handling for invalid input hours. If the input hour is greater than 23, the program will not work correctly.

For example, if the input is "24:00", the program will not work correctly because it does not have a condition to handle hours greater than 23.
