Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert a time in 24-hour format to 12-hour format. It takes the hour and minute as input, and then uses a series of if-elif statements to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format and whether it is AM or PM.

The program correctly handles the conversion for all possible hours in 24-hour format, from 00 to 23. It also correctly handles the cases where the hour is 12 (noon) and 00 (midnight), which are special cases in the 12-hour format.

The program uses the `map` function to split the input string into hour and minute components, and then uses string concatenation to build the output string in the correct format.

The program also uses a `for` loop to repeat the conversion process for multiple test cases, as specified in the problem description.

However, the program can be improved for readability and maintainability by using a more concise and efficient approach, such as using the modulo operator to determine the equivalent hour in 12-hour format.

Correctness: **True**
