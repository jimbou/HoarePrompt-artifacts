Functionality: **This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks each string for specific conditions, and outputs whether the string can be split into two substrings with the same or different characters. If the string can be split, it outputs the split substrings; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function processes multiple strings based on the initial input value 't', which specifies the number of strings to process.**
