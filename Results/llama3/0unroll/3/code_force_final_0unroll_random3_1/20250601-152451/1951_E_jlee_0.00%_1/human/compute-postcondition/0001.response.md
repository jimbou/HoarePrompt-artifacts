Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each followed by either a single string (if 'YES' and the string can be split into two substrings with the same characters) or two strings (if 'YES' and the string can be split into two substrings with different characters), or no additional strings (if 'NO'). The number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings will be equal to the initial value of t. The strings will be the result of checking each input string for the conditions specified in the loop.**
