#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a function
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns the wrapper function.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns a wrapper function, which is created and returned without any modifications or additional operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of values of any type and d is a dictionary where keys are tuples of values of any type and values are the results of the function func for the corresponding keys.
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: *args is a tuple of values of any type, d is a dictionary where keys are tuples of values of any type and values are the results of the function func for the corresponding keys. If args is not in d, then args is added to d with a value equal to func(*args). Otherwise, d remains unchanged.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the result of the function func for the corresponding key args, which is a tuple of values of any type, from the dictionary d. If args is not in d, then the result of func(*args) is returned, otherwise, the existing value associated with args in d is returned.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function caches and returns the result of another function `func` for a given set of arguments `args`. If the result is already cached in the dictionary `d`, it returns the cached value. Otherwise, it computes the result using `func`, stores it in `d`, and returns it. The function effectively memoizes the results of `func` for different input tuples `args`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined from the function signature as it does not contain any parameters.
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is a line of input from the standard input, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a line of input from the standard input and returns it as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_2() returns a string that represents an integer.
    return int(func_2())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_2()

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_2() to an integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are the result of splitting the string returned by `func_2()` into substrings separated by the delimiter string, and then converting each substring to an integer using the `int()` function.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a delimiter string as input and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by first obtaining a string from the `func_2()` function, splitting this string into substrings based on the provided delimiter, and then converting each substring into an integer. The resulting list of integers is then returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined from the given function as it only contains a return statement with a call to another function func_2() without any parameters or variables.
    return func_2()
    #The program returns the value returned by the function func_2()

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calls another function, func_2(), and returns its result without modifying any input variables or performing any additional actions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n non-decreasing integers, D is a sorted list of m unique integers, F is a list of k integers, and inf is a negative infinity value.

The second maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list A is stored in next_max_diff. The values of n, m, k, D, and F remain unchanged.

    #State: Output State: The value of ans is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of the differences between the values of D at index l and the values of left and right, for all iterations of the loop. The values of max_diff, index, next_max_diff, n, m, k, D, F, left, and right remain unchanged.
    print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
    #This is printed: The maximum value between the updated ans and next_max_diff

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a list A and updates this value based on the presence of certain values in a sorted list D, considering a list of integers F. It returns the maximum value between the updated maximum difference and the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined from the given function signature as it does not contain any parameters.
    testcases = func_3()
    for _ in range(testcases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: The output state is the same as the initial state, as the loop does not modify any variables. The variable `testcases` still holds the return value of `func_3()`, and the loop has executed `func_6()` `testcases` number of times, but since the function definition is not provided, the exact effect of `func_6()` is unknown.

#Overall this is what the function does:Executes a loop a number of times equal to the return value of `func_3()`, calling `func_6()` in each iteration, without modifying any variables or producing any output.
