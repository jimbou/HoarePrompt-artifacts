The code prints the maximum value between the updated `ans` and `next_max_diff`. 

`ans` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of the differences between the values of `D` at index `l` and the values of `left` and `right`, for all iterations of the loop. 

`next_max_diff` remains unchanged.

Output: **The maximum value between the updated ans and next_max_diff**
