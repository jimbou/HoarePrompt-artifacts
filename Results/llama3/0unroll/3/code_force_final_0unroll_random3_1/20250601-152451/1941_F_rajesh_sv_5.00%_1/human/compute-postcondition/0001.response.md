Output State: **The output state is the same as the initial state, as the loop does not modify any variables. The variable `testcases` still holds the return value of `func_3()`, and the loop has executed `func_6()` `testcases` number of times, but since the function definition is not provided, the exact effect of `func_6()` is unknown.**
