Output: **The value of ans is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of the differences between the values of D at index l and the values of left and right, for all iterations of the loop. The values of max_diff, index, next_max_diff, n, m, k, D, F, left, and right remain unchanged. The maximum of the current value of ans and the value of next_max_diff is being printed.**
