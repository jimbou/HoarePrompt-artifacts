Output State: **max_diff is unchanged, index is unchanged, next_max_diff is unchanged, n is unchanged, m is unchanged, k is unchanged, D is unchanged, F is unchanged, left is the value of A at index - 1, right is the value of A at index, ans is the value of max_diff.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of max_diff, index, next_max_diff, n, m, k, D, or F. It only assigns new values to the variables left, right, and ans. The value of left is set to the element at index - 1 in list A, and the value of right is set to the element at index in list A. The value of ans is set to the value of max_diff.
