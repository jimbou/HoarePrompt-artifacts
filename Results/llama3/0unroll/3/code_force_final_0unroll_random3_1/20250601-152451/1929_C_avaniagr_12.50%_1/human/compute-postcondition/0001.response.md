Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, one for each test case, indicating whether the given conditions are met or not. The value of 't' remains unchanged, and the values of 'k', 'x', and 'a' are updated for each test case. The final state will have the same 't' value, but the values of 'k', 'x', and 'a' will be the last set of values read from the input for the last test case.**
