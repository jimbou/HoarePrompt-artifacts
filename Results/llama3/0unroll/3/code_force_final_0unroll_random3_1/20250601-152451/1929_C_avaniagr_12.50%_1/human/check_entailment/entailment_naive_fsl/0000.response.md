Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins by placing bets in the casino. The program considers three cases based on the value of x (the maximum number of consecutive losses) and k (the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win).

1.  If x < k - 1, the program checks if the initial number of coins (a) is greater than or equal to x + 1. If true, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

2.  If x == k - 1, the program checks if the initial number of coins (a) is greater than or equal to x + 3. If true, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3.  If x > k - 1, the program calculates the minimum number of coins required to guarantee having at least n coins by simulating the betting process. It calculates the total number of coins lost in x + 1 consecutive losses and checks if the initial number of coins (a) is greater than or equal to this total. If true, it prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the expected output for the given problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
