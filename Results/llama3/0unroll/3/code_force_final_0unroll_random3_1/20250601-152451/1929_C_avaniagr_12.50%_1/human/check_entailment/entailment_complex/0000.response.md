Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins in a casino game with certain rules. The program reads multiple test cases from the standard input, each containing three integers k, x, and a, which represent the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins Sasha has, respectively.

The program then checks the conditions for each test case based on the value of x relative to k. If x is less than k - 1, it checks if the initial number of coins a is greater than or equal to x + 1. If x is equal to k - 1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x + 3. If x is greater than k - 1, it calculates the minimum number of coins required to guarantee winning and checks if a is greater than or equal to this minimum number.

The program prints 'YES' to the console if the conditions are met for a test case, indicating that Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins, and 'NO' otherwise.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
