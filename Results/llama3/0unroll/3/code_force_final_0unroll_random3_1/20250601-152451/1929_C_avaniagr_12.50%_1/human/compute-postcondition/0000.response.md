The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first input is an integer representing the number of test cases. After accepting this integer, the stdin still contains the remaining test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains three integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9).**
