Functionality: **Determines whether a given set of conditions are met for multiple test cases and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console for each case. The function accepts no parameters and returns no values, instead, it reads input from the standard input and prints output to the console. The conditions are based on the values of three integers k, x, and a, and the function performs different checks depending on the value of x relative to k. The final state of the program is the same as the initial state, with the only change being the output printed to the console.**
