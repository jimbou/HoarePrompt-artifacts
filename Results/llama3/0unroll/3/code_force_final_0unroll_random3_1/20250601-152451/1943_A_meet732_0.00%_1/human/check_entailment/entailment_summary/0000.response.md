Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob tries to minimize it. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the input list. If 0 does not occur, the score is 0. Otherwise, it starts from the smallest possible score (1 or 2, depending on the count of 0) and increments it until it finds a number that occurs less than twice. This is because Alice can always choose a number that occurs twice to maximize the score, and Bob can always choose a number that occurs twice to minimize the score. The program correctly handles the edge cases and prints the correct score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
