Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the score for Alice and minimize it for Bob. The key insight is that Alice should try to pick elements that will make the MEX of her array as large as possible, while Bob should try to pick elements that will make the MEX of Alice's array as small as possible.

The program uses a count array `cntl` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the input array `a`. It then iterates through the count array, starting from the smallest element (0). If the count of an element is less than 2, it means that Bob can pick that element and reduce the MEX of Alice's array. Therefore, the program subtracts 1 from the current MEX value `c`.

The program also handles the case where the input array does not contain the element 0, in which case the MEX is 0.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.
