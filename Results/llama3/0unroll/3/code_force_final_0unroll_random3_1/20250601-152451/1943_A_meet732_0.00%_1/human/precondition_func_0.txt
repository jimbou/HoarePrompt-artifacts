stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The list of integers is of length n and contains non-negative integers less than n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
