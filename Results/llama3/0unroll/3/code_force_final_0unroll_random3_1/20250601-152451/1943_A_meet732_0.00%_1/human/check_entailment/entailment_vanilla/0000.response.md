Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
3. It initializes a count array `cntl` of size `n+1` to keep track of the frequency of each element in `a`.
4. It iterates over the elements of `a` and increments the corresponding count in `cntl`.
5. If the count of 0 in `cntl` is 0, it prints 0 as the final score, since the MEX of an empty array is 0.
6. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0 in `cntl`. This is because Alice can pick at most two 0s to maximize the MEX.
7. It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the count of each element in `cntl` is less than 2. If it is, it decrements `c` by 1.
8. If `c` becomes 0 or the current element `j` is equal to `n`, it prints `j` as the final score and breaks out of the loop.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately simulates the game and calculates the final score based on the optimal strategy for both players. The use of the `cntl` array to keep track of element frequencies and the `c` variable to keep track of the maximum MEX are clever optimizations that reduce the time complexity of the program.

Correctness: **True**
