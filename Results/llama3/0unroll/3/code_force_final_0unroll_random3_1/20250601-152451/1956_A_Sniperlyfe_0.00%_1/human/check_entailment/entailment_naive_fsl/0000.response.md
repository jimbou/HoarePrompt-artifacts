Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the row until no more players can be removed. The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each query, and prints the results.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly handles the case where the number of players is less than the minimum position in the sequence `p`, in which case no players are removed. It also correctly handles the case where the number of players is greater than or equal to the minimum position in `p`, in which case players are removed until no more players can be removed.

The program also correctly handles the case where the sequence `p` is empty, in which case no players are removed. This case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, but the program handles it correctly nonetheless.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
