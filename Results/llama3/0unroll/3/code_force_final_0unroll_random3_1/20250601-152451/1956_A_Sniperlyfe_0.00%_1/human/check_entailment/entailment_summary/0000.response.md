Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of players declared as winners in a game based on a given sequence of integers `a` and the number of players `n`. The game involves kicking out players at positions specified by the sequence `a` until no more players can be kicked out.

Function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `p` as input and returns the remaining number of players after repeatedly subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`, until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. This function simulates the game process.

Function `func_2` reads the input, applies `func_1` to each query `n` with the given sequence `p`, and prints the results.

The provided execution summaries for both functions match the expected behavior based on the problem description. `func_1` correctly simulates the game process, and `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each query and prints the results.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
