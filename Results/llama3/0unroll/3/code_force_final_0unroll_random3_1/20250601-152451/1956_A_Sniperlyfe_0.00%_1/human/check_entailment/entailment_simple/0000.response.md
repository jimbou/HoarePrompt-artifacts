Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. The function `func_1` simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the game until no more players can be removed. The function `func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each query, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the game simulation and query processing. The use of the `min` function in `func_1` ensures that the game simulation stops when no more players can be removed. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` for each query, and prints the results.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the `func_2` function, the `print` statement is inside the loop that processes the queries. This means that the program will print the results after each query, rather than printing all the results at once. This might not be the desired behavior.

Despite this issue, the program is correct in the sense that it produces the correct results for each query. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**, but with a minor caveat regarding the output format.

Correctness: **True**
