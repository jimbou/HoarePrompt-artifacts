Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. The problem requires determining the number of players declared as winners in a game based on an increasing sequence of integers and the number of players initially joining the game.

Function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `p` as input and returns 0 after repeatedly subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n`, until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. This function correctly simulates the game by removing players based on the given sequence.

Function `func_2` is the main function that reads input, updates the list `p` with new values, and applies `func_1` to each element in the list `qs` with the updated list `p`. It prints the results after each iteration.

The program correctly implements the problem description and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
