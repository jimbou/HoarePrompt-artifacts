Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of players that would be declared as winners in a game based on a given sequence of integers `a` and the number of players `n_i` in each test case.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of players) and `p` (the sequence of integers). It simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the game until no more players can be removed. The number of remaining players is then returned.

`func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. `func_1` correctly simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the game until no more players can be removed.
2. `func_1` correctly returns the number of remaining players after the game is over.
3. `func_2` correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
4. `func_2` correctly prints the results for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In `func_2`, the program prints the results after each test case, but it should print the results after all test cases have been processed. This is because the problem statement requires the output to be in a specific format, with all results for a test case on the same line.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
