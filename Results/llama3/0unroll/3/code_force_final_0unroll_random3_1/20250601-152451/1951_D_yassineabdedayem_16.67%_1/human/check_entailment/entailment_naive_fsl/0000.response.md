Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is less than k. In this case, the program will print "NO" even if it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. For example, if n = 7 and k = 3, the program will print "NO" but it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels.

The program also does not work correctly when n is equal to k. In this case, the program will print "NO" but it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program also does not work correctly when k is 1. In this case, the program will print "NO" but it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly 1 jewel.

The program also does not work correctly when n is a multiple of k. In this case, the program will print "NO" but it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program also does not work correctly when n is a multiple of k and k is greater than 1. In this case, the program will print "NO" but it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.
