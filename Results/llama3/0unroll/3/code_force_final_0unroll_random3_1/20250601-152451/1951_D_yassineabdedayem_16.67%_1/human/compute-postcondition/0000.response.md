The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18)**
