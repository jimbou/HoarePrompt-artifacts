This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and k. It then attempts to find a sequence of numbers that can be subtracted from n such that the remaining value is 0 and the sum of the sequence is k. If such a sequence is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. If no such sequence is found, it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.
