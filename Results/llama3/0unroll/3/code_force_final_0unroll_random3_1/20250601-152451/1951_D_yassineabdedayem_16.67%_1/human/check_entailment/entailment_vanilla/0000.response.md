Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of coins Alice has (n) and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (k).
3. The program initializes variables to keep track of the number of stalls (rep), the number of jewels to be bought (number), and a list to store the prices of the stalls (tab).
4. The program enters a while loop that continues until one of the following conditions is met:
   - n becomes 0 (Alice runs out of coins).
   - k becomes 0 (Alice buys the desired number of jewels).
   - The number of stalls (rep) reaches 60.
   - The number of coins Alice has (n) is less than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy (k).
5. Inside the while loop, the program calculates the minimum and maximum possible prices for the current stall. The minimum price is the minimum of n divided by k and k, and the maximum price is the maximum of n divided by k and k.
6. If the maximum price is equal to k and the total cost of buying k jewels at the minimum price is less than or equal to k, the program sets the number of jewels to be bought (number) to the minimum price and subtracts the maximum price from k. Otherwise, it sets the number of jewels to be bought (number) to the maximum price and subtracts the minimum price from k.
7. The program appends the number of jewels to be bought (number) to the list of prices (tab) and subtracts the total cost of buying the jewels from the number of coins Alice has (n). It also increments the number of stalls (rep).
8. After the while loop, the program checks if k is 0. If it is, it means Alice has bought the desired number of jewels, and the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices of the stalls. If k is not 0, it means Alice has not bought the desired number of jewels, and the program prints "NO".

Correctness: **True**
