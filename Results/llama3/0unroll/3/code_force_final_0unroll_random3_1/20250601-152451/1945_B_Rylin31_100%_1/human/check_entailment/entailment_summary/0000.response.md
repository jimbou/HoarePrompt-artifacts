Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The key insight is that the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time is equal to the sum of the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation in the time interval m + 1, plus 2 (since both installations launch fireworks at time 0).

The program calculates this sum by dividing m by a and m by b, which gives the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation in the time interval m + 1. The results are then added together and 2 is added to account for the fireworks launched at time 0.

The program correctly handles the case where a or b is greater than m, since in this case the quotient of m divided by a or b will be 0, which is the correct result.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the input correctly and producing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
