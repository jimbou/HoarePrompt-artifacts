Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the line where the result is printed: `print(m // a + m // b + 2)`. The addition of 2 is incorrect because it assumes that both installations will always launch a firework at the same time, which is not necessarily true.

A counterexample is when `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `m = 1`. In this case, the program will print `4`, but the correct answer is `2` because only two fireworks can be seen in the sky at the same time.

The correct solution should be `print(m // a + m // b + 1)`, without the extra addition of 1. This is because the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation in the time interval `m`, plus 1 (because the first firework launched by each installation is visible for `m + 1` minutes).
