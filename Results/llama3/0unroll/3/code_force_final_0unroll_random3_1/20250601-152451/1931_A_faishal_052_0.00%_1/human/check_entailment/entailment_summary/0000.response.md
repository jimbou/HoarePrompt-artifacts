Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from the given integer. The program first determines the three letters by subtracting the maximum possible value (26) from the input number until it is less than or equal to 26. It then sorts the letters in ascending order and prints them as the lexicographically smallest word.

Correctness: **True**
