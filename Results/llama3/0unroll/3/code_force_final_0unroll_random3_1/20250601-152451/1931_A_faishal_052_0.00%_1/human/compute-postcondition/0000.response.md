Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains `cases` lines, each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78)**.

In this output state, the value of `cases` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains `cases` lines, each containing an integer n, where n is between 3 and 78. The other variables are not affected by the code.
