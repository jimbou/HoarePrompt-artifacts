Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs "aab", but the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded is actually "aba". 

The issue with the program is that it always appends 1 to the array when the remaining value is less than or equal to 26, which is not correct. It should try to find the largest possible value that can be appended to the array while keeping the remaining value non-negative. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = []
        for j in range(3):
            for k in range(26, 0, -1):
                if lex - k >= 0:
                    arr.append(k)
                    lex = lex - k
                    break
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

This corrected program works by trying to find the largest possible value that can be appended to the array while keeping the remaining value non-negative. It does this by iterating over the possible values in descending order and appending the first value that satisfies the condition.
