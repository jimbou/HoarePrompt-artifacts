Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the positive integer from the input, and the stdin is now empty since it has been read. The initial state's condition that stdin contains one input: a positive integer is no longer valid, as the input has been consumed.
