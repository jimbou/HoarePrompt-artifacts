Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program first prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for each test case. These coordinates are chosen to maximize the Manhattan distance between them, which is 1.

For n = 3, the program prints the coordinate (2, 3) in addition to the previous two coordinates. This is because the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (2, 3) is 3, and the Manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (2, 3) is 2, which are both distinct from the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2).

For n > 3, the program prints the coordinate (2, 4) in addition to the previous two coordinates. This is because the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (2, 4) is 3, and the Manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (2, 4) is 2, which are both distinct from the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2).

The program then prints the coordinates (x, x) for x ranging from 4 to n. This is because the Manhattan distance between (x, x) and any other coordinate is x, which is distinct from the Manhattan distances between the previously printed coordinates.

Therefore, the program correctly maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in the grid.

Correctness: **True**
