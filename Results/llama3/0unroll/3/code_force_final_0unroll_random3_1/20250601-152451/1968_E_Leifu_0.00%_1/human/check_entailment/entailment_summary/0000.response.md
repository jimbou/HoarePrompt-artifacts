Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints a specific pattern of lines based on the value of n. If n is 3, it prints '1 1', '1 2', and '2 3'. For any other value of n, it prints '1 1', '1 2', '2 4', and then a series of lines from '4 4' up to 'n n'.

The program's logic is based on the idea of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances by placing cells in a specific pattern. The pattern is designed to ensure that the Manhattan distances between any pair of cells are distinct and cover the maximum possible range.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, consuming all input and producing a structured output without returning any value.

Correctness: **True**
