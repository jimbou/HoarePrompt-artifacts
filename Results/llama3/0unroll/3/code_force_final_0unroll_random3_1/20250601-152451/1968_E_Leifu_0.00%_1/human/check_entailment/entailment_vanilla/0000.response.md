Reasoning:

The problem asks to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program attempts to solve this problem by printing out specific cell coordinates for each value of n.

For n = 2, the program prints out the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2), which is a valid solution.

For n = 3, the program prints out the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3), which is a valid solution.

However, for n >= 4, the program prints out the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and then (j, j) for j = 4 to n. This is not a valid solution because the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (2, 4) is 3, but the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (j, j) for j >= 4 is j - 1, which is not necessarily distinct from 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for n >= 4.

Correctness: **False**
