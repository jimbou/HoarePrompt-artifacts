Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes a positive integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads a positive integer n and prints a specific pattern of lines based on the value of n.

The program's logic is as follows:

- If n is 3, it prints '1 1', '1 2', and '2 3', which corresponds to the optimal arrangement for n = 3 as shown in the problem statement.
- For any other value of n, it prints '1 1', '1 2', '2 4', and then a series of lines from '4 4' up to 'n n'. This pattern is designed to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples in the problem statement. Therefore, based on the provided execution states and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
