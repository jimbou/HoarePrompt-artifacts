Functionality: **This function reads a positive integer `t` from standard input, then for each of `t` iterations, it reads another positive integer `n` and prints a specific pattern of lines based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 3, it prints '1 1', '1 2', and '2 3'. For any other value of `n`, it prints '1 1', '1 2', '2 4', and then a series of lines from '4 4' up to 'n n'. The function continues this process `t` times, consuming all input and producing a structured output without returning any value.**
