This function determines the winner of a game played on a rectangular board with two players, Alice and Bob, based on their initial positions and the board's dimensions. It takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of six integers representing the board's height and width, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. The function then analyzes each test case and outputs the result, which can be either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', indicating the winner or a draw, respectively. The function consumes the input from stdin and prints the results for each test case.
