Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column but on different rows, and the difference between their rows is greater than 1. In this case, the program should check if Alice can reach Bob's row in the same column, but it does not do so.

For example, if the input is `10 10 2 5 8 5`, the program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can reach Bob's row in the same column by moving down and then down-left.

The program only checks if the difference between Alice's and Bob's rows is even or odd, and if they are in the same column, but it does not consider the case when they are in the same column but on different rows with a difference greater than 1.
