Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by finding the index i that minimizes the absolute difference between n/2 and i, subject to the condition that the number of 0's on the left side of the string is at least half the total number of 0's and 1's on the left side, and the number of 1's on the right side of the string is at least half the total number of 0's and 1's on the right side.

The program first reads an integer n and a string a of length n from standard input, where a consists only of 0 and 1. It then calculates the cumulative counts of 0 and 1 in the string using a list S. The list S contains n+1 lists, each with two elements, the first element of each list is the count of '0's in the substring of a from the start to the current position, the second element of each list is the count of '1's in the substring of a from the start to the current position.

The program then iterates over the string a and for each index i, it checks if the number of 0's on the left side of the string is at least half the total number of 0's and 1's on the left side, and the number of 1's on the right side of the string is at least half the total number of 0's and 1's on the right side. If this condition is met, it updates the answer ans to be the index i that minimizes the absolute difference between n/2 and i.

Finally, the program prints the answer ans to standard output.

The function func_2 is a test function that reads the number of test cases from standard input and executes the function func_1 for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
