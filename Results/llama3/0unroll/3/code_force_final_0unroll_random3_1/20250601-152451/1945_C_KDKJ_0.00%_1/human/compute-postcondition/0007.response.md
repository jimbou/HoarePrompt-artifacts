Output: **The value of ans is the index i that minimizes the absolute difference between n/2 and i, subject to the condition that the number of 0's on the left side of the string is at least half the total number of 0's and 1's on the left side, and the number of 1's on the right side of the string is at least half the total number of 0's and 1's on the right side. The values of n, a, S, satisfy, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of ans is printed.**
