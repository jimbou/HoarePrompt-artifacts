This function reads an integer n and a string a of length n from standard input, where a consists only of 0 and 1. It then calculates the cumulative counts of 0 and 1 in the string and finds the index i that minimizes the absolute difference between n/2 and i, subject to the condition that the number of 0's on the left side of the string is at least half the total number of 0's and 1's on the left side, and the number of 1's on the right side of the string is at least half the total number of 0's and 1's on the right side. The function prints this index i to standard output.
