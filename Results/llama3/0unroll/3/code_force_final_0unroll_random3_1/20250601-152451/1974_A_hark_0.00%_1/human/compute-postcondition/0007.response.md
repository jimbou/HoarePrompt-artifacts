To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is an integer between 0 and 99.
   - `y` is an integer between 0 and 99.
   - Either `x` is 0, or `y` is 0, or both `x` and `y` are 0.
   - The current value of `x` is 0.
   - The current value of `y` is greater than 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```
   print(math.ceil(y / 2))
   ```

Given the initial state, we know that `y` is greater than 0. The `math.ceil(y / 2)` expression calculates the ceiling of the division of `y` by 2. This means it will divide `y` by 2 and round up to the nearest whole number.

Since `y` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, dividing it by 2 will result in a value between 0.5 and 49.5. The `math.ceil` function will then round this value up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to half of `y`.

Output: **the smallest integer greater than or equal to half of y**
