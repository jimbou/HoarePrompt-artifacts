Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. 

`func_1` is not used in the program, but it seems to be a helper function that returns the smaller of two non-negative integers.

`func_2` is the core function that calculates and prints the minimum number of screens needed based on the input integers `x` and `y`. It handles different cases where `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, and both `x` and `y` are 0.

`func_3` is the main function that reads an integer `t` from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. It then calls `func_2` `t` times to process each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of screens needed based on the problem description. It handles all possible cases and edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
