Functionality: **Calculates and prints a value based on the input integers x and y. If both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory, where bxsfory1 is the ceiling of x divided by 15 plus 1, and bxsfory is the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is 0 and y is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is greater than 0 and y is 0, it prints the ceiling of x divided by 15. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function consumes the input from stdin and leaves it empty.**
