Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed, where bxsfory1 is an integer between 0 and 7, bxsfory is an integer between 1 and 50, and the sum is an integer between 1 and 57. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of y divided by 2 is being printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is being printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is being printed.***
