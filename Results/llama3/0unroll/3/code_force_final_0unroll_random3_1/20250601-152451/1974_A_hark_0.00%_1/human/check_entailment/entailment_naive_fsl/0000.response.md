Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. 

For example, when x = 14 and y = 1, the program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The 2x2 icon can be placed in the first screen, and the 14 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining space of the first screen and the second screen is not needed.

The issue is with the calculation of bxsfory1. The program is adding 1 to the result of math.ceil(x / 15) even if x is exactly divisible by 15. This is incorrect because if x is exactly divisible by 15, it means that the 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining space of the screens used for the 2x2 icons, without needing an additional screen.
