Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to construct a valid permutation p that satisfies the given array a. The program iterates through the array a and calculates the MEX (minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array) at each step. It then uses this MEX value to calculate the corresponding value in the permutation p.

The program correctly handles the cases where the MEX value is greater than the current minimum value (minn) and updates the minimum value accordingly. It also correctly handles the cases where the MEX value is less than or equal to the current minimum value, in which case it sets the MEX value to the absolute difference between the current minimum value and the given array value.

The program also correctly prints the calculated permutation p for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
