#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: the first input is an integer (number of test cases) (1 <= number of test cases <= 10^4), and each of the remaining inputs is a test case. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (length of p and a) (1 <= length of p and a <= 2 * 10^5), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (elements of array a) (-length of p and a <= elements of array a <= length of p and a).
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: The loop will iterate n times. In each iteration, if the current element in the array is positive, the minimum value (minn) will be appended to the mex list, and minn will be incremented by 1. If minn equals maxx, minn will be set to maxx + 1. If the current element is not positive, the absolute difference between the current element and minn will be appended to the mex list. If this difference is greater than maxx, maxx will be updated to this difference. After the loop finishes, the mex list will contain the calculated values, and minn and maxx will hold their final values.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will iterate n times. In each iteration, if the current element in the array is positive, the minimum value (minn) will be appended to the mex list, and minn will be incremented by 1. If minn equals maxx, minn will be set to maxx + 1. If the current element is not positive, the absolute difference between the current element and minn will be appended to the mex list. If this difference is greater than maxx, maxx will be updated to this difference. After the loop finishes, the mex list will contain the calculated values, and minn and maxx will hold their final values.
    print()
    #This is printed: The final values of minn, maxx, and the mex list after the loop finishes iterating n times

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a length and a list of integers. It then calculates and prints a list of values based on the input integers, iterating through the list and updating minimum and maximum values as it goes. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the calculated list of values, followed by the final values of the minimum and maximum values.
