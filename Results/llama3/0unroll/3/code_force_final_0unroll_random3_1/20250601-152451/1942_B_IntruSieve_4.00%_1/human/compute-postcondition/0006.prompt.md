You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: the first input is an integer (number of test cases) (1 <= number of test cases <= 10^4), and each of the remaining inputs is a test case. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (length of p and a) (1 <= length of p and a <= 2 * 10^5), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (elements of array a) (-length of p and a <= elements of array a <= length of p and a).
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: The loop will iterate n times. In each iteration, if the current element in the array is positive, the minimum value (minn) will be appended to the mex list, and minn will be incremented by 1. If minn equals maxx, minn will be set to maxx + 1. If the current element is not positive, the absolute difference between the current element and minn will be appended to the mex list. If this difference is greater than maxx, maxx will be updated to this difference. After the loop finishes, the mex list will contain the calculated values, and minn and maxx will hold their final values.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will iterate n times. In each iteration, if the current element in the array is positive, the minimum value (minn) will be appended to the mex list, and minn will be incremented by 1. If minn equals maxx, minn will be set to maxx + 1. If the current element is not positive, the absolute difference between the current element and minn will be appended to the mex list. If this difference is greater than maxx, maxx will be updated to this difference. After the loop finishes, the mex list will contain the calculated values, and minn and maxx will hold their final values.
    print()
    #This is printed: The final values of minn, maxx, and the mex list after the loop finishes iterating n times

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
