Precondition: **stdin contains multiple inputs: the first input is an integer (number of test cases) (1 <= number of test cases <= 10^4), and each of the remaining inputs is a test case. Each test case consists of two inputs: the first input is an integer (length of p and a) (1 <= length of p and a <= 2 * 10^5), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (elements of array a) (-length of p and a <= elements of array a <= length of p and a).**
