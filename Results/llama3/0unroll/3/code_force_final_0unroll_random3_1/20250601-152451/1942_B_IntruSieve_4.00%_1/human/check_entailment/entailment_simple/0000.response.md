Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` representing the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of `a`.

2. The program initializes two variables, `minn` and `maxx`, to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation `p` that have been constructed so far.

3. The program then iterates over the elements of `a`. For each element `a[i]`, it checks if `a[i]` is positive. If it is, the program appends the current value of `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn` by 1. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`. This ensures that the permutation `p` constructed so far is valid, i.e., it contains all integers from 0 to `minn - 1` exactly once.

4. If `a[i]` is not positive, the program appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `minn` to the `mex` list. If this difference is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx` to this difference. This ensures that the permutation `p` constructed so far is valid, i.e., it contains all integers from 0 to `maxx` exactly once.

5. After iterating over all elements of `a`, the program prints the elements of the `mex` list, which represents a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

6. The program repeats this process for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
