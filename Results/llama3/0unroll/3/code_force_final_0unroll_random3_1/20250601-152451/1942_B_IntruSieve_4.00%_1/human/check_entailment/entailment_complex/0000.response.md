Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a`. The program iterates through the array `a` and calculates the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p` up to that point, denoted as `mex`. The program then uses this `mex` value to construct the permutation `p`.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem's description accurately. The use of the `minn` and `maxx` variables to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation `p` is also correct.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the line where it calculates the `mex` value when the current element in the array is not positive, the program uses the absolute difference between the current element and `minn`. This is incorrect because the `mex` value should be the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p`, not the absolute difference between the current element and `minn`.

To fix this issue, the program should calculate the `mex` value as the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation `p` up to that point. This can be done by iterating through the permutation `p` and finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the permutation.

Correctness: **False**
