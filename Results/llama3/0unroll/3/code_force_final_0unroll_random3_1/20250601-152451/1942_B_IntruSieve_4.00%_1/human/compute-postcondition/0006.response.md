Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a length and a list of integers. It then calculates and prints a list of values based on the input integers, iterating through the list and updating minimum and maximum values as it goes. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the calculated list of values, followed by the final values of the minimum and maximum values.**
