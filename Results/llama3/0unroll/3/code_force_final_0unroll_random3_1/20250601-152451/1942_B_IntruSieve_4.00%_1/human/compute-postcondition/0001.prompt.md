Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, arr is a list of integers of length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0, stdin contains (n - 1) inputs: each input is a test case consisting of two inputs: the first input is an integer (length of p and a) (1 <= length of p and a <= 2 * 10^5), and the second input is a space-separated list of integers (elements of array a) (-length of p and a <= elements of array a <= length of p and a)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
