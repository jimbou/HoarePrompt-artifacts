Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation p based on the given array a. The issue lies in the way the program updates the mex (minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array) value.

In the program, the mex value is updated as `minn += 1` when `arr[i] > 0`. However, this is not correct because the mex value should be updated based on the actual values in the permutation p, not just the indices.

For example, consider the input `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`. The correct permutation p should be `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`. However, the program will output `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` because it incorrectly updates the mex value.

To fix this issue, the program needs to keep track of the actual values in the permutation p and update the mex value accordingly. One possible solution is to use a set to keep track of the values in p and update the mex value based on the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set.

Here is an example of a corrected program:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    mex = set()
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            p.append(min(mex))
            mex.add(min(mex))
        else:
            p.append(abs(arr[i] - min(mex)))
            mex.add(abs(arr[i] - min(mex)))
    for itm in p:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```
This program uses a set `mex` to keep track of the values in the permutation p and updates the mex value based on the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set. This ensures that the program correctly constructs the permutation p based on the given array a.
