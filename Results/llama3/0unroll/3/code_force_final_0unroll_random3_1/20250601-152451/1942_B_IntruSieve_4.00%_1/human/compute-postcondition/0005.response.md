Output: **The loop will iterate n times. In each iteration, if the current element in the array is positive, the minimum value (minn) will be appended to the mex list, and minn will be incremented by 1. If minn equals maxx, minn will be set to maxx + 1. If the current element is not positive, the absolute difference between the current element and minn will be appended to the mex list. If this difference is greater than maxx, maxx will be updated to this difference. After the loop finishes, the mex list will contain the calculated values, and minn and maxx will hold their final values. The mex list is printed.**
