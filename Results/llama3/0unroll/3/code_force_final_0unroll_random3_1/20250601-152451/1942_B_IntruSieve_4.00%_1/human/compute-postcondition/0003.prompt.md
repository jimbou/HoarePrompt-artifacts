Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will iterate n times. In each iteration, if the current element in the array is positive, the minimum value (minn) will be appended to the mex list, and minn will be incremented by 1. If minn equals maxx, minn will be set to maxx + 1. If the current element is not positive, the absolute difference between the current element and minn will be appended to the mex list. If this difference is greater than maxx, maxx will be updated to this difference. After the loop finishes, the mex list will contain the calculated values, and minn and maxx will hold their final values.
Code of the loop:
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
