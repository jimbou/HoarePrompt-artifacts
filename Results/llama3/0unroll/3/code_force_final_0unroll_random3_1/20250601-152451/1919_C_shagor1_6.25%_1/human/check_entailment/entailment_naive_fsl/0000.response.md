Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array is in non-decreasing order. In this case, the program should return 0, but it returns a non-zero value.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program should return 0, but it returns 3.

The issue is in the line `x == y`. This line is not doing anything and is not updating the value of `x` or `y`. As a result, the program is not correctly handling the case when the input array is in non-decreasing order.

To fix this issue, the line `x == y` should be replaced with `x = y`. This will ensure that the program correctly handles the case when the input array is in non-decreasing order.

Here is the corrected code:
```
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        (*inp,) = map(int, input().split())
        x = y = n + 1
        ans = 0
        for a in inp:
            if a <= x:
                x = a
            elif a <= y:
                y = a
            else:
                x = y
                y = a
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
```
With this correction, the program should work correctly for all cases.
