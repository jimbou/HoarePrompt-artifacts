Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the list of integers. The second integer of the second line of each test case is the number of queries. The list of integers contains only positive integers. The queries are pairs of integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The value of b[i] is updated to be the sum of the previous value of b[i-1] and 1 if a[i] is greater than 1, or 2 if a[i] is 1, for all i from 1 to n. The values of n, q, and a remain unchanged.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [cumulative sum of a up to index 0], [cumulative sum of a up to index 1], ..., [cumulative sum of a up to index n-1]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `a` is updated to be the cumulative sum of its previous values, `n`, `q`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the value of b[i] is the sum of the previous value of b[i-1] and 1 if the cumulative sum of a up to index i is greater than 1, or 2 if the cumulative sum of a up to index i is 1, for all i from 1 to n, and the cumulative sum of a up to index i is being printed for all i from 0 to n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, two space-separated integers, a list of integers, and multiple lines of queries. It calculates the cumulative sum of the list of integers and prints it. Then, for each query, it checks if the cumulative sum of the list up to the second index is greater than or equal to the sum of the previous values plus 1 (or 2 if the cumulative sum is 1) and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. The function does not modify the input values except for the cumulative sum calculation.
