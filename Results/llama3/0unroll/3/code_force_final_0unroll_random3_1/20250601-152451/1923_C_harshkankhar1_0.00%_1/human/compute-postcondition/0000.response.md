Output State: **n is an integer, q is an integer, a is a list of positive integers of length n+1, b is a list of zeros of length n+1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs to `n` and `q`, respectively. The second line assigns a list of positive integers from the third input to `a`, with a prepended 0. The third line assigns a list of zeros to `b`, with a length of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is an integer, and the value of `q` is an integer. The list `a` contains only positive integers and has a length of `n + 1`. The list `b` contains only zeros and has a length of `n + 1`. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
