The `print(*a)` statement will print the updated values of the list `a`, which is the cumulative sum of its previous values.

Since the initial state describes the updates to the list `a` based on the cumulative sum of its previous values, we can infer that the printed values will be the cumulative sum of the previous values of `a` up to each index.

However, without knowing the exact initial values of `a`, `n`, `q`, and `b`, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the cumulative sum.

Therefore, the output will be the cumulative sum of the previous values of `a` up to each index, which can be described as:

Output: **[cumulative sum of a up to index 0], [cumulative sum of a up to index 1], ..., [cumulative sum of a up to index n-1]**
