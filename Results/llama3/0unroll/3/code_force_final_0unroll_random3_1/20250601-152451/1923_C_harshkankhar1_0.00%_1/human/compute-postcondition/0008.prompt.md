You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the list of integers. The second integer of the second line of each test case is the number of queries. The list of integers contains only positive integers. The queries are pairs of integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The value of b[i] is updated to be the sum of the previous value of b[i-1] and 1 if a[i] is greater than 1, or 2 if a[i] is 1, for all i from 1 to n. The values of n, q, and a remain unchanged.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [cumulative sum of a up to index 0], [cumulative sum of a up to index 1], ..., [cumulative sum of a up to index n-1]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `a` is updated to be the cumulative sum of its previous values, `n`, `q`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the value of b[i] is the sum of the previous value of b[i-1] and 1 if the cumulative sum of a up to index i is greater than 1, or 2 if the cumulative sum of a up to index i is 1, for all i from 1 to n, and the cumulative sum of a up to index i is being printed for all i from 0 to n.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
