Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, two space-separated integers, a list of integers, and multiple lines of queries. It calculates the cumulative sum of the list of integers and prints it. Then, for each query, it checks if the cumulative sum of the list up to the second index is greater than or equal to the sum of the previous values plus 1 (or 2 if the cumulative sum is 1) and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. The function does not modify the input values except for the cumulative sum calculation.**
