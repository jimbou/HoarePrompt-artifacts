Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first calculates the cumulative sum of the array `a` and stores it in `a` itself. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. Then, it calculates the array `b` where `b[i]` is the sum of the previous value of `b[i-1]` and 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, or 2 if `a[i]` is 1. This is done to count the number of elements in the subarray that need to be increased by 1 to make the subarray good.

3. For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than the count of elements that need to be increased `b[y] - b[x - 1]`. If this condition is true, it means that the subarray cannot be made good by increasing some elements by 1, so it prints 'NO'. If the condition is false, it checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, it means that the subarray has only one element, so it cannot be made good, and it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions, and it does so efficiently by using the cumulative sum array `a` and the count array `b`.

Correctness: **True**
