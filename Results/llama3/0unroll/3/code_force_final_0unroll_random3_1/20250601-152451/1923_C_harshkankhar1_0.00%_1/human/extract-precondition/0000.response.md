Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three inputs: first an integer, then two space-separated integers, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two space-separated integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of the second line of each test case is the length of the list of integers. The second integer of the second line of each test case is the number of queries. The list of integers contains only positive integers. The queries are pairs of integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n.**
