Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a, b, and c are equal (e.g., 0 0 0). According to the problem description, this should output "NONE", but the program outputs "STAIRS" because it only checks if a < b < c, and does not handle the case where a = b = c.

Additionally, the program has a typo in the output for the "STAIR" case, it should be "STAIR" instead of "STAIRS".
