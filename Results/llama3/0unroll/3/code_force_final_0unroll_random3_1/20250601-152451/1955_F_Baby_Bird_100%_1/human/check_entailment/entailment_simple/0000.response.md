Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then iterates over each test case.
* For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` from the input, representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
* The program then calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. This is done by summing up the calculated values for each of the four integers in the sequence, divided by 3.
* The calculated values are based on the observation that Bob can win if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. This happens when the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence is even. The program uses the formula `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` to calculate the number of times Bob can win for each integer `x` in the sequence. The `//` operator performs integer division, and the `%` operator calculates the remainder.
* The program prints the results of the calculations for each test case, separated by newline characters.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The formula used to calculate the number of times Bob can win for each integer in the sequence is correct, and the program correctly sums up these values and divides by 3 to get the final result.

Correctness: **True**
