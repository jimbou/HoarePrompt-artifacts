Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice in a game where Eve removes numbers optimally. The game's winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of the numbers in the sequence.

The provided Python program uses a list comprehension to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. `int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
2. `map(int, input().split())`: Reads the four integers for each test case and converts them to integers.
3. `enumerate(...)`: Iterates over the four integers with their indices.
4. `(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3))`: Calculates the contribution of each integer to the total count. This expression is based on the observation that:
	* For each pair of identical numbers (e.g., two 1s or two 2s), Bob can win once.
	* For each single number (e.g., one 1 or one 3), Bob can win once if it's not the last number removed (i.e., `i < 3`).
5. `sum(...)`: Calculates the total count for each test case.
6. `// 3`: Divides the total count by 3, as each win requires three numbers to be removed.
7. `str(...)`: Converts the result to a string.
8. `'\n'.join(...)`: Joins the results for all test cases with newline characters.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win. However, there is a minor issue: the program does not handle the case where the input contains non-integer values or values outside the specified range (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200). While the problem statement assumes valid inputs, a robust program should include input validation to handle potential errors.

Correctness: **True** (assuming valid inputs)
