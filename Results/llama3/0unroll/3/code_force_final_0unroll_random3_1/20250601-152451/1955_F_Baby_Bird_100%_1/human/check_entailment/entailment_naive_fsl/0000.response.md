Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice. The problem description states that Eve removes numbers optimally, but the program does not take this into account. It simply calculates the sum of the numbers divided by 3, which is not the correct approach.

A correct solution would involve analyzing the possible moves of Eve and determining the maximum number of times Bob can win based on those moves. The program does not do this, and therefore, it is incorrect.

For example, consider the input `1 1 1 0`. The program outputs `1`, but the correct output is `1` only if Eve removes the numbers in a specific order. If Eve removes the numbers in a different order, Bob may not win at all. The program does not account for this possibility, and therefore, it is incorrect.
