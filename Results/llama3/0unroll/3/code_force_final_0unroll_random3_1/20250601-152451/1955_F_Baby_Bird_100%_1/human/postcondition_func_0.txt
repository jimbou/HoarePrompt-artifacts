This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four integers. It calculates a value for each test case by summing the result of a specific formula applied to each integer, and then prints the results of these calculations, one per line, where each result is the sum of the calculated values divided by 3. The function does not modify the input data and does not return any value, only printing the results to the console.
