The code prints the sum of the products of each integer p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200) in the input, multiplied by 3 and divided by 3, for each line of input, where the product is calculated as 3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for each integer x in the line, and the sum is divided by 3. The output is a string where each sum is printed on a new line.
Output: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: the sum of the products of each integer p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200) in the input, multiplied by 3 and divided by 3, for each line of input, where the product is calculated as 3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for each integer x in the line, and the sum is divided by 3.**
