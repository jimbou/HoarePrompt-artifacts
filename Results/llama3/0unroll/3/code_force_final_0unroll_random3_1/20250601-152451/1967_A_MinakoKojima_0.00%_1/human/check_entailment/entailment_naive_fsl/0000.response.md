Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum score that can be obtained. The issue lies in the way it calculates the answer when `k` is less than `n * m`. The program tries to distribute the remaining `k` coins among the cards, but it does not consider the optimal way to do so.

A counterexample is when `n = 3`, `k = 4`, and `a = [6, 1, 8]`. The program will output `22`, but the correct answer is `15`. The optimal rearrangement is `[3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3]`, which contains `15` subarrays that are a permutation of `[1, 2, 3]`.

The program's mistake is that it tries to make all cards have the same number of occurrences, but this is not always the optimal strategy. In this case, it would be better to make the cards with `1` and `2` have more occurrences, and the card with `3` have fewer occurrences.
