Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements of the array in non-decreasing order, given the constraint that the sum of the elements does not exceed k. It prints the result for each test case.**
