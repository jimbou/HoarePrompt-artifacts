Functionality: **This function reads input from the standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console for each test case. The function determines whether it is possible to make three input strings identical by changing one or more characters in the first two strings, but not in the third string. The function processes a specified number of test cases, and the output is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, one for each test case.**
