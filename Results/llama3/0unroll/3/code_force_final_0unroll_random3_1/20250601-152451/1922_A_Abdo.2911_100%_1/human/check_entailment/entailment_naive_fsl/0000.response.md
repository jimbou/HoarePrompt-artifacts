Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. It iterates through each character of the strings a, b, and c, and checks the conditions specified in the problem description.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

* If a[i] == b[i], it checks if c[i] != a[i]. If this condition is true, it sets possible to True and breaks the loop.
* If a[i] != b[i], it checks if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]. If this condition is true, it continues to the next iteration. If this condition is false, it sets possible to True and breaks the loop.

The program correctly prints "YES" if possible is True and "NO" if possible is False.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
