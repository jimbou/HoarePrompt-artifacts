The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters. After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input. The stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
