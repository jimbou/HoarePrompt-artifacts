Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c.
2. If the characters at the current position in a and b are the same, it checks if the character at the same position in c is different. If it is, it sets the `possible` flag to True and breaks out of the loop.
3. If the characters at the current position in a and b are different, it checks if the character at the same position in c is the same as either the character in a or the character in b. If it is not, it sets the `possible` flag to True and breaks out of the loop.
4. After iterating over all characters, it checks the `possible` flag. If it is True, it prints 'YES', indicating that there exists a template t that satisfies the conditions. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
