Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases, the length of the strings, and the strings themselves.
2. The program iterates over each test case and checks each character of the strings a, b, and c.
3. The program correctly implements the conditions for a string to match a template:
	* If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i. This is checked by `a[i] == b[i]`.
	* If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i. This is checked by `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]`.
4. The program correctly sets the `possible` flag to True if it finds a character that satisfies the conditions for a string to match a template.
5. The program correctly prints 'YES' if the `possible` flag is True and 'NO' otherwise.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Correctness: **True**
