Functionality: **This function reads a number of test cases from standard input, then for each test case, it reads a positive integer, converts it to its binary representation, performs a series of bit manipulation operations on it, and prints the transformed binary representation along with its length. The bit manipulation operations involve flipping bits, setting bits, and potentially appending an additional bit to the end of the representation. The function executes this process for each test case, producing a transformed binary representation for each input integer.**
