Output State: **The loop will execute 't' number of times, where 't' is the number of test cases. For each test case, it will read a positive integer 'x' from the standard input. It will then convert the binary representation of 'x' into a list of characters 's', where '1' represents a set bit and '0' represents an unset bit. It will then perform a series of operations on 's' to transform it into a new binary representation. The transformed binary representation will be printed to the standard output, along with its length. The output will be in the format of a list of characters, where '1' represents a set bit, '0' represents an unset bit, and '-1' represents a bit that has been flipped. The length of the transformed binary representation will also be printed.**
