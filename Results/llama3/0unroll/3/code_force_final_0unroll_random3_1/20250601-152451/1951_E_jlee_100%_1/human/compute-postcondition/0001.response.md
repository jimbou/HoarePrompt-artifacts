The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line of stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. 

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the first line of stdin. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters)**
