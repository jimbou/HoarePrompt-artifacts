Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads the first line of stdin, which contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.
	* `int()` converts the input string to an integer.
	* The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Since `t` is now assigned a value, we can conclude that:

* `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
* The first line of stdin has been consumed, leaving the remaining test cases in stdin.

The output state is:

**`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of a string s of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6).**

Note that the value of `t` is now known, and we can use this information to reason about the subsequent code.
