Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It then checks if it's possible to split the string into two non-empty substrings that do not start with the same character as the original string. If possible, it outputs 'YES', the minimum number of splits required (1 or 2), and the resulting substrings. If not possible, it outputs 'NO'. The function iterates through all test cases and outputs the results for each case.**
