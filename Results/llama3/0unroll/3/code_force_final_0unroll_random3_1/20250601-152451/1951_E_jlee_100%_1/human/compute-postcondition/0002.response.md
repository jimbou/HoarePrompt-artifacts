Output State: **The loop will output 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to split the string into two non-empty substrings that are not equal to the first character of the string. If 'YES', it will also output the minimum number of splits required (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. The loop will iterate through all test cases and output the results for each case.**
