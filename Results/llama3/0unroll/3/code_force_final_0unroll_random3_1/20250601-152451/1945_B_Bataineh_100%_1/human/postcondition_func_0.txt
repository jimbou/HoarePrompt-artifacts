This function reads a series of input sets from standard input, where each set contains three integers: a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make 'a' and 'b' equal to 'm' for each set of inputs. The number of operations is determined based on the relative values of a, b, and m, and the function handles all possible cases. The function outputs a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of operations required for each input set.
