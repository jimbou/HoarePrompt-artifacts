Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It then divides the range of n into chunks of size k, assigns a unique integer to each chunk (starting from 1), and repeats this integer k times in the chunk. The function prints the resulting sequence of integers, the number of chunks (ceiling of n divided by k), and a list of n zeros. The function does not return any values, but rather prints the results directly.**
