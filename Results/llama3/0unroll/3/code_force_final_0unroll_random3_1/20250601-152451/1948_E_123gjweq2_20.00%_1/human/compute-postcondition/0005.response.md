Output: **The output state is a positive integer n and a positive integer k such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n, cliques is an integer equal to the ceiling of n divided by k, arr is a list of n integers where each integer from index i * k to min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1) is equal to i + 1, cliquess is a list of n zeros, and the elements of arr are printed: [i + 1] from index i * k to min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1) for each i, and the number of cliques which is equal to the ceiling of n divided by k is printed**
