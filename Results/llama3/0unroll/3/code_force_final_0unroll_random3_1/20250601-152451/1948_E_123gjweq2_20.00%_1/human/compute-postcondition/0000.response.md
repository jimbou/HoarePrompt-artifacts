Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliques are lists of length at least right + 1, arr is empty, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, and not_mid is right - left + 1 - mid.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliques` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces four new variables: `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`. The values of these variables are calculated based on the values of `left` and `right`. Specifically, `small_element` is set to `left + 1`, `big_element` is set to `right + 1`, `mid` is set to the integer division of `big_element - small_element` by 2, and `not_mid` is set to `right - left + 1 - mid`.
