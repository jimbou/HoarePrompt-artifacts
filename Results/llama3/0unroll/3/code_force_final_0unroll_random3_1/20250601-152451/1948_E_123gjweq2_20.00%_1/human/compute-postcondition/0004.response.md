Functionality: **The function populates a specified range in two lists, `arr` and `cliques`, with values based on the input parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It sets the elements in the first half of the range in `arr` to incrementing values starting from `left + 1`, and the elements in the second half to decrementing values starting from `right + 1`. The corresponding elements in `cliques` are set to the value of `clique`. The function modifies the input lists `arr` and `cliques` in place, and does not return any value.**
