Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly assigns distinct integers to each vertex and partitions the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques. The program uses a greedy approach to assign the integers, starting from the smallest available integer and assigning it to the leftmost available vertex, and then assigning the largest available integer to the rightmost available vertex. This approach ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.

The program also correctly handles the case where `n` is not a multiple of `k`, by using the `ceil` function to calculate the number of cliques. This ensures that the program works correctly even when `n` is not a multiple of `k`.

I have tested the program with several test cases, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I have also tried to come up with edge cases where the program might fail, but I was unable to find any.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
