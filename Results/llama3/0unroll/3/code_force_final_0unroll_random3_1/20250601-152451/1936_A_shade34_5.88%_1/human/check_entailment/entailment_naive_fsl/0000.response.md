Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum value in the permutation, and then finds the second maximum value by comparing the remaining elements with the maximum value. The program also handles the case where there are multiple maximum values by finding the first occurrence of the maximum value.

The program uses at most 3n queries, as required by the problem statement. It first finds the maximum value in at most n queries, and then finds the second maximum value in at most 2n queries.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to handle all possible inputs and edge cases correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
