Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum element in the array, and then finds the second maximum element. The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program:

1. The program first finds the maximum element in the array by comparing each element with the current maximum element. This is done using the `?` queries, where the program asks for the comparison between the current maximum element and the current element.

2. Once the maximum element is found, the program finds all elements that are equal to the maximum element. This is done by comparing each element with the maximum element using the `?` queries.

3. The program then finds the second maximum element among the elements that are equal to the maximum element. This is done by comparing each element with the current second maximum element using the `?` queries.

4. Finally, the program outputs the indices of the maximum and second maximum elements in the format `! mak2 mak`, where `mak2` is the index of the maximum element and `mak` is the index of the second maximum element.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The program also correctly finds the maximum and second maximum elements in the array.

Correctness: **True**
