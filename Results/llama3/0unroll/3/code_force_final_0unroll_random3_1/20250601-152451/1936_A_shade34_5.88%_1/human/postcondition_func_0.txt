This function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^4) and then finds the indices of the maximum and second maximum elements in a sequence of n elements. The function outputs the indices of the maximum and second maximum elements for each test case in the format "! mak2 mak", where mak2 is the index of the maximum element and mak is the index of the second maximum element. The indices are 1-based.
