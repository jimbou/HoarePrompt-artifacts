Output State: **The output state is a series of print statements, where each iteration of the loop prints three lines: "1 1", "1 2", and "i i" for i ranging from 3 to the input number n. The number of iterations is equal to the initial input number. The stdin contains no more inputs after the loop finishes execution.**
