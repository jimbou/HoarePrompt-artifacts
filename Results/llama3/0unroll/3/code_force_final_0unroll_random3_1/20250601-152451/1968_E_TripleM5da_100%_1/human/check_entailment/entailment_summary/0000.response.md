Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints a series of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program does not actually solve the problem correctly. The program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n, but this does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), but the optimal solution is actually the points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), as shown in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
