Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints out the coordinates of n cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program starts by printing the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for all values of n. This is because these two points are always part of the optimal solution, as they have a Manhattan distance of 1, which is the smallest possible distance.

Then, for n greater than or equal to 3, the program prints the coordinates (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n. This is because these points have a Manhattan distance of i - 1 from the point (1, 1), which is a distinct distance for each i.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case when n is 2. In this case, the program prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2), but it should also print the coordinates (2, 1) to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the given program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
