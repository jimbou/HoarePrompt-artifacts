Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the program only prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (i, i) for i from 3 to n. This does not guarantee the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the optimal arrangement is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
