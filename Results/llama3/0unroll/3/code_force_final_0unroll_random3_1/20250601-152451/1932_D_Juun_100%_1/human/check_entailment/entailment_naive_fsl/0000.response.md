Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when there are multiple cards of the same suit but different ranks that are not trump cards. In this case, the program will not be able to reconstruct the rounds correctly.

For example, if the input is:

3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S 5D 8D

The program will not be able to correctly reconstruct the rounds because it will try to pair the 5D and 8D with the 6D, but it will not be able to do so because the 6D is already paired with the 9S.

The program should be modified to handle this case by keeping track of the cards of each suit and their ranks, and then pairing them up correctly.
