stdin contains a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16). The second line contains a single character, the trump suit. The third line contains a space-separated list of 2n cards. Each card is a two-character string, the first character is the rank of the card, which is one of "23456789", and the second one is the suit of the card, which is one of "CDHS". All cards are different.
