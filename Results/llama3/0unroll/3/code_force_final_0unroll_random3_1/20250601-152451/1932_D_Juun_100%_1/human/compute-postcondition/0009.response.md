Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, a trump suit, and a list of 2n cards. It then generates a list of answers based on the cards and the trump suit, and prints out the answers in a specific format. If it's impossible to generate answers, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns. The function does not return any value, but instead prints out the results directly.**
