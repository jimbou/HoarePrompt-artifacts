stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character representing the trump suit, and a space-separated list of 2n distinct cards, where each card is a two-character string with the first character being the rank and the second character being the suit.
