#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), the second line contains a character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and the third line contains 2n space-separated two-character strings, each representing a card with a rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and a suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S').

    trumps = []

    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: stdin contains t-2 test cases, trump is a character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), trumps is a list of ranks of cards of the trump suit, answers is a list of strings, each representing a pair of cards of the same suit in ascending order, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values are either None or a rank of a card.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:

            return
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has iterated over the suits dictionary, and for each suit with a non-None rank, it has appended a string representing a pair of cards of the same suit in ascending order to the answers list. If the trumps list is not empty, it has popped the last element from the trumps list and appended it to the answers list along with the trump suit. If the trumps list is empty, it has printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned from the function. The stdin, trump, and suits variables remain unchanged.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: trumps is an empty list.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: trumps is still an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and prints pairs of cards of the same suit in ascending order. It handles cases where the trump suit is involved and ensures that all cards are paired correctly. If it's impossible to pair the cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. The function ultimately prints all possible pairs of cards, including those involving the trump suit, in ascending order.
