This function reads input from stdin, processes a series of test cases, and prints pairs of cards of the same suit in ascending order. It handles cases where the trump suit is involved and ensures that all cards are paired correctly. If it's impossible to pair the cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. The function ultimately prints all possible pairs of cards, including those involving the trump suit, in ascending order.
