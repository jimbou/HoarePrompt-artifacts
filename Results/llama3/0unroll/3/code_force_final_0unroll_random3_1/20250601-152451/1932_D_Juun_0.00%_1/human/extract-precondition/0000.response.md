Precondition: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), the second line contains a character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and the third line contains 2n space-separated two-character strings, each representing a card with a rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and a suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S').**
