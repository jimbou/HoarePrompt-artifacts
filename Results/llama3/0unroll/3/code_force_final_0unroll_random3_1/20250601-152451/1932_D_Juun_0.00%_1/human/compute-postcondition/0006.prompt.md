Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has iterated over the suits dictionary, and for each suit with a non-None rank, it has appended a string representing a pair of cards of the same suit in ascending order to the answers list. If the trumps list is not empty, it has popped the last element from the trumps list and appended it to the answers list along with the trump suit. If the trumps list is empty, it has printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned from the function. The stdin, trump, and suits variables remain unchanged. The trumps list is now sorted in ascending order.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
