Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Function `func_1` calculates the minimum value between the number of integers in the input list 'a' that appear exactly twice and half of the total number of integers in 'a'. This is the key insight to solve the problem because it represents the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, parses it into a list of strings, and then processes the input data in a loop. In each iteration, it extracts a positive integer 'n' and a list of 'n' positive integers 'a' from the input data, passes them to the `func_1` function, and appends the result to the 'results' list. After processing all input data, it prints each result from the 'results' list.

Since `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally and `func_2` correctly reads the input data and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
