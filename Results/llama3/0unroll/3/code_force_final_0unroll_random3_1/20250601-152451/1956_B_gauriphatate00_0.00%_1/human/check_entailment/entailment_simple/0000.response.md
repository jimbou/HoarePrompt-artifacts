Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. It uses a `Counter` object to count the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. Then, it calculates the number of pairs of integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. The function returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and half of the total number of integers in the list `a`. This is because the player can score points only by playing a card that has a pair on the table, and the maximum number of pairs that can be played is half of the total number of integers.

The function `func_2` is also correct. It reads the input data from the standard input, parses it into a list of integers, and calls the function `func_1` for each test case. The results are stored in a list and then printed to the standard output.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
