Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, given the cards in their hand and the optimal play of their opponent.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes the number of cards `n` and the list of cards in the player's hand `a` as input. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each card in the hand. Then, it calculates the number of pairs of cards with the same value by summing up the counts that are equal to 2. Finally, it returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which represents the maximum number of points the player can score.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input data from the standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

The reasoning behind `func_1` is correct. By counting the pairs of cards with the same value, we can determine the maximum number of points the player can score. The `min` function is used to ensure that the player does not score more points than the total number of pairs available.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the problem statement, it is mentioned that each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the deck. Therefore, the input list `a` will always contain at most two occurrences of each integer. In this case, the `Counter` class is not necessary, and the program can be simplified.

Despite this minor issue, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
