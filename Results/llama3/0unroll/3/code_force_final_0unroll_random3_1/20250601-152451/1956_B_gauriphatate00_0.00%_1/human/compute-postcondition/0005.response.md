Functionality: **Reads input from standard input, parses it into a list of strings, and then processes the input data in a loop. In each iteration, it extracts a positive integer 'n' and a list of 'n' positive integers 'a' from the input data, passes them to the 'func_1' function, and appends the result to the 'results' list. After processing all input data, it prints each result from the 'results' list. The function does not return any value, and its output is solely through printing the results.**
