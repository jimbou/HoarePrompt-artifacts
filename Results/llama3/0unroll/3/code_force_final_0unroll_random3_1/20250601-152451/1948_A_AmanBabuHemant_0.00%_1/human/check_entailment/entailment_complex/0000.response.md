Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers. For each subsequent integer n, if n is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of '110' repeated n/2 times. If n is odd, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies that if n is odd, it is impossible to build a string with exactly n special characters, since each special character must have a neighbor that is the same. Therefore, it prints 'NO' in this case.

If n is even, the program constructs a string of '110' repeated n/2 times. This string has exactly n special characters, since each '1' is a special character and each '0' is not. The length of this string is at most 200, as required by the problem statement.

The program's output is also correct, as it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string when n is even, and 'NO' when n is odd.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
