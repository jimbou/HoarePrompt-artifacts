Output State: **The output state will contain a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, followed by a series of strings of '110' repeated a certain number of times, depending on the input integers. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings will be equal to the number of input integers. If an input integer is even, the output will contain a 'YES' string followed by a string of '110' repeated n/2 times. If an input integer is odd, the output will contain a 'NO' string.**
