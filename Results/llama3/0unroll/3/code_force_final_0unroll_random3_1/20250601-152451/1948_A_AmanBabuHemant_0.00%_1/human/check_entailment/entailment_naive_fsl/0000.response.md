Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is even and greater than 200. In this case, the program will print 'YES' and then print a string of length more than 200, which is not allowed according to the problem description. The problem description states that the answer string should be of length at most 200.

For example, if n = 202, the program will print 'YES' and then print a string of length 220, which is not a valid solution.
