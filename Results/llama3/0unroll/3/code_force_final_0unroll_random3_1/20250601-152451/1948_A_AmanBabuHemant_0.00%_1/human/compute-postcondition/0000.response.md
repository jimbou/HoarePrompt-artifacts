The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50) and then `t` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50). So, after the code is executed, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, and stdin contains `t` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains `t` integers `n` (1 <= n <= 50).**
