This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers. For each subsequent integer n, if n is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of '110' repeated n/2 times. If n is odd, it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process for all t input integers, producing a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, potentially followed by strings of '110' repeated a certain number of times.
