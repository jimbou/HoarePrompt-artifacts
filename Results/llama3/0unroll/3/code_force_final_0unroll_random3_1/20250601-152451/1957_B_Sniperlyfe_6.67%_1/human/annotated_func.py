#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `nums` is a list of `n` values, where each value is the maximum possible value that can be represented by `k` bits, and `k` is 0.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of n values, where the last value is 1 and the rest are 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of n values, where each value is the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits, and then adjusts the last value to include any remaining amount from k. The function returns this list, effectively distributing the value of k across n values, with the last value being the sum of the remaining amount and the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits.
