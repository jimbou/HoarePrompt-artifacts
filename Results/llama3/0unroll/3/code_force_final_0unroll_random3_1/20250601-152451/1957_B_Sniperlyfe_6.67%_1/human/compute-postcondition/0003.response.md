Output State: **`nums` is a list of `n` values, where the last value is 1 and the rest are 0, and `k` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `nums[-1]` has been incremented by `k`, which is 0. Since `nums` is a list of `n` values, where each value is the maximum possible value that can be represented by `k` bits, and `k` is 0, the maximum possible value is 0. However, since `nums[-1]` has been incremented by 0, its value is now 1. The rest of the values in the list remain 0. The value of `k` remains 0.
