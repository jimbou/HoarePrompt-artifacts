Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is 1 and `k` is any value. In this case, the program should return a single integer `k`, but instead, it returns an array with a single element `k-1` (because `nums[-1] += k` is executed after `k` has been decremented by `nums[i]` in the loop).

For example, for the input `1 5`, the program returns `[4]` instead of `[5]`.
