Output State: **`nums` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9**

In this output state, `nums` is a list of `n` zeros, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The value of `k` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
