Functionality: **This function generates a list of n values, where each value is the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits, and then adjusts the last value to include any remaining amount from k. The function returns this list, effectively distributing the value of k across n values, with the last value being the sum of the remaining amount and the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits.**
