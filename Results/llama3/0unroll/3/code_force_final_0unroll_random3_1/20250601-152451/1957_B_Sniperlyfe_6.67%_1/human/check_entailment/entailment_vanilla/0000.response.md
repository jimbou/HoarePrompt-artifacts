Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k, such that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases t and initializes an empty list results to store the output for each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k, and calls the function func_1 to generate the sequence of integers.

3. The function func_1 initializes a list nums of size n with all elements set to 0.

4. It then enters a loop that runs n times. In each iteration, it calculates the value of the current integer as (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1. This value is the maximum possible value that can be assigned to the current integer without exceeding k.

5. The value of k is then reduced by the value of the current integer.

6. After the loop, the last integer in the sequence is incremented by the remaining value of k. This ensures that the sum of all integers in the sequence equals k.

7. The function returns the list of integers.

8. The program appends the result of each test case to the results list and finally prints all the results.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. However, there is a potential issue with the program. The problem statement guarantees that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, but it does not guarantee that the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed a certain limit. If the sum of k is very large, the program may exceed the maximum limit for an integer in Python, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**
