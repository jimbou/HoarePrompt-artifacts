Reasoning:

The problem statement asks to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing no more than y additional vertices, given that Bessie has already chosen x vertices. However, since y is always 0 in this version of the problem, we cannot choose any additional vertices.

The program simply prints x - 2 for each test case. This is correct because with x chosen vertices, we can form x - 2 non-intersecting triangles. For example, if x = 4, we can form 2 triangles by connecting the chosen vertices in a cyclic manner.

Since the program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with the given x chosen vertices and no additional vertices (y = 0), it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
