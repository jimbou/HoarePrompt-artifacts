Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into a regular polygon with n sides. The given program simply prints `x - 2`, where `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

The key insight here is that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed is equal to the number of vertices Bessie has chosen minus 2. This is because each vertex can be used to form a triangle with two other vertices, and the number of such triangles is maximized when the vertices are chosen in a way that minimizes the number of intersecting diagonals.

The program correctly implements this insight by simply printing `x - 2`. The input values of `n`, `y`, and the array of vertices are not used in the calculation, which is correct because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake only depends on the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
