Output State: **t = 0, stdin is empty, n, x, y, and arr are undefined.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable t will be 0, the standard input (stdin) will be empty because all test cases have been processed, and the variables n, x, y, and arr will no longer have defined values because they were defined within the loop and their scope ends when the loop finishes.
