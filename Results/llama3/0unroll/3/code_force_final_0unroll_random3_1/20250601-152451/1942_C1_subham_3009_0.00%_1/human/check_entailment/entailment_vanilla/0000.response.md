Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are numbered from 1 to n clockwise, and Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form diagonals. The task is to choose no more than y other vertices such that the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the input, processes it, and prints the result. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and enters a while loop that runs `t` times.
2. In each iteration, the program reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, representing the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of other vertices that can be chosen, respectively.
3. The program then reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen and stores them in the array `arr`.
4. The program prints the result, which is simply `x - 2`.

The reasoning behind the program is as follows:

* Since Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, we can form `x - 2` non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by connecting these vertices with non-intersecting diagonals.
* The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed is `x - 2`, because each additional vertex can be used to form at most one more triangular piece.
* The value of `y` is not used in the program, because the problem statement specifies that `y = 0`, which means we cannot choose any additional vertices.

Based on this analysis, the program is correct, and the output will be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Correctness: **True**
