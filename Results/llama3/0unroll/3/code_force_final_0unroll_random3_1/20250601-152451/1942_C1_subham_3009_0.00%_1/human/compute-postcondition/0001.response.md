Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is larger than 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
