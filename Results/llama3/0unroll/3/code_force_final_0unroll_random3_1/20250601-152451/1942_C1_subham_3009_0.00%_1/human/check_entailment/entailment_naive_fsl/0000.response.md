Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description states that Bessie wants to choose no more than y other vertices such that the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized. However, the program simply prints x - 2, which is not necessarily the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained.

For example, consider the case where n = 8, x = 4, and y = 0. The program will print 2, but the correct answer is 6, as shown in the example output. This is because the program does not take into account the fact that the chosen vertices can be used to form multiple non-intersecting diagonals, which can result in more triangular pieces of cake.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct answer is False.
