Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. For each test case, it prints the value of x minus 2. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and the variables n, x, y, and arr undefined.**
