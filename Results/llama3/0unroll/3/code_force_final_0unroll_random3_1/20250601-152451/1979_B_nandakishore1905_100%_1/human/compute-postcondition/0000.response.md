Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer is the result of the calculation for each test case. The calculation is based on the absolute difference between the two input integers, and it follows these rules: if the difference is a power of 2, it prints the difference; if the difference is odd, it prints 1; otherwise, it subtracts the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the difference, and repeats this process until the result is a power of 2, then prints the result.**
