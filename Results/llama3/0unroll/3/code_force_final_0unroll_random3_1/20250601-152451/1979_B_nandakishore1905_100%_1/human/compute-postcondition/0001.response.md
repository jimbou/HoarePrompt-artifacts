Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two distinct non-negative integers. It calculates the absolute difference between the two integers and applies a set of rules to determine the output: if the difference is a power of 2, it prints the difference; if the difference is odd, it prints 1; otherwise, it repeatedly subtracts the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the difference until the result is a power of 2, then prints the result. The function outputs a list of integers, where each integer is the result of the calculation for each test case.**
