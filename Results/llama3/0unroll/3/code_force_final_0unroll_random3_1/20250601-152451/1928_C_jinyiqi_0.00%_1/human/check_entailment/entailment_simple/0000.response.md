Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. The constraints are that the settling exists if and only if k > 1, and the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.

The program first reads the input and then checks if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0 and (n - x) % 2 == 0. If either of these conditions is true, it calls the function func_1 to find the divisors of (n + x - 2) or (n - x). The function func_1 returns a list of divisors, which are then filtered to only include values that are greater than or equal to x and are of the form (s + 2) / 2, where s is a divisor.

The program then removes duplicates from the list of possible k values and prints the length of the list.

The function func_1 is designed to find the divisors of a given number x. It iterates over all numbers from 1 to the square root of x and checks if x is divisible by the current number. If it is, the number and its corresponding divisor (x / i) are added to the list of divisors. The list of divisors is then returned.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
