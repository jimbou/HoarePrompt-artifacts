Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different k values that fit the constraints of the "settling in the first-k-th position" problem. The program takes two integers as input, n and x, where n is Vasya's position in the line and x is the number Vasya received during the settling.

The program first checks if (n + x - 2) and (n - x) are even, and if so, it calculates the divisors of these numbers using the function func_1. The function returns a list of divisors, where divisors less than or equal to the square root are in reverse order and divisors greater than the square root are in the original order.

The program then checks each divisor to see if it meets the condition (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x. If it does, the divisor is added to the output list. The program also removes duplicates from the output list by converting it to a set.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. The function func_1 is also correctly implemented, and it returns the correct list of divisors.

Correctness: **True**
