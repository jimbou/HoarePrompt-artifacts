#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of two integers. The first integer is greater than the second integer. The second integer is greater than 1.
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: Output State: output1 is a list of divisors of x that are less than or equal to the square root of x, output2 is a list of divisors of x that are greater than the square root of x, x is unchanged.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that contains all the divisors of x, where divisors less than or equal to the square root of x are in reverse order and divisors greater than the square root of x are in the original order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than the second integer and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a list of all divisors of the first integer, with divisors less than or equal to the square root in reverse order and divisors greater than the square root in the original order. The input list remains unchanged.
