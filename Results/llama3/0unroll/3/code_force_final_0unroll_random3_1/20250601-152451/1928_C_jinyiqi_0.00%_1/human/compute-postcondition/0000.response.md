Output State: **x is a list of two integers. The first integer is greater than the second integer. The second integer is greater than 1, output1 is an empty list, output2 is an empty list.**

The code snippet initializes two empty lists, `output1` and `output2`, but does not modify the existing list `x`. Therefore, the state of `x` remains unchanged, with the first integer being greater than the second integer, and the second integer being greater than 1. The two new lists, `output1` and `output2`, are added to the state, both being empty.
