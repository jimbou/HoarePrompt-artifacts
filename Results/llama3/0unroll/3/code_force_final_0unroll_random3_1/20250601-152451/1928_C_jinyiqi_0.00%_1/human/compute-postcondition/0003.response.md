Output State: **output1 is a list of divisors of x that are less than or equal to the square root of x in reverse order, output2 is a list of divisors of x that are greater than the square root of x, x is unchanged.**

In this output state, the list output1 has been reversed, meaning that the order of its elements has been reversed. The elements themselves remain the same, i.e., they are still divisors of x that are less than or equal to the square root of x. The list output2 remains unchanged, as does the value of x.
