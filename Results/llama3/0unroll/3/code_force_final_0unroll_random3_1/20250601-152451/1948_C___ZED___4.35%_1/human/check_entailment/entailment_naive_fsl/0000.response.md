Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will print 'YES', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because the arrow in the cell (2, 3) points to the left, which would make the robot move out of the grid.

The program only checks if the arrow in the cell (2, n-1) points to the right and if all the arrows in the even columns of the second row point to the right. However, it does not consider the case where the arrow in the cell (2, n-1) points to the left and the robot cannot move to the cell (2, n) from the cell (2, n-1). 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
