Output State: **The output state will contain multiple lines of output, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, if the last but one character of the second string is not '>', the output will be 'NO'. If the length of the strings is 1, the output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES' if there is a path from the first string to the second string by moving two characters at a time, and 'NO' otherwise.**
