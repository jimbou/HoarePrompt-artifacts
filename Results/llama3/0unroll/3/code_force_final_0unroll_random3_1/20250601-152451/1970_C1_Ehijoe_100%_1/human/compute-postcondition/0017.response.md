Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph with n vertices and n-1 edges, identifies the nodes with degree 1, finds a path between these nodes, and determines whether a given starting node is closer to the first or last node in the path. Based on this, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' to the console, depending on whether the number of moves to the closest end of the path is odd or even.**
