Output State: **tree = [s, nodes[s][1], nodes[nodes[s][1]][1], ..., e], curr = e, prev = nodes[e][0].**

In the output state, the variable tree contains the path from node s to node e in the graph, represented as a list of node indices. The variable curr is set to e, indicating that the loop has reached the end node. The variable prev is set to the first neighbor of node e, which is the second-to-last node in the path from s to e.
