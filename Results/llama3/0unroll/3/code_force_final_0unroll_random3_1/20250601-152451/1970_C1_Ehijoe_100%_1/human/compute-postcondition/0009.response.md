Output State: **tree is [s, nodes[s][1], nodes[nodes[s][1]][1], ..., e, e], curr is e, prev is nodes[e][0], start is an integer, idx is the index of start in tree, moves is [idx, n - idx - 1], stdin contains no input**.

The code first appends the value of `e` to the `tree` list, resulting in a duplicate `e` at the end. Then, it reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `start`. The index of `start` in the `tree` list is found using the `index()` method and assigned to the variable `idx`. Finally, a list `moves` is created containing the index `idx` and the difference between the length of the tree `n` and `idx` minus 1. The values of `curr` and `prev` remain unchanged. Stdin is empty after the execution of the code.
