stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t, where n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive and t is 1, then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n inclusive, and finally one line containing one integer u, where u is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
