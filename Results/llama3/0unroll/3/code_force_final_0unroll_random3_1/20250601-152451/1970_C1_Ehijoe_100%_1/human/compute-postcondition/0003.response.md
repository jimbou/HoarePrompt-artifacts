Output State: **The variable t remains 1, the variable edges remains an empty list, the variable empty remains True, the variable nodes is a dictionary where each key is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, and each value is a list of integers between 1 and n inclusive, representing the adjacency list of a graph with n vertices and n-1 edges, the variable ends is an empty list, and the variable stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `ends` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
