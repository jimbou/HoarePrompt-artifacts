Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The variable t remains 1, the variable edges remains an empty list, the variable empty remains True, the variable nodes is a dictionary where each key is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, and each value is a list of integers between 1 and n inclusive, representing the adjacency list of a graph with n vertices and n-1 edges, the variable ends is a list of integers between 1 and n inclusive, representing the nodes with degree 1 in the graph, the variable stdin is empty, the variable s is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, the variable e is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, the variable tree is a list containing the integer s, the variable prev is the integer s, and the variable curr is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the first neighbor of s in the graph.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
