Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is an empty dictionary, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers between 1 and n inclusive, and finally one integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs to `n` and `t`, respectively. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, and `t` is 1, these values are assigned to the variables. The second line initializes an empty list `edges`. The third line sets the boolean variable `empty` to `True`. The fourth line creates an empty dictionary `nodes` using the `defaultdict` class. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing `n-1` lines each with two integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, and finally one integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
