Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer. It updates the minimum count whenever it encounters a different integer.

The program correctly handles the edge case where the array consists of identical numbers, in which case it outputs -1. It also correctly handles the case where the array has only one element, in which case it outputs -1.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array has only two distinct elements, and the minimum count is 1. In this case, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be -1, because removing one element will not make the array stop being beautiful.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
