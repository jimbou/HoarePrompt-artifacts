Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program iterates through the array, keeping track of the number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer. It updates the minimum count whenever it encounters a different integer.

The program correctly handles the case where the array consists of identical numbers, in which case it outputs -1. It also correctly handles the case where the array has multiple segments of consecutive occurrences of the same integer, and outputs the minimum count among these segments.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has only one segment of consecutive occurrences of the same integer. In this case, the program will output the length of this segment, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer should be -1, because removing any number of elements from this segment will still result in a beautiful array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
