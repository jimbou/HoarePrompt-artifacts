Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer in a list of integers. The program iterates through the list, keeping track of the current number and the count of consecutive occurrences. When it encounters a different number, it updates the minimum count if necessary. Finally, it prints the minimum count or -1 if no such integer exists.

The program handles multiple test cases and edge cases correctly, such as when the list contains only one unique integer or when the list is empty.

Correctness: **True**
