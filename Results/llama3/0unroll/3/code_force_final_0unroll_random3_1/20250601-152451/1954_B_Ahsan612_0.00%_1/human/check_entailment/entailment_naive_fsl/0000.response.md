Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only one distinct element. In this case, the program will output the length of the array, but it should output -1 because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

For example, if the input is:

3
3
1 1 1

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be -1.

The issue is that the program does not handle the case when the minimum length of the same elements is equal to the length of the array. In this case, it should output -1, but instead, it outputs the length of the array.
