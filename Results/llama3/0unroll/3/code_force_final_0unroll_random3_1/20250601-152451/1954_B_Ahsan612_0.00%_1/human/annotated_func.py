#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:

    #State: The output state contains t lines, each containing the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer in the corresponding list of integers. If no such integer exists, the output is -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same integer in each list of integers. It handles multiple test cases and outputs the result for each case, or -1 if no such integer exists.
