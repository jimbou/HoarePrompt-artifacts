Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and initializes the arrays `p` and `a`.
2.  It correctly adjusts the indices of `P_B` and `P_S` by subtracting 1 to match the 0-based indexing of the arrays.
3.  The program initializes the variables `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` to keep track of the scores and maximum scores for both players.
4.  The loop iterates `k` times, updating the positions of both players and calculating their scores. It correctly updates the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` based on the current scores and the remaining turns.
5.  After the loop, the program compares the maximum scores `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner and prints the corresponding result.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
