Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game between Bodya and Sasha based on the input test cases. The program accurately updates the scores of both players by iterating through the permutation and adding the values from the array a. The program also correctly determines the winner of the game by comparing the final scores of both players.

The program handles the case where k is greater than the length of the permutation by using the modulo operator to ensure that the indices of the permutation and array a remain within bounds. This prevents the program from accessing invalid indices and ensures that the simulation is accurate.

The program also correctly handles the case where the scores of both players are equal by printing "Draw".

Overall, the program is well-structured, easy to understand, and accurately simulates the game based on the input test cases.

Correctness: **True**
