This function simulates a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on the input test cases. It takes no parameters and returns no values. For each test case, it reads four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S), a permutation p of length n, and an array a of length n. It then simulates the game by iterating through the permutation and updating the scores of Bodya and Sasha. After each iteration, it prints the winner of the game ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on the final scores. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases (t).
