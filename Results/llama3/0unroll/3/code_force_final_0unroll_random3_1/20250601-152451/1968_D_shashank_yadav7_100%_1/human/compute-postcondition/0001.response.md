Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and after each execution, it will print either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on the values of bm and sm. The values of t, n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a will remain unchanged. The values of b, s, sp, bp, bm, and sm will be reset to their initial values at the beginning of each iteration.**
