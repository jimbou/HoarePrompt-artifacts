Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S) on the first line, a permutation p of length n on the second line, and an array a of length n on the third line. n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, P_B and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. p is a permutation of length n, and a is an array of positive integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the number of test cases, which is a positive integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been read and processed. The values of the other variables are not affected.
