Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of one line. The line contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains one line less than before, as the first line of the first test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin, each consisting of one line containing a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50).
