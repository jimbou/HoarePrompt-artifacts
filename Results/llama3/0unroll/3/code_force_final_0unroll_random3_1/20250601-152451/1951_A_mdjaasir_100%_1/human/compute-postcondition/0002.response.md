Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then determines whether the binary string can be rearranged to have no consecutive 1s and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case accordingly. The function does not return any value and only prints the results to the standard output.**
