You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases), then for each test case, first an integer (the length of the strip) and then a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: Output State: m is an integer, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer (the length of the strip) and then a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, ma is 0, mi is the position of the first 'B' in the string s, s is a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, c is the length of the string s, d is 0, l is an empty list
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has iterated over the string s in reverse order, and the variable d has been incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop has stopped when it encountered the first 'B' character from the end of the string. The variable ma has been updated to the position of this 'B' character from the start of the string. The other variables remain unchanged.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the first 'B' character from the end of the string and the position of the first 'B' character from the start of the string, plus 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the position of the first 'B' character from the end of the string and the position of the first 'B' character from the start of the string, plus 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
