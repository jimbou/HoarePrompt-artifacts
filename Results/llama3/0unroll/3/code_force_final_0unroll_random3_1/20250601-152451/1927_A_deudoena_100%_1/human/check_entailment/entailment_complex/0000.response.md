Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The program works by finding the positions of the first 'B' characters from the start and end of the string, and returning their difference plus 2.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the strip and the string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters. It then calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct. It iterates over the string from the start to find the position of the first 'B' character, and then iterates over the string from the end to find the position of the last 'B' character. The difference between these two positions plus 2 gives the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. The function `func_1()` is not defined anywhere in the program. The function that is defined is not given a name, and it is not clear how it is being called.

Correctness: **False**
