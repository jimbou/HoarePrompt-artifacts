Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains only one 'B' character. In this case, the program returns 2, but the correct answer should be 1. 

For example, if the input is:

1
B

The program will return 2, but the correct answer is 1. 

This is because the program adds 1 to the difference between the indices of the first and last 'B' characters, but in the case where there is only one 'B' character, this results in an incorrect answer. 

The correct program should handle this edge case and return the correct answer.
