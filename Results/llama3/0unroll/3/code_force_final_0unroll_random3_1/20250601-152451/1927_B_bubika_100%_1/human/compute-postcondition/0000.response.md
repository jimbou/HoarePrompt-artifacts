Output State: **`a` is a string of lowercase English letters, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

In this output state, a new variable `a` is introduced and assigned the string of lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The values of the other variables and the input in stdin remain unchanged.
