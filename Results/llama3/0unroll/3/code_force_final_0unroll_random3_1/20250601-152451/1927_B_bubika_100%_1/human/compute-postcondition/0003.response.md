Functionality: **Reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it generates a string of lowercase English letters based on the input integers and prints the resulting string to standard output. The function processes multiple test cases and produces multiple output strings, one for each test case.**
