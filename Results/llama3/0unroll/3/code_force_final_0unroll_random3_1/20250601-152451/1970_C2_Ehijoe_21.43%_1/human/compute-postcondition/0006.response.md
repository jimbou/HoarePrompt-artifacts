Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with n-1 key-value pairs, where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, start is an integer equal to the input value, n and t are still integers, edges is still an empty list, empty is still True, leaves is a deque containing all the leaf nodes in the tree, moves is a value returned by func_1(nodes, start).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `start`. The second line assigns the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)` to `moves`. No other variables are affected.
