Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

for i in range(t):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a list of lists of integers, start is an integer such that 0 <= start < len(nodes), and parent is either None or an integer such that 0 <= parent < len(nodes).
    if (len(nodes[start]) == 1 and nodes[start][0] == parent) :
        return [0]
        #The program returns a list containing a single element, which is the integer 0.
    #State: *nodes is a list of lists of integers, start is an integer such that 0 <= start < len(nodes), and parent is either None or an integer such that 0 <= parent < len(nodes). The length of the list at index start in nodes is not equal to 1 or the first element of the list at index start in nodes is not equal to parent.
    distances = []
    for node in nodes[start]:
        if node != parent:
            distances.extend([(1 + dist) for dist in func_1(nodes, node, start)])
        
    #State: Output State: The list `distances` contains all the distances from the node at index `start` in `nodes` to all other nodes in the graph, excluding the parent node of the node at index `start`. The distances are calculated by recursively calling `func_1` on each node in the list at index `start` in `nodes`, excluding the parent node, and adding 1 to each distance returned by `func_1`. The list `nodes`, the integer `start`, and the integer `parent` remain unchanged.
    return distances
    #The program returns a list of distances from the node at index `start` in `nodes` to all other nodes in the graph, excluding the parent node of the node at index `start`. The distances are calculated by recursively calling `func_1` on each node in the list at index `start` in `nodes`, excluding the parent node, and adding 1 to each distance returned by `func_1`. The list `nodes`, the integer `start`, and the integer `parent` remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates distances from a specified node to all other nodes in a graph, excluding the parent node. It takes a graph represented as a list of lists of integers, a start node index, and a parent node index as input. If the start node has only one neighbor, which is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single element, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates distances to all other nodes by calling another function, func_1, on each neighbor of the start node, excluding the parent node, and returns a list of these distances. The input graph and node indices remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, start is a node in the tree.
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: nodes is a dictionary with n-1 key-value pairs, where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, start is still a node in the tree, n and t are still integers, edges is still an empty list, empty is still True, stdin contains no input
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
        
    #State: Output State: nodes is a dictionary with n-1 key-value pairs, where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, start is still a node in the tree, n and t are still integers, edges is still an empty list, empty is still True, leaves is a deque containing all the leaf nodes in the tree.
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *nodes is a dictionary with n-1 key-value pairs, where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, start is an integer equal to the input value, n and t are still integers, edges is still an empty list, empty is still True, leaves is a deque containing all the leaf nodes in the tree, moves is a value returned by func_1(nodes, start). If at least one element in moves is odd, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in moves are even and 'Hermione' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given tree, represented by a dictionary of nodes and their adjacent nodes, and a starting node, results in a sequence of moves that contains at least one odd value or all even values. It prints 'Ron' if at least one move is odd, and 'Hermione' if all moves are even. The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on input values for the number of nodes, edges, and the starting node. It returns no value but prints the result based on the sequence of moves.
