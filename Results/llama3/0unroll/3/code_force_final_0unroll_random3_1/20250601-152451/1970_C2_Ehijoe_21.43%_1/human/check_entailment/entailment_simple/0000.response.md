Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly constructs the tree from the input edges.
2. It identifies the leaf nodes in the tree, which are the nodes with only one neighbor.
3. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the distances from a given node to all other nodes in the tree, excluding the parent node. This is done by recursively calling `func_1` on each neighbor of the node, excluding the parent node, and adding 1 to each distance returned by `func_1`.
4. The program correctly determines the winner of the game by checking if any of the distances from the starting node to the other nodes are odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the game's rules. The use of recursion in `func_1` is also correct, as it allows the program to efficiently calculate the distances from a node to all other nodes in the tree.

Correctness: **True**
