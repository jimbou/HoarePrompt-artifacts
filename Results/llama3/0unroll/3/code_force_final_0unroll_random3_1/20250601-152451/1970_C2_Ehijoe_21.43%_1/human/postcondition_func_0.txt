This function calculates distances from a specified node to all other nodes in a graph, excluding the parent node. It takes a graph represented as a list of lists of integers, a start node index, and a parent node index as input. If the start node has only one neighbor, which is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single element, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates distances to all other nodes by calling another function, func_1, on each neighbor of the start node, excluding the parent node, and returns a list of these distances. The input graph and node indices remain unchanged.
