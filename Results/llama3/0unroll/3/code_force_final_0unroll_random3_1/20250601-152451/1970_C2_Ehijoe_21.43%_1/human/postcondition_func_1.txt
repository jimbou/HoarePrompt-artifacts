This function determines whether a given tree, represented by a dictionary of nodes and their adjacent nodes, and a starting node, results in a sequence of moves that contains at least one odd value or all even values. It prints 'Ron' if at least one move is odd, and 'Hermione' if all moves are even. The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on input values for the number of nodes, edges, and the starting node. It returns no value but prints the result based on the sequence of moves.
