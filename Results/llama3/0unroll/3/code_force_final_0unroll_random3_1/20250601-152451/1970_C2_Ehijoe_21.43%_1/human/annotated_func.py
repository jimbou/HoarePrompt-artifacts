#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates distances from a specified node to all other nodes in a graph, excluding the parent node. It takes a graph represented as a list of lists of integers, a start node index, and a parent node index as input. If the start node has only one neighbor, which is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single element, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates distances to all other nodes by calling another function, func_1, on each neighbor of the start node, excluding the parent node, and returns a list of these distances. The input graph and node indices remain unchanged.

    #State: *nodes is a dictionary with n-1 key-value pairs, where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, start is an integer equal to the input value, n and t are still integers, edges is still an empty list, empty is still True, leaves is a deque containing all the leaf nodes in the tree, moves is a value returned by func_1(nodes, start). If at least one element in moves is odd, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in moves are even and 'Hermione' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given tree, represented by a dictionary of nodes and their adjacent nodes, and a starting node, results in a sequence of moves that contains at least one odd value or all even values. It prints 'Ron' if at least one move is odd, and 'Hermione' if all moves are even. The function takes no explicit parameters but relies on input values for the number of nodes, edges, and the starting node. It returns no value but prints the result based on the sequence of moves.
