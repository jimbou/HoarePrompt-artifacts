Reasoning: 

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates distances from a specified node to all other nodes in a graph, excluding the parent node. `func_2` determines whether a given tree, represented by a dictionary of nodes and their adjacent nodes, and a starting node, results in a sequence of moves that contains at least one odd value or all even values.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first constructs the tree from the input edges, then finds all leaf nodes. It then calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes using `func_1`. Finally, it checks if any of these distances are odd, and prints 'Ron' if so, or 'Hermione' if all distances are even.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the necessary steps to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
