Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem description states that the game is played on a tree of n nodes, and the goal is to determine who wins each round of the game. The program correctly represents the tree as a dictionary of nodes and their adjacent nodes.

2. The program uses a recursive function, `func_1`, to calculate distances from a specified node to all other nodes in the graph, excluding the parent node. This function is correct based on the provided execution summary.

3. The program uses `func_2` to determine whether a given tree and a starting node result in a sequence of moves that contains at least one odd value or all even values. This function is correct based on the provided execution summary.

4. The program correctly prints 'Ron' if at least one move is odd, and 'Hermione' if all moves are even, which aligns with the problem description.

5. The program assumes valid inputs as described in the problem, which is a reasonable assumption.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner of each round based on the tree structure and the starting node. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
