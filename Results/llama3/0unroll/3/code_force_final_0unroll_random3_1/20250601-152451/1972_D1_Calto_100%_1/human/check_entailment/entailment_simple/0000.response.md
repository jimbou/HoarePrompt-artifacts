Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided program uses two functions: `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and `func_2` to calculate the number of valid pairs.

In `func_2`, the program iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m`. For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` using the formulas `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. Then, it increments the count `cnt` by the ceiling of `x / y` plus 1 if `x` is a multiple of `y`.

The key insight here is that the condition `a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, we can write `a = k * b * gcd(a, b) - b`. Rearranging this equation, we get `a = (k * i - 1) * b`, where `i = gcd(a, b)`.

The program uses this insight to iterate over all possible values of `i` (which is the GCD of `a` and `b`) and calculates the corresponding values of `a` using the formula `a = (k * i - 1) * b`. The count `cnt` is incremented by the number of possible values of `a` for each `i`.

The program correctly calculates the number of valid pairs by iterating over all possible values of `i` and calculating the corresponding values of `a`. The use of the ceiling function and the increment by 1 when `x` is a multiple of `y` ensures that all possible values of `a` are counted correctly.

Correctness: **True**
