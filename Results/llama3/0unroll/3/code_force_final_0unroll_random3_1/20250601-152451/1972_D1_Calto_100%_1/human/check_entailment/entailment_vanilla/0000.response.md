Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

`func_2` calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. It iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m`, and for each `i`, it calculates the number of possible values of `a` that satisfy the conditions.

The key insight here is that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` if and only if `a` is a multiple of `i * i`, where `i` is a divisor of `b`. This is because `gcd(a, b)` is a divisor of `b`, and `b * gcd(a, b)` is a divisor of `a + b`.

The program uses this insight to count the number of possible values of `a` for each `i`. It calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, and then adds the number of multiples of `y` in the range `[x + 1, n]` to the count. This is done using the formula `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

The program returns the total count of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the mathematical insight described above. It correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions, and it does so efficiently using the Euclidean algorithm for gcd calculation and a clever counting strategy.

Note that the program assumes that the inputs `n` and `m` are positive integers, as stated in the problem description. If the inputs can be negative or non-integer, the program may not work correctly.
