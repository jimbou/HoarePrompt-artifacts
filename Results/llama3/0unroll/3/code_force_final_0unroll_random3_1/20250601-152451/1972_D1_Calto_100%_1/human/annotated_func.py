#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, modifying the input values in the process. It takes two positive integers as input and returns their GCD, leaving one of the input variables as the GCD and the other as 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: `cnt` is increased by a series of values starting with `n` and generally decreasing thereafter, with occasional increments by 1, while `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the value of cnt, which is a series of values starting with n and generally decreasing thereafter, with occasional increments by 1, while n and m remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a count value based on the input positive integers n and m. It iterates from 1 to m, performing calculations involving n and the current iteration number, and increments the count by a series of values starting with n, generally decreasing, with occasional increments by 1. The function does not modify the input values n and m.
