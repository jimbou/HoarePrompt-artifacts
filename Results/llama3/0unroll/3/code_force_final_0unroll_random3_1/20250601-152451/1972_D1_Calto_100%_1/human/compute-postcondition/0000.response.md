Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `cnt` is -1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as positive integers. The code introduces a new variable `cnt` and assigns it the value -1. The introduction of `cnt` does not affect the values of `n` and `m`, which remain positive integers.
