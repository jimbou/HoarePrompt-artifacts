Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the required conditions for the ordered pairs (a, b). The first function, `func_1`, is not used in the provided code, but it seems to be a helper function for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

The second function, `func_2`, is the main function that calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. It iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m` and calculates the corresponding value of `x` and `y`. The `math.ceil` function is used to round up the division result, and the `(x % y == 0)` condition is used to handle the case where `x` is exactly divisible by `y`.

The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description:

* `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m` are satisfied by the iteration over `i` from 1 to `m`.
* `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied by the calculation of `x` and `y`, which ensures that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` or `m` is 1.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
