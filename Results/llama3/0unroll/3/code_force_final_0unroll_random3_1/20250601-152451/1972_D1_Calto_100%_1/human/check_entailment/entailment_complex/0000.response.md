Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, which is used in the second condition.

Function 2 calculates a count value based on the input positive integers n and m. It iterates from 1 to m, performing calculations involving n and the current iteration number, and increments the count by a series of values starting with n, generally decreasing, with occasional increments by 1.

However, Function 2 does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem. The calculation `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not correctly represent the condition `a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)`. Moreover, the increment of `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs satisfying the conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
