To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the variables `n`, `m`, and `cnt`.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `m` (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates two values: `x` and `y`.

- `x = n - (i * i - i)`: This simplifies to `x = n - i^2 + i`.
- `y = i * i`: This is simply `y = i^2`.

Then, it updates `cnt` by adding two components:
- `math.ceil(x / y)`: This adds the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y` to `cnt`. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest whole number.
- `(x % y == 0)`: This adds 1 to `cnt` if `x` is perfectly divisible by `y` (i.e., the remainder of `x` divided by `y` is 0), otherwise, it adds 0.

Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers and `cnt` is initially -1, let's consider how `cnt` changes:

1. **For `i = 1`**: `x = n - 1 + 1 = n`, `y = 1`. So, `cnt` becomes `-1 + math.ceil(n / 1) + (n % 1 == 0) = -1 + n + 1 = n`.

2. **For `i > 1`**: The pattern becomes more complex due to the quadratic nature of `y` and the linear adjustment of `x`. However, we can observe that as `i` increases, `y` grows faster than `x` decreases, which means the ratio `x / y` tends to decrease. This implies that `math.ceil(x / y)` will eventually decrease as `i` increases, but the rate of decrease slows down due to the ceiling function.

3. **Perfect Divisibility Check**: The term `(x % y == 0)` will rarely contribute 1 to `cnt` because `x` and `y` are not typically going to have a common divisor that makes `x` perfectly divisible by `y`, especially as `i` increases and `x` decreases in a non-linear fashion.

Without specific values for `n` and `m`, it's challenging to provide an exact output state for `cnt`. However, we can say that `cnt` will increase by at least `n` in the first iteration and then by a series of values that generally decrease as `i` increases, with occasional increments by 1 when `x` is perfectly divisible by `y`.

Given the complexity and variability of the loop's effect on `cnt` based on the values of `n` and `m`, the output state cannot be simplified to a single, specific value without further information.

However, adhering to the requested format and acknowledging the lack of specificity:

Output State: **`cnt` is increased by a series of values starting with `n` and generally decreasing thereafter, with occasional increments by 1, while `n` and `m` remain unchanged.**
