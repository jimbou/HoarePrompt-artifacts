Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then modifies the list by adding the 1-based index to each element, removes duplicates while preserving the original order, and sorts the list in descending order. The function then inserts duplicates back into the list in the correct positions to maintain the sorted order. Finally, it prints the modified list in descending order, with duplicates inserted in the correct positions.**
