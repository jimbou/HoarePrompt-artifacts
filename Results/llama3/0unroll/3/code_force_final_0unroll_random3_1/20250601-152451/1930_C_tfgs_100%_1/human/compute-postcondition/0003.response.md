Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, counter is a dictionary where keys are integers between 2 and 10^9 + 3 * 10^5 inclusive and values are their respective counts in list a, cur is 0, a is a sorted list of unique integers between 2 and 10^9 + 3 * 10^5 inclusive in descending order, cnt is the count of duplicate integers in the original list a, ans is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

Here's a breakdown of how the code affects the variables:

- The `counter = Counter(a)` line creates a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in list `a` and the values are their respective counts. This does not modify `a` or `n`, but creates a new dictionary `counter`.

- The `cur = 0` line initializes a new variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect any other variables.

- The `a = list(set(a))` line removes duplicates from list `a` by converting it to a set (which automatically removes duplicates) and then back to a list. This modifies `a` to be a list of unique integers.

- The `a.sort(reverse=True)` line sorts the list `a` in descending order. This modifies `a` to be a sorted list of unique integers.

- The `cnt = n - len(a)` line calculates the count of duplicate integers in the original list `a` by subtracting the length of the new list `a` (which has no duplicates) from the original length `n`. This creates a new variable `cnt`.

- The `ans = []` line initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect any other variables.

- Stdin is not modified by the code, so it still contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
