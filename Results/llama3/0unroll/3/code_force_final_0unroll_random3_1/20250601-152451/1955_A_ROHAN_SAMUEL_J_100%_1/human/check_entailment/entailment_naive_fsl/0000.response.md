Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: when n is odd and when n is even. When n is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it buys n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b) and one yogurt at the regular price (a). When n is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it buys n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b).

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, including when n is 1, when a is equal to b, and when a is greater than b. It also correctly handles the case when n is even and 2 * a is less than b, in which case it buys all yogurts at the regular price.

Therefore, the program is correct and should print the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts for all possible inputs.
