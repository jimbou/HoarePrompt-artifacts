Calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation for each input line, based on the values of n, a, and b. The operation depends on whether n is odd or even, and the relationship between a and b. For odd n, the result is either a*n if 2*a < b, or n//2 * b + a otherwise. For even n, the result is a*n if 2*a < b, or n//2 * b otherwise. The function processes multiple input lines and prints the result for each line.
