Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts based on the promotion price and the regular price.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

* If n is odd, there are two possibilities:
	+ If 2*a < b, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt at the regular price a. So, the total cost is a*n.
	+ Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy n//2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price b and the remaining yogurt at the regular price a. So, the total cost is n//2 * b + a.
* If n is even, there are two possibilities:
	+ If 2*a < b, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt at the regular price a. So, the total cost is a*n.
	+ Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy n//2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price b. So, the total cost is n//2 * b.

The program correctly implements these cases using if-else statements and integer division (//) to calculate the total cost.

Correctness: **True**
