Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.

2. For each test case, it reads three integers: n (the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy), a (the price for one yogurt), and b (the price for two yogurts on promotion).

3. If n is odd (i.e., n % 2 is True), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost as a * n (buying all yogurts at the regular price). Otherwise, it prints the total cost as n // 2 * b + a (buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price).

4. If n is even (i.e., n % 2 is False), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost as a * n (buying all yogurts at the regular price). Otherwise, it prints the total cost as n // 2 * b (buying all yogurts at the promotion price).

The program correctly handles all possible scenarios based on the problem description. It considers both the regular price and the promotion price for buying yogurts and chooses the option that results in the minimum cost.

Correctness: **True**
