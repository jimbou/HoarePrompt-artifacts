Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles, and the regular price of one yogurt is a burles.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is odd or even, and the relationship between a and b. For odd n, it checks if 2*a is less than b, and if so, it calculates the cost as a*n. Otherwise, it calculates the cost as n//2 * b + a. For even n, it checks if 2*a is less than b, and if so, it calculates the cost as a*n. Otherwise, it calculates the cost as n//2 * b.

The program also correctly handles the case where n is 1, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. In this case, the cost is simply a.

The execution summary confirms that the program is working as expected, producing the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
