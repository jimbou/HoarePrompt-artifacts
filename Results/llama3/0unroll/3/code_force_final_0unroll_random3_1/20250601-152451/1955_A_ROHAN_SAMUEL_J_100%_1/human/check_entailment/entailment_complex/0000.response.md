Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts based on the promotion and regular prices.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the regular price `a`, and the promotion price `b`.
3. It then checks if `n` is odd or even using the modulo operator (`n % 2`).
4. If `n` is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`). If so, it calculates the total cost as `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as `n // 2 * b + a`.
5. If `n` is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`). If so, it calculates the total cost as `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost as `n // 2 * b`.
6. The program prints the calculated total cost for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
