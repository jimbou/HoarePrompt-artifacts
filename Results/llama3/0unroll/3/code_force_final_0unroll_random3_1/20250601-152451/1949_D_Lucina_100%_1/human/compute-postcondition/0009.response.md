Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, printing a new string `nx` for each iteration of the outer loop. The string `nx` is constructed by iterating over the characters in the `i-th` row of the 2D list `xx`. If a character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If the character is '?' and either the current row `i` or column `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` indices of the list `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`. The final state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop has executed and printed the constructed strings.
