Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it handles the assignment of 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transition videos. The program tries to balance the number of 'F's and 'S's by assigning 'F' to the first n//4 - 1 scenarios and 'S' to the rest. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will not have more than ceil(3n/4) consecutive videos of the same type.

For example, consider the case where n = 8 and the input is:

.?F????
?.??????
??.?????
???.????
????.????
?????.???
??????.??
???????.?

The program will assign 'F' to the first 1 scenario and 'S' to the rest, resulting in the following sequence:

.FSSSSSS
S.FSSSSS
SS.FSSSS
SSS.FSSS
SSSS.FSS
SSSSS.FS
SSSSSS.F
SSSSSSS.

However, this sequence has 6 consecutive 'S's, which is more than ceil(3*8/4) = 6. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
