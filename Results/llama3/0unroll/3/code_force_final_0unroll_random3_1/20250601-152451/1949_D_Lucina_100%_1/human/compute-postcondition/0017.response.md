Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the processed output. It takes n+1 inputs, where n is an integer between 2 and 24, and the next n inputs are strings of length n containing characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The function then identifies indices where 'F' and 'S' characters are present, and replaces '?' characters in the strings based on certain conditions. If the number of 'F' indices is greater than or equal to the number of 'S' indices, it replaces '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the presence of indices in the first n//4 - 1 indices of the 'F' list. Otherwise, it replaces '?' characters with 'S' or 'F' based on the presence of indices in the first n//4 - 1 indices of the 'S' list. Finally, it prints the processed strings.**
