stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (2 <= n <= 24), and the next n inputs are strings of length n. Each character in the strings is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The strings are symmetric, i.e., the j-th character of the i-th string is the same as the i-th character of the j-th string. At most floor(n/2) characters in the strings are 'F' or 'S'.
