Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly identifies the indices where 'F' and 'S' characters are present, and replaces '?' characters in the strings based on certain conditions. The conditions are designed to ensure that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type in a row.

The program first identifies the indices where 'F' and 'S' characters are present, and stores them in the sa and sb lists respectively. It then checks if the number of 'F' indices is greater than or equal to the number of 'S' indices. If it is, it replaces '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the presence of indices in the first n//4 - 1 indices of the sa list. Otherwise, it replaces '?' characters with 'S' or 'F' based on the presence of indices in the first n//4 - 1 indices of the sb list.

This approach ensures that the number of consecutive 'F' or 'S' characters in the output strings is limited to ceil(3n/4), which is the maximum allowed amount. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of 'F' indices is equal to the number of 'S' indices.

Correctness: **True**
