Postcondition: ***sa contains the indices of the list a where the value is greater than 0 and the corresponding value in list b is 0, sb contains the indices of the list b where the value is greater than 0 and the corresponding value in list a is 0, n remains unchanged, a remains unchanged, b remains unchanged, xx remains unchanged, and stdin remains unchanged. If the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb, the loop has executed all iterations, and the variable nx has been updated with a new string value in each iteration. The string nx now contains the concatenated characters from the 2D list xx at indices i and j-1, where i ranges from 1 to n and j ranges from 1 to n. If the character at xx[i][j-1] is '?', it is replaced with 'F' if either i or j is in the first n//4 - 1 indices of the list sa, and 'S' otherwise. The updated string nx is printed in each iteration. Otherwise, the loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive), and for each iteration i, it constructs a new string nx. nx is constructed by iterating over the characters in the i-th row of the 2D list xx. If the character is not '?', it is appended to nx. If the character is '?' and either the current row i or column j is in the first n//4 - 1 indices of sb, 'S' is appended to nx; otherwise, 'F' is appended. The constructed string nx is then printed.***
