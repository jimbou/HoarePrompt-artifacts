Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires the program to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal moves of both players. However, the program simply checks if the number 1 is present in the input list and prints 'Bob' if it is, and 'Alice' otherwise. This is not a correct solution to the problem.

The correct solution would involve finding the smallest non-empty pile and checking if its size is odd or even. If it's odd, Alice wins; if it's even, Bob wins. The program does not implement this logic correctly.

Correctness: **False**
