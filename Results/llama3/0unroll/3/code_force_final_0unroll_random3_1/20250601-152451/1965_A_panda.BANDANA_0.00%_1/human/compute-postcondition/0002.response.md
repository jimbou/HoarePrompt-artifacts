Output State: **The loop will execute t times, each time reading a test case from stdin. For each test case, it will print 'Bob' if the number 1 is present in the input list, and 'Alice' otherwise. The output will be a sequence of t lines, each containing either 'Bob' or 'Alice'. The value of t will be decremented by 1 after each iteration, and the input list l will be overwritten with the next test case. The set e and the variable m will also be updated accordingly.**
