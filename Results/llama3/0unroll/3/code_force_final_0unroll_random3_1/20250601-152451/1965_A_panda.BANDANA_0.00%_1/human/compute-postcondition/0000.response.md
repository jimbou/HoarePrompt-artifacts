Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` has been assigned an integer value between 1 and 2*10^5 (inclusive) from the input. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two inputs: an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
