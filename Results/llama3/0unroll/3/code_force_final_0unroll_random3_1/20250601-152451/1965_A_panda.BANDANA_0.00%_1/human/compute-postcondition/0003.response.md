Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then checks if the number 1 is present in the input list. If 1 is found, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. This process is repeated for each test case, resulting in a sequence of 'Bob' or 'Alice' outputs, one for each test case.**
