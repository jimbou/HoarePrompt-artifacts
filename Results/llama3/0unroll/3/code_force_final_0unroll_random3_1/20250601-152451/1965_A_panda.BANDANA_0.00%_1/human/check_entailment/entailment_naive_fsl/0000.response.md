Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The condition `if 1 in l` is not sufficient to determine the winner. The program should check if the smallest pile size is 1, not just if 1 is present in the list.

For example, if the input is `n = 2` and `l = [2, 3]`, the program will print "Alice", but the correct answer is "Bob". This is because Alice must choose `k=1` on her first turn, and then Bob can win on the next turn by choosing `k=2`.

The correct solution should find the smallest pile size and check if it is 1. If it is, then Bob wins. Otherwise, Alice wins.
