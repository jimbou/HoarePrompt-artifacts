Output State: The loop will execute t times, each time reading a test case from stdin. For each test case, it will read an integer n and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It will then check if 1 is in the list of integers. If 1 is in the list, it will print 'Bob', otherwise it will print 'Alice'. After all t iterations, the loop will finish executing, and the program will terminate. The value of t will be unchanged, and stdin will be empty.
