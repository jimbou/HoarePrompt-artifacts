Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input array is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program will output 4, but the correct output should be 3. This is because the program is counting the number of elements that are equal to the median, but it should be counting the number of elements that need to be increased to make the median greater than the current median.

In this case, since all elements are equal to the median, we only need to increase 3 elements to make the median greater than the current median. The program's logic is incorrect, and it does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
