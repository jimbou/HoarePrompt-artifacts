Output State: **t = 0, n = None, a = None, res = None, mdx = None, i = None.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is set to 0, and the variables `n`, `a`, `res`, `mdx`, and `i` are set to `None`, indicating that they are no longer in use.
