The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the length of the array) and then a list of integers (the array), the first input is accepted and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a list of integers (the array) and then the remaining test cases. The integers in the array are between 1 and 10^9.**
