Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9), where t is equal to `n_cases`**

In this output state, `n_cases` is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The remaining t lines in stdin, where t is equal to `n_cases`, each contain an integer n between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
