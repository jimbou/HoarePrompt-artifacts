Output State: The output state will contain t lines, each containing an integer. If the input integer n is 1, the output will be 1. If n is a power of 2 (i.e., n = 2^power), the output will be 2^power. Otherwise, the output will be 2^(power-1), where power is the largest integer such that 2^power is less than n.
