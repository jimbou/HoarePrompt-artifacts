This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of cases, and each subsequent integer represents a value for which the function calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given integer. If the given integer is a power of 2, the function prints the integer itself. The function processes all cases and outputs the results in the same order as the input.
