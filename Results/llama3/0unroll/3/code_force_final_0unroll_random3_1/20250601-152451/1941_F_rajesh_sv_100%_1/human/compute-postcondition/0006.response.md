The code prints the maximum value between the minimum of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A and the minimum of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A after subtracting the value of f from the left and right elements for all f in F, and the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A and the minimum of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A after subtracting the value of f from the left and right elements for all f in F, and next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A)**
