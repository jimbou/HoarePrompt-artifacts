Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in a list of distinct non-decreasing integers, and then updates this maximum difference by considering the minimum of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements after subtracting a value from the left and right elements for all values in a list of non-negative integers. The function returns the maximum of the updated maximum difference and the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in the original list.**
