Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n, m, and k are positive integers returned by func_4(), A is a list of n distinct non-decreasing integers returned by func_4(), D is a sorted list of distinct non-negative integers returned by func_4(), F is a list of non-negative integers returned by func_4(), max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, left is the value of A at index - 1, right is the value of A at index, and ans is the minimum of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A and the minimum of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A and the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A.
