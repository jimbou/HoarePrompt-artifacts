Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find the maximum and minimum values in a sequence through a series of queries. The program iterates over each test case, determines the maximum value by comparing each element with the current maximum, and then finds the minimum value by comparing each element with the current minimum. Finally, it prints the maximum and minimum values in the required format.

The program also adheres to the constraints specified in the problem description, such as the number of queries allowed (3n) and the format of the input and output.

Correctness: **True**
