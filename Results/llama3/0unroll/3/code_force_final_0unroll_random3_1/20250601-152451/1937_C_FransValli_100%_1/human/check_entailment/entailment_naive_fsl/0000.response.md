Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum and minimum values in the secret sequence `p` by asking queries in the form of "? a b c d" and receiving the results of comparisons between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.

The program first finds the maximum value `maxi` by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the minimum value `mini` among the elements that have the same maximum value as `maxi`. Finally, it prints the pair of indices `maxi` and `mini` that maximize the bitwise XOR operation `p_i ^ p_j`.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. It also handles the case where there are multiple pairs of indices that maximize the bitwise XOR operation by returning any one of them.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples I thought of work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
