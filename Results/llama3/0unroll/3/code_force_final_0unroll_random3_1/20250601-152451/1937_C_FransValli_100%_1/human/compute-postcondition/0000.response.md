Output State: **The output state is a series of print statements that output the maximum and minimum values of the sequence for each test case. The number of print statements is equal to the number of test cases. Each print statement is in the format '! maxi mini', where maxi is the maximum value and mini is the minimum value of the sequence. The stdin contains the same input as the initial state, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, followed by the number of elements in each sequence.**
