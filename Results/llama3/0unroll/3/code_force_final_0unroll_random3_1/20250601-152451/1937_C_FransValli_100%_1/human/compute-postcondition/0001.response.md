Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a sequence of integers. For each test case, it determines the maximum and minimum values in the sequence through a series of queries and prints the maximum and minimum values in the format '! maxi mini'. The function repeats this process for each test case, ultimately producing a series of print statements that output the maximum and minimum values for each sequence.**
