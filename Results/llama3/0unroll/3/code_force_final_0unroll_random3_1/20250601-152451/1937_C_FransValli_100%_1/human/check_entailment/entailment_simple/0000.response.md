Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the algorithm to find the maximum and minimum values in the secret sequence by asking queries to the jury.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first finds the maximum value in the sequence by comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done in the first for loop.

2. Then, it finds all elements that have the same maximum value as the maximum element found in step 1. This is done in the second for loop.

3. Next, it finds the minimum value among the elements found in step 2. This is done in the third for loop.

4. Finally, it prints the maximum and minimum values found.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted, and the program correctly handles the responses from the jury.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
