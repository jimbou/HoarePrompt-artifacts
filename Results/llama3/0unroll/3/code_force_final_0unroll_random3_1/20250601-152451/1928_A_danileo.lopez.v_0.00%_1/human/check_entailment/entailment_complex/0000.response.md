Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if either of the dimensions (a or b) is even, and if so, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that another rectangle cannot be formed.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if either dimension is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and therefore, another rectangle cannot be formed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where one or both dimensions are 1. It also correctly handles the case where the dimensions are equal (e.g., 2x2).

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will be accurate for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
