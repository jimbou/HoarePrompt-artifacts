Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It then determines whether the sum of these dimensions is even or odd and prints 'Yes' if the sum is even and 'No' if the sum is odd, one output per test case. The function consumes the contents of standard input and leaves the value of the test case counter unchanged.**
