Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) â€” the size of Bob's rectangle.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers a and b, which represent the size of Bob's rectangle. The values of a and b are still within the range of 1 to 10^9.
