Reasoning:

The program is correct. The problem statement requires determining whether a rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key insight is that if either dimension of the original rectangle is even, it can be cut into two equal halves, which can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle. This is because an even number can be divided by 2, resulting in two equal parts.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if either dimension (a or b) is even using the modulo operator (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`). If either condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that the rectangle can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading multiple test cases, determining the parity of the sum of the dimensions, and printing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
