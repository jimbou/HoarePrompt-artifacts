Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a and b are both odd and greater than 1. In this case, the program will print 'No', but it is actually possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then combining them.

For example, if a = 3 and b = 3, the program will print 'No', but it is actually possible to form a 1 x 9 rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two 1 x 3 rectangles and then combining them.

The correct solution should check if a and b are both odd and greater than 1, and if so, print 'Yes'. Otherwise, it should print 'No'.
