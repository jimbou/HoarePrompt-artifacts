Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list of integers such that for each index `i`, `results[i]` is the largest `y` such that `math.gcd(test_cases[i], y) + y` is maximized and `y` is less than `test_cases[i]`.
