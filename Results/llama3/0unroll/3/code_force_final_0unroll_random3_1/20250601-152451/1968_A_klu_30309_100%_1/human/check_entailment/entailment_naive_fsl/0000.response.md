Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs 3, but the correct output should be 5. The reason is that the program breaks the loop as soon as it finds a y that gives a greater sum, but it does not guarantee that this y is the one that gives the maximum possible sum. In this case, y = 5 gives a greater sum (gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11) than y = 3 (gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6).
