Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list of integers such that for each x in `test_cases`, the corresponding element in `results` is the largest y less than x such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximal.
