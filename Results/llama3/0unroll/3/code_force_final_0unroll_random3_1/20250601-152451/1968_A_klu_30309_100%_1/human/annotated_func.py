    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the largest y less than the corresponding x in test_cases such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximal, and the length of this list is equal to t, a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the largest y less than each x in a given list of test cases such that the sum of the greatest common divisor of x and y, and y itself, is maximal. It returns a list of these maximal y values, with the same length as the input list of test cases.
