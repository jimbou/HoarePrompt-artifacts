The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `arr` and the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`.

Since `ans` is the minimum of these two values, it represents the smallest number of consecutive equal elements found in the list `arr`.

Output: **the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the list arr**
