Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] would return 1, but the correct answer is 2, because removing any single element would still result in a beautiful array.

The issue is that the program only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements, but it does not consider the case when the elements are alternating. To fix this, the program should also check for the minimum count of alternating elements.
