Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array and checks if all adjacent elements are equal. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements that are not equal, the program finds the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array and prints this value.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of the `Decimal` class to represent the minimum number of consecutive equal elements is unnecessary, as the `int` type would suffice. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
