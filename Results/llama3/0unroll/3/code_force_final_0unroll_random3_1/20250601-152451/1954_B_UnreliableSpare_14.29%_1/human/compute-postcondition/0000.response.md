Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, flag is True**

Explanation:

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 3 * 10^5, this line reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.

The second line reads `n` integers from stdin and assigns them to `arr`. Since each integer is between 1 and `n`, this line consumes `n` integers from stdin.

The third line assigns `True` to `flag`. This line does not affect any other variables.

After executing the entire code block, `n` has been assigned a value between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` has been assigned a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`, and `flag` has been set to `True`. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 1.
