Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1 because it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. 

If the elements are not all equal, it then finds the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array. This is because removing these consecutive equal elements would make the array not beautiful. 

The program uses a flag to check if all elements are equal, and it uses a variable `ans` to keep track of the minimum number of consecutive equal elements. 

The program also handles the edge case where the array has only one element, in which case it prints -1. 

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
