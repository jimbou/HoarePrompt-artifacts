Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. If the elements are not all the same, it finds the minimum count of consecutive equal elements and prints that as the answer.

Correctness: **True**
