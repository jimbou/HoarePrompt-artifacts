Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful.

If the elements are not all the same, the program then iterates through the array to find the minimum count of consecutive elements that have the same value as the first element. This is done by maintaining a count of consecutive elements with the same value and updating the minimum count whenever a different element is encountered.

The program uses the `Decimal` class from the `decimal` module to represent the minimum count as a decimal number, which is initialized to infinity. This is done to ensure that the minimum count is correctly updated even if the count of consecutive elements is zero.

Finally, the program prints the minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
