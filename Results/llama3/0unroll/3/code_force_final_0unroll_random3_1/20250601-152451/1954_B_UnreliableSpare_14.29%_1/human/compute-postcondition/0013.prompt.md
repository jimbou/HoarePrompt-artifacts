You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) that form a beautiful array.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: ans is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in arr, val is the last element of arr, cnt is the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of arr, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the list arr
    #State: `ans` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `arr` and the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, `val` is the last element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and n. If all adjacent elements in `arr` are equal, -1 is printed. Otherwise, there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, and the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `arr` and the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr` which is `ans` is being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `ans` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `arr` and the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, `val` is the last element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and n, `flag` is True, indicating that all adjacent elements in `arr` are equal, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and -1 is printed

Case_2: `ans` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `arr` and the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, `val` is the last element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and n, `flag` is False, and there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, and the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `arr` and the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr` which is `ans` is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
