The code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `ans` is the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `arr` and `cnt` is the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, the updated value of `ans` will be the minimum of the current minimum and the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of the previous minimum number of consecutive equal elements in `arr` and the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, `val` is the last element of `arr`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive equal elements ending at the last element of `arr`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n integers between 1 and n, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is True, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
