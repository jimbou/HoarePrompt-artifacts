Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between adjacent elements. The given program attempts to solve this problem by sorting the array in ascending order, then rearranging the elements in a way that maximizes the beauty.

However, the program does not correctly implement this approach. The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order, but then it creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements from the original array. This does not necessarily produce the maximum beauty, as it does not consider the differences between adjacent elements.

Moreover, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between adjacent elements in the reversed array, which is not the correct approach. The beauty should be calculated by summing the differences between adjacent elements in the original array, not the reversed array.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
