Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array. It then calls the function `func_1` to calculate the maximum beauty of the array.

The function `func_1` first sorts the array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This is done to maximize the differences between adjacent elements in the new array.

Finally, the function calculates the maximum beauty of the array by summing up the absolute differences between adjacent elements in the new array.

The program then prints the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements to maximize the differences between adjacent elements.

Correctness: **True**
