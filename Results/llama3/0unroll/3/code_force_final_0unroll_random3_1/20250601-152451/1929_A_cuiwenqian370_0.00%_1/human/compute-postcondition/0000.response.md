Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, right is n - 1**

The code snippet sorts the list `arr` in ascending order, creates an empty list `new_arr`, and initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the list `arr`, respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
