Output State: **new_arr contains the elements of arr in reverse order, left is n, right is -1, and n and arr remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that the new_arr list now contains the elements of the original arr list, but in reverse order. The left and right pointers have moved past each other, with left now pointing to the index after the last element of arr (n) and right pointing to the index before the first element of arr (-1). The values of n and arr remain unchanged.
