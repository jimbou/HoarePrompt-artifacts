#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and arr is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i.
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])

    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between adjacent elements in the reversed array `arr`, `left` is `n`, `right` is -1, `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, and `new_arr` contains the elements of `arr` in reverse order.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between adjacent elements in the reversed array `arr`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr` as input, reverses the order of the elements in `arr`, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between adjacent elements in the reversed array. The function does not modify the original array `arr` or the value of `n`.
