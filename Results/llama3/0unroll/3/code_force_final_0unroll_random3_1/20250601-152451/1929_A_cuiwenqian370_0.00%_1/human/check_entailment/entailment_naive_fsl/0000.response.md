Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It first sorts the input array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements from the sorted array. This is done to maximize the beauty of the array, which is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The program then calculates the beauty of the new array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is done correctly using a simple loop.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the input array has only two elements, where the beauty is simply the absolute difference between the two elements.

The program also handles the case where the input array has duplicate elements, where the beauty is still calculated correctly.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
