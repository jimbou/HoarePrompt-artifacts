Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips on a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases, the number of cells in each test case, and the state of each cell (0 for free or 1 for chip).

The program uses the `find` method to locate the first and last occurrences of '1' in the input string, which represents the chips. It then extracts the substring between these two indices using slicing (`arr[x:n - y]`). Finally, it counts the number of '0's in this substring using the `count` method and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately identifies the first and last chips, extracts the relevant substring, and counts the number of free cells between them. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Correctness: **True**
