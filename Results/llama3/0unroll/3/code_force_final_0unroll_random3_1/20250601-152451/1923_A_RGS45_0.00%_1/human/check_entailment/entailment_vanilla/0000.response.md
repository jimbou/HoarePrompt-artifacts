Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of operations to move the chips in a ribbon such that they form a single block without any free cells between them.

2. The given program reads the number of test cases, the number of cells in the ribbon, and the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for chip).

3. It then finds the index of the first chip from the left (x) and the index of the first chip from the right (y).

4. It creates a substring (z) from the original string (arr) starting from the index of the first chip from the left (x) to the index of the first chip from the right (y) from the end of the string.

5. Finally, it counts the number of '0's in the substring (z) and prints the result.

6. The program assumes that the input is valid as described in the problem description.

7. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Correctness: **True**
