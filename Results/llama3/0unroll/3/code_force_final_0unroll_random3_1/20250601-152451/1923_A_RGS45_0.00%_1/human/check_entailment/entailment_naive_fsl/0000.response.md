Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first finds the index of the first '1' (chip) in the array using the `find` method. This gives the starting index of the block of chips.
2. It then finds the index of the first '1' (chip) from the end of the array using the `find` method on the reversed array. This gives the ending index of the block of chips.
3. It then extracts the substring of the array between the starting and ending indices of the block of chips.
4. Finally, it counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the extracted substring and prints the result.

This logic is correct because it correctly identifies the block of chips and counts the number of free cells within that block. The minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them is equal to the number of free cells within the block.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including cases where the block of chips is at the beginning or end of the array, or where there are multiple blocks of chips. It also handles cases where there are no free cells between the chips, in which case the output is 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and the Correctness is **True**.
