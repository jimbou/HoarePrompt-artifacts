The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an array of binary digits. It then identifies the first and last occurrence of the digit '1' in each array, extracts the subarray between these two occurrences, counts the number of zeros in this subarray, and prints this count to the console. The function processes all test cases and consumes the entire input buffer, leaving no remaining input or state after execution.
