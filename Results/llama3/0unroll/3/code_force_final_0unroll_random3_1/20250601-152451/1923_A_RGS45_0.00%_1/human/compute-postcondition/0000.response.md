The code `t = int(input(''))` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1.**
