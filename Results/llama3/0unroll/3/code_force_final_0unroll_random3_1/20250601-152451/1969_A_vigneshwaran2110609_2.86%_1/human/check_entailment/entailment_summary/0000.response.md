Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at the party.

The program iterates over each test case, and for each case, it checks if there exists a pair of integers (p_i, p_j) such that p_i = p_j. This is because if such a pair exists, Monocarp can send invitations to both p_i and p_j, and both will come to the party, resulting in a minimum of 2 invitations.

If no such pair is found, the program prints 3, which is the minimum number of invitations required to have at least 2 friends at the party in the worst-case scenario.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
