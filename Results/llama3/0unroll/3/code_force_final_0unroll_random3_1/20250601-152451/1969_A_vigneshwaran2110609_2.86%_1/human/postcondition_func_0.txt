This function reads input from stdin, processes test cases, and prints the result for each case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function iterates over the test cases, and for each case, it checks if there exists a pair of integers (p_i, p_j) such that p_i = p_j. If such a pair is found, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not modify the input values and does not retain any state after execution.
