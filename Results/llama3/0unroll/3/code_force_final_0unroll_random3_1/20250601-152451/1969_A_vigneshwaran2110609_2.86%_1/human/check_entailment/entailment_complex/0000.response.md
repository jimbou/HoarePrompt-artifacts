Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program iterates over each test case, and for each case, it checks if there exists a pair of integers (p_i, p_j) such that p_i = p_j. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp can send invitations to these two friends and they will both come to the party. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to ensure that at least two of them come to the party.

The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description, including the fact that all p_i are distinct and p_i != i. The program also correctly handles the case where n = 2, where Monocarp can send invitations to both friends and they will both come to the party.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
