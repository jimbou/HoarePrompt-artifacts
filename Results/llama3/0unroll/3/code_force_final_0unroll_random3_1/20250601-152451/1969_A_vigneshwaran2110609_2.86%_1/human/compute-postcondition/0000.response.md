Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= `p_i` <= `n`; `p_i` != `i`) and `t-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= `p_i` <= `n`; `p_i` != `i`) and `t-1` test cases.
