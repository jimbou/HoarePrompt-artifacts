Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at his party. The program iterates through each test case, where it checks if there exists a pair of integers (p_i, p_j) such that p_i = p_j. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp can send invitations to these two friends and have them both attend the party. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to have at least 2 of them attend the party.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately identifies the condition for sending invitations to only 2 friends (i.e., finding a pair of integers (p_i, p_j) such that p_i = p_j). If this condition is not met, it correctly concludes that at least 3 invitations are needed.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable `flag` is introduced but not used anywhere in the program. This variable is not necessary and can be removed without affecting the program's functionality.

Correctness: **True**
