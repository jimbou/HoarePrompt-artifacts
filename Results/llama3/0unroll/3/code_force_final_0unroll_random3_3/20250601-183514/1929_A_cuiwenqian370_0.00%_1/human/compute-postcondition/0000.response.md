Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all i, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, right is n - 1**

The code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order, and assigns the sorted list back to `arr`. The list `new_arr` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `left` and `right` are assigned the values 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
