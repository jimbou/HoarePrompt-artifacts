Output State: **new_arr is a list of n integers such that new_arr[i] = arr[n-i-1] if i is even and new_arr[i] = arr[i//2] if i is odd, left is n, right is -1**.

In natural language, the output state is that the new_arr list is a rearranged version of the original arr list, where the elements are alternately taken from the end and the beginning of the original list. The left variable has reached the end of the list (n), and the right variable has reached the beginning of the list (-1).
