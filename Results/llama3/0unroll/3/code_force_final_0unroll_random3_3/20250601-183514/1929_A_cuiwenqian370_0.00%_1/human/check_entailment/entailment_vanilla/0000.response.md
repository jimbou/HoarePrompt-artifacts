Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by first sorting the input array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements from the sorted array. Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

However, there is a flaw in the program's approach. The beauty of the array is not necessarily maximized by alternating between the smallest and largest elements. A more optimal approach would be to simply sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The correct solution would be to sort the array and then calculate the beauty as follows:

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    return max_beauty

This solution correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
