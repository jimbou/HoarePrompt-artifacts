Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.

The program first sorts the input array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements of the sorted array. This is done to maximize the beauty of the array, as the largest differences between adjacent elements will be obtained by placing the largest element next to the smallest element, the second largest element next to the second smallest element, and so on.

After creating the new array, the program calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the absolute differences between adjacent elements. This is done using a simple loop that iterates over the elements of the new array.

The program returns the calculated beauty as the result.

Based on the provided execution states, it can be seen that the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The sorting of the input array, the creation of the new array, and the calculation of the beauty are all done correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
