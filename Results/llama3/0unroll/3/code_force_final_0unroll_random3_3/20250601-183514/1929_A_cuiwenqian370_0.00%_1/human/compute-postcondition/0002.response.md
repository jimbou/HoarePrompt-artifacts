Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of n integers such that `new_arr[i] = arr[n-i-1]` if i is even and `new_arr[i] = arr[i//2]` if i is odd, `left` is n, `right` is -1, `max_beauty` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `new_arr`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `max_beauty` which is initialized to 0.
