Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program first sorts the array in ascending order, then creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

*   When all elements are equal, the beauty is 0.
*   When there are only two elements, the beauty is the absolute difference between them.
*   When there are more than two elements, the program correctly alternates between the largest and smallest remaining elements to maximize the beauty.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input array has only two elements or when all elements are equal.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
