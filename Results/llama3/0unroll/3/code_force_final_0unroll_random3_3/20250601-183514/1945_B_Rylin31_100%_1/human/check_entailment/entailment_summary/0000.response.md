Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by adding the number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation and adding 2.

The program uses the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` to calculate the result. This expression is based on the fact that the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation is the number of times the firework is visible in the sky (`m`) divided by the frequency of launching for that installation (`a` or `b`). The `//` operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and returns the quotient.

The program also adds 2 to the result, which is likely to account for the fact that the first firework from each installation is visible for `m + 1` minutes, and the last firework from each installation is visible for `m + 1` minutes as well. This means that there are two additional fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

The execution summary shows that the program executes this process correctly for each test case, producing the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
