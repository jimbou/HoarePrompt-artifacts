Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins based on the given conditions.

The program first checks if the maximum number of consecutive losses (x) is less than the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win (k-1). If this condition is true, Sasha can guarantee winning by placing a bet of 1 coin if he has not lost the previous bet, and a bet of 2 coins if he has lost the previous bet.

If x is equal to k-1, Sasha needs to have at least x+3 coins to guarantee winning. This is because he needs to have enough coins to place a bet of 1 coin if he has not lost the previous bet, a bet of 2 coins if he has lost the previous bet, and a bet of 3 coins if he has lost the previous two bets.

If x is greater than k-1, Sasha needs to have at least z coins to guarantee winning, where z is calculated by summing up the minimum number of coins needed to place a bet in each of the x+1 possible outcomes (win or lose).

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee winning in each case and prints "YES" if Sasha has enough coins and "NO" otherwise.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
