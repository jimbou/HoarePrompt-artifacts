The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains three integers, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers.**
