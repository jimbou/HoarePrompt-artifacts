The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) on the first line, followed by t lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78). After accepting the integer t, the stdin now contains t lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78). The value of `cases` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 100).
Output State: **`cases` is an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), stdin contains t lines each containing an integer n (3 <= n <= 78)**
