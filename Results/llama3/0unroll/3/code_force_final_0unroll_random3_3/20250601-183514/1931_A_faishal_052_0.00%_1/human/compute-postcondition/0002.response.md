Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and generates three lowercase letters based on the value of n. If n is between 3 and 26, the letters are the first n letters of the alphabet. If n is between 27 and 51, the letters are 'a' followed by the first n-26 letters of the alphabet. If n is between 52 and 78, the letters are 'a' followed by 'z' followed by the first n-52 letters of the alphabet. The function prints the generated letters in alphabetical order for each test case.**
