Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The integer represents the sum of the positions of all the characters in the alphabet.

The program works by first determining the last two letters of the word. If the input integer is less than or equal to 26, it means that the last two letters are the first 'lex' letters of the alphabet. If the input integer is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), it means that the last letter is 'z' and the second last letter is the 'lex-26'th letter of the alphabet. If the input integer is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), it means that the last two letters are 'z' and the 'lex-52'th letter of the alphabet.

After determining the last two letters, the program appends the remaining value of 'lex' to the array. The array is then sorted to ensure that the letters are in alphabetical order.

Finally, the program prints the three letters by converting the values in the array to their corresponding lowercase letters using the ASCII value of 'a' (which is 97).

Correctness: **True**
