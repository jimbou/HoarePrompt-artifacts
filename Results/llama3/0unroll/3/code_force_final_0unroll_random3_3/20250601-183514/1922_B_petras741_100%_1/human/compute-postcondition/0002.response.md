Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three distinct integers from the input list for each test case. If a test case has less than three integers, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value or modify any external state, but rather consumes all input test cases from standard input.**
