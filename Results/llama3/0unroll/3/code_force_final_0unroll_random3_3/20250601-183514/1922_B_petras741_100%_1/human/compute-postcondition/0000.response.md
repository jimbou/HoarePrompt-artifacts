Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n.**

The first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable t. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second line initializes an empty list called buffer. No other variables are affected.
