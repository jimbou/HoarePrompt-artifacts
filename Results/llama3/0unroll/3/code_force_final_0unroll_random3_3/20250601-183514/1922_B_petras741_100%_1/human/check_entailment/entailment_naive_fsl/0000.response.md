Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. It first counts the frequency of each stick length, then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same length, and finally adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from the same length and 1 stick from a different length.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If there are less than 3 sticks, it prints 0.
* If all sticks have the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same length.
* If there are multiple stick lengths, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same length and adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from the same length and 1 stick from a different length.

The program uses the formula for combinations to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same length, and the formula for permutations to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from the same length and 1 stick from a different length.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
