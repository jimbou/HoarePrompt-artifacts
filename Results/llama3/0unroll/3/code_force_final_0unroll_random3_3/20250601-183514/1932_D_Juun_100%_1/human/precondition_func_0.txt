stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character (one of "CDHS"), and 2n two-character strings (the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS"). All 2n two-character strings are different.
