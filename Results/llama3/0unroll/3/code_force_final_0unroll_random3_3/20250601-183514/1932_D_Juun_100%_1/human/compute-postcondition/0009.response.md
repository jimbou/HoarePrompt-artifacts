Functionality: **This function processes a set of input cards and generates a sequence of card combinations based on a given trump suit. It takes no explicit parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting a specific format. The function first parses the input, separating cards into trumps and non-trumps. It then attempts to pair non-trump cards of the same suit in ascending order, using a trump card if necessary. If pairing is impossible, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and terminates. Otherwise, it prints the paired card combinations, followed by any remaining trump card pairs. The function modifies the input state by consuming stdin and produces output to stdout, leaving the input variables in an empty or initialized state.**
