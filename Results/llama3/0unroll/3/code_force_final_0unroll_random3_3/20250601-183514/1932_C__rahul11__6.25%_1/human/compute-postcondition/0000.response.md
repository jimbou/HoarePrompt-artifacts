Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), then a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.**

The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value 1000000006, which is a large prime number often used in competitive programming for modulo operations. The values of the other variables and the contents of stdin are not affected by this code. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of the `MOD` constant.
