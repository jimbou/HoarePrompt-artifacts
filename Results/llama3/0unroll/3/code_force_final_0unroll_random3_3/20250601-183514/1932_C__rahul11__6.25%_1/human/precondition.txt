The input contains an integer t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m, the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters. 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4, 1 <= a_i <= 10^4.
