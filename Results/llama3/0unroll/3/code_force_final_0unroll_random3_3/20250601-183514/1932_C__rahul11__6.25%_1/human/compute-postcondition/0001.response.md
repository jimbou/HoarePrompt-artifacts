Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer is the result of the modular exponentiation of the product of the elements in the array `arr` with the modulus `m` and `MOD`, after each iteration of the loop. The list is printed to the console. The values of `MOD`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
