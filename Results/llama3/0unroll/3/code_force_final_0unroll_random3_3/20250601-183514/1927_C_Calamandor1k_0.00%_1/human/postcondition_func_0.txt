This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) followed by two lists of integers (a and b). It then checks if the number of elements in both lists that are less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to half of k. If this condition is met for both lists, it prints 'YES' to the console; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case, printing a 'YES' or 'NO' for each one.
