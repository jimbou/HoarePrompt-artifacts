#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each corresponding to a test case. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed will be equal to the value of `t`. The output will indicate whether the conditions `count_a >= d` and `count_b >= d` are met for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) followed by two lists of integers (a and b). It then checks if the number of elements in both lists that are less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to half of k. If this condition is met for both lists, it prints 'YES' to the console; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case, printing a 'YES' or 'NO' for each one.
