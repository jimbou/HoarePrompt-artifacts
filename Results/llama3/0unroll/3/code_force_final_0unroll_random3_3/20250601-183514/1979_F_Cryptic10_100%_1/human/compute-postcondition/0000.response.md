Output State: **`q` is a function that prints '? %d' % d and returns a list of integers from the input, stdin contains one input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the function `q` is defined as a lambda function that takes an integer `d` as input, prints '? %d' % d with a flush, and then returns a list of integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The stdin still contains one input: an integer (2 <= n <= 10^5), which is the input for the next test case.
