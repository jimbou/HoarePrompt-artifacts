This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n. For each test case, it generates a specific permutation of the numbers from 1 to n and prints it to standard output, followed by the same permutation in reverse order. The function also prints intermediate queries to standard output and reads responses from standard input. The function repeats this process for each test case.
