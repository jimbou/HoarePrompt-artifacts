The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n integers. n is a positive integer and each of the n integers is a positive integer. The first input is accepted and converted to an integer and assigned to `t`. So, `t` is a positive integer and stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n integers. n is a positive integer and each of the n integers is a positive integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n integers. n is a positive integer and each of the n integers is a positive integer.**
