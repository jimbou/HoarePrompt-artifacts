Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The current implementation only checks if 1 is in the list of pile sizes, and if so, it prints 'Bob'. However, this is not sufficient to determine the winner.

A counterexample is when the list of pile sizes is [2, 2, 2]. In this case, the program will print 'Alice', but the correct answer is 'Bob'. This is because Alice can only remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving Bob with the opportunity to remove the remaining stones and win.

To correctly determine the winner, the program needs to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the pile sizes and check if it is 1. If the GCD is 1, then Alice can always make a move and win. If the GCD is greater than 1, then Bob can always make a move and win.
