Output State: **The output state is a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed to the console, with the number of lines equal to the initial value of t. Each line is determined by whether the number 1 is present in the corresponding list of integers. If 1 is present, 'Bob' is printed; otherwise, 'Alice' is printed. The value of t is not changed, and the input test cases are consumed.**
