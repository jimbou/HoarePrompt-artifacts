This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by n positive integers. It then checks if the number 1 is present in each list of integers and prints 'Bob' if 1 is present, or 'Alice' if 1 is not present. The function prints a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' lines to the console, with the number of lines equal to the initial number of test cases.
