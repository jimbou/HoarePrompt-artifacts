Output State: **`a` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `a` is now assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and the rest of the initial state remains the same, with stdin still containing multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines with a single integer n and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, respectively.
