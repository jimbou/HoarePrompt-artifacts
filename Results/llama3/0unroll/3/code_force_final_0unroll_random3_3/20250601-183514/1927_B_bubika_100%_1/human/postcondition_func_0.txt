This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then generates a string by mapping each integer to a character in the alphabet (with 'a' corresponding to 0, 'b' to 1, and so on), incrementing the corresponding index in the alphabet for each occurrence. The function prints the resulting string for each test case.
