Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same number. If it finds a number that is different from the previous one, it updates the minimum count and resets the counter. If the minimum count remains infinity at the end, it means that all elements in the array are the same, and it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The variable `i` is incremented twice in the while loop, which causes the program to skip every other element in the array. This means that the program will not correctly identify the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same number.

Correctness: **False**
