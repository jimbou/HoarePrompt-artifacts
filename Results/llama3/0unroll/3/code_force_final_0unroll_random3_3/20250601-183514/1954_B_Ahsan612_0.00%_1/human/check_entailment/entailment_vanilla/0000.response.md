Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

3. It initializes variables `same` to 1 (to count the number of consecutive occurrences of the same number) and `num` to the first element of the array.

4. It also initializes `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the same number.

5. The program then iterates over the array, incrementing `same` whenever it encounters the same number as the previous one. When it encounters a different number, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and moves to the next number.

6. After iterating over the entire array, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.

7. If `minn` is still infinity, it means that all elements in the array are the same, and it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements. In this case, it prints -1.

8. Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
