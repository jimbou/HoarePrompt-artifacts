Reasoning:

The given program is designed to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, counting the consecutive occurrences of the same number. It keeps track of the minimum count seen so far. If the minimum count is infinity, it means that the array consists of identical numbers, and it is impossible to make it stop being beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. It correctly identifies when the array consists of identical numbers and outputs -1 in such cases. It also correctly finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same number in the array.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable "same" is not necessary, and the program can be simplified by removing it. The variable "minn" can be initialized to infinity, and the program can directly update "minn" whenever it finds a smaller count of consecutive occurrences of the same number.

Correctness: **True**
