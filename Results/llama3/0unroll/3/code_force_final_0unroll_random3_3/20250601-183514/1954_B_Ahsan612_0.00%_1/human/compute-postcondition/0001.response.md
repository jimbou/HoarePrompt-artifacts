Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It then analyzes each list to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same number. If such a number exists, it prints the minimum count; otherwise, it prints -1. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the result for each case on a separate line.**
