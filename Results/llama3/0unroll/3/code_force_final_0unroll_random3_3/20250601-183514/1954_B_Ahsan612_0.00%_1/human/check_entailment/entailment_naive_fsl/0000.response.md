Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. In this case, the program will return the minimum length of the segments of the same element, but it does not check if removing this minimum length segment will make the array non-beautiful.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2], the program will return 1, but removing one element will not make the array non-beautiful. The correct output should be -1 in this case.

The program needs to be modified to check if removing the minimum length segment will make the array non-beautiful.
