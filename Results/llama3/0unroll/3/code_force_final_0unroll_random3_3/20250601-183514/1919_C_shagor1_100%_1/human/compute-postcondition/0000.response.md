Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). No variables have been assigned any values.**

The code `pass` does not have any impact on the program, so the output state remains the same as the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. No variables have been assigned any values.
