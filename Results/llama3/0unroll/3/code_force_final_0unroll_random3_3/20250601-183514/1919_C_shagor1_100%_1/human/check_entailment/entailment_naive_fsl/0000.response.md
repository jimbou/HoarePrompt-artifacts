Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences. The idea is to maintain two variables, `la` and `lb`, to keep track of the last element in each subsequence. If the current element is less than or equal to `la`, it is added to the first subsequence. If it is less than or equal to `lb`, it is added to the second subsequence. If it is greater than both `la` and `lb`, it is added to the first subsequence, and `la` is updated to `lb`, and `lb` is updated to the current element. This process ensures that the penalty is minimized.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the array has only one element or all elements are the same. The use of `(*inp,)` to unpack the input array is also correct.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
