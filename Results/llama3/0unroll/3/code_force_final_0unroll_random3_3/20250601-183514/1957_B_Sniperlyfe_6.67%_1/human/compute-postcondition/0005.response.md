Functionality: **This function generates a list of 'n' integers where each integer is the maximum possible value that can be represented by 'k' bits, and the last integer in the list is the sum of the maximum possible value and the remaining value of 'k'. The function takes two parameters, 'n' and 'k', and returns a list of 'n' integers. The function modifies the value of 'k' during its execution, but the original value of 'n' remains unchanged.**
