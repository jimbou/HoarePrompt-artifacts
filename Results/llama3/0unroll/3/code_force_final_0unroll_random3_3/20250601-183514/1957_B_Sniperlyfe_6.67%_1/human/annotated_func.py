#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < 1 << k.bit_length() - 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is equal to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of 'n' integers where the last integer is equal to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k and the rest of the integers are equal to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of 'n' integers where each integer is the maximum possible value that can be represented by 'k' bits, and the last integer in the list is the sum of the maximum possible value and the remaining value of 'k'. The function takes two parameters, 'n' and 'k', and returns a list of 'n' integers. The function modifies the value of 'k' during its execution, but the original value of 'n' remains unchanged.
