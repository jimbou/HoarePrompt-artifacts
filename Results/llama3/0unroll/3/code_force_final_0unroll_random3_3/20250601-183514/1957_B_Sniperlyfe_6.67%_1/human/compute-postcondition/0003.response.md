Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < 1 << k.bit_length() - 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the last integer is equal to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k and the rest of the integers are equal to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is still an integer less than 1 shifted left by the bit length of `k` minus 1. The list `nums` still has `n` integers, but the last integer is now the sum of the original value (1 shifted left by the bit length of `k` minus 1, minus 1) and `k`, while the rest of the integers remain the same as before.
