Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` zeros.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code created a new list `nums` with `n` elements, all initialized to zero.
