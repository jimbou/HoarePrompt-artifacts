Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when n is greater than k. In this case, the program will try to assign a value to each number in the sequence that is greater than k, which is not possible. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program will try to assign 1 to each number in the sequence, but this will exceed the sum k.

A correct solution would be to assign the maximum possible value to the first number in the sequence, and then distribute the remaining sum among the remaining numbers. Here is an example of a correct solution:

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        nums[i] = min(k, 1)
        k -= nums[i]
    return nums

This solution first assigns the maximum possible value to the first number in the sequence, and then distributes the remaining sum among the remaining numbers. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is equal to k, and that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the sequence is maximized.
