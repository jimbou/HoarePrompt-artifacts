Output: **`b` is a list of n+1 positive integers where each element at index i (1 <= i <= n) is the sum of the number of occurrences of 1 and twice the number of occurrences of any other number in the subarray a[1..i], `a` is a list of n+1 positive integers where each element at index i (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list a up to index i, and the cumulative sums of the elements in the original list a up to each index i are being printed**
