Output State: **`b` is a list of n+1 positive integers where each element at index i (1 <= i <= n) is the sum of the number of occurrences of 1 and twice the number of occurrences of any other number in the subarray a[1..i], `a` is a list of n+1 positive integers where each element at index i (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list a up to index i.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to be the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list `a` up to each index `i`. The value of `b` remains the same as in the initial state, as the code does not modify it.
