Precondition: **stdin contains multiple inputs: the first line contains an integer (number of test cases), then for each test case, the first line contains two integers (length of the array and number of queries), the second line contains a list of integers (array c), and then for each query, a line contains two integers (left and right borders of the subarray). All integers are positive and the sum of the lengths of the arrays and the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
