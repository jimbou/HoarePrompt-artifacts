Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: the first line contains an integer (number of test cases), then for each test case, the first line contains two integers (length of the array and number of queries), the second line contains a list of integers (array c), and then for each query, a line contains two integers (left and right borders of the subarray). All integers are positive and the sum of the lengths of the arrays and the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: b is a list of n+1 positive integers where each element at index i (1 <= i <= n) is the sum of the number of occurrences of 1 and twice the number of occurrences of any other number in the subarray a[1..i].
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: the cumulative sums of the elements in the original list a
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration, depending on the condition a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y. The state of the variables a and b remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and queries on that array. For each test case, it calculates cumulative sums of the array elements and then answers queries by comparing the cumulative sum of a subarray with a calculated value. The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, depending on the comparison result. The function does not modify the input array or queries, and its output is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, one for each query.

Correctness: **True** or **False**
