Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of q+1 positive integers, b is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, for each query, a line contains two integers (left and right borders of the subarray).**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the variable `n` holds a positive integer value, which is the number of test cases. The variable `q` also holds a positive integer value, which is the number of queries. The list `a` contains `q+1` positive integers, where the first element is 0 (due to the `[0] +` part) and the remaining elements are the integers from the input list. The list `b` is initialized with `n+1` zeros. The stdin still contains multiple inputs, but now it only includes the lines containing two integers for each query, representing the left and right borders of the subarray.
