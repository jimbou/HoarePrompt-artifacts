This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and queries on that array. For each test case, it calculates cumulative sums of the array elements and then answers queries by comparing the cumulative sum of a subarray with a calculated value. The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, depending on the comparison result. The function does not modify the input array or queries, and its output is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, one for each query.
