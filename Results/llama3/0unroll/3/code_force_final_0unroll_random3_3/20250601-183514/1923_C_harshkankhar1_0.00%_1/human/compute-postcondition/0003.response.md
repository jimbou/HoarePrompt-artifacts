The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` as separate values, without the square brackets and commas that would be present if `a` were printed as a list.

Since `a` is a list of n+1 positive integers where each element at index i (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list a up to index i, the output will be the cumulative sums of the elements in the original list a.

Output: **the cumulative sums of the elements in the original list a**
