You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: the first line contains an integer (number of test cases), then for each test case, the first line contains two integers (length of the array and number of queries), the second line contains a list of integers (array c), and then for each query, a line contains two integers (left and right borders of the subarray). All integers are positive and the sum of the lengths of the arrays and the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: b is a list of n+1 positive integers where each element at index i (1 <= i <= n) is the sum of the number of occurrences of 1 and twice the number of occurrences of any other number in the subarray a[1..i].
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: the cumulative sums of the elements in the original list a
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration, depending on the condition a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y. The state of the variables a and b remains unchanged.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
