    #The program returns a list that contains the divisors of the second integer in `x` followed by the divisors of the first integer in `x` in reverse order. The first integer in `x` is greater than the second integer, and both integers are greater than 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than the second integer and both integers are greater than 0. It returns a list containing the divisors of the second integer followed by the divisors of the first integer in reverse order.
