Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

The program first checks if (n + x - 2) and (n - x) are even, and if so, it calculates the divisors of these numbers using the func_1 function. It then checks if the divisors are greater than or equal to x and if they are even. If both conditions are met, it adds the divisor to the output list.

The func_1 function correctly calculates the divisors of a number by iterating from 1 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by the current iteration. If it is, it adds the divisor and the quotient to the output list.

The program then removes duplicates from the output list by converting it to a set and back to a list.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including when n and x are equal, when n is less than x, and when n is greater than x. It also correctly handles cases where k is not an integer.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
