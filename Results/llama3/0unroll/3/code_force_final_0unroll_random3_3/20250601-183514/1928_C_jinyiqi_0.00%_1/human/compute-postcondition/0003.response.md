The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `output1`. Since `output1` is a list of divisors of the first integer in `x`, the reversed list will contain the same divisors but in reverse order.

Output State: **`x` is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than the second integer and both integers are greater than 0, `output1` is a list of divisors of the first integer in `x` in reverse order, `output2` is a list of divisors of the second integer in `x`.**

In other words, the list `output1` now contains the divisors of the first integer in `x` in the reverse order, while the other variables remain unchanged.
