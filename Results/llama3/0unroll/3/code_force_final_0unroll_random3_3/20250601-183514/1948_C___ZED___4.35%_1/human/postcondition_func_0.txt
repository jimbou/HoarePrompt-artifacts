This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two strings a and b of length n. It then determines whether there exists a path from the first character of string a to the last character of string b based on certain conditions. If the last second character of string b is not '>', it outputs 'NO'. If n is 1, it outputs 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if all characters at even indices in string b are '>' and all characters at odd indices in string a are '>'. If this condition is met, it outputs 'YES', indicating a path exists; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the result for each case.
