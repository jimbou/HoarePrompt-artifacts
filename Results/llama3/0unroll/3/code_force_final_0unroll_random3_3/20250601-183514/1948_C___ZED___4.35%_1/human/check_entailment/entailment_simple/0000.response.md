Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the last second character of string b is not '>'. If this condition is true, it means the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because it cannot move right from the second last cell. Therefore, it prints 'NO'.

2. If n is 1, the program prints 'YES' because the robot can always reach the cell (2, n) when n is 1.

3. For n greater than 1, the program checks if there is a path from the first character of string a to the last character of string b. It does this by checking two conditions:

   a. If all characters at even indices in string b are '>', it means the robot can move right from these cells.

   b. If all characters at odd indices in string a are '>', it means the robot can move right from these cells.

   If both conditions are true, it means there is a path from the first character of string a to the last character of string b, and the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
