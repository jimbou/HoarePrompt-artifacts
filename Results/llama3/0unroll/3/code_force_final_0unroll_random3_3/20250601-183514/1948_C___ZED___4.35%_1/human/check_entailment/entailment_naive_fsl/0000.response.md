Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

```
4
>><<
>>><
```

The program will print "NO", but the correct answer is "YES". The robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the arrow in the second row is pointing to the right, but it does not consider the arrows in the first row. In this case, the arrow in the first row at position 2 is pointing to the right, which allows the robot to move to the second row and then to the right.
