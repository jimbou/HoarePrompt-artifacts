Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. For each test case, if the last second character of string b is not '>', the output will be 'NO'. If n is 1, the output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES' if there is a path from the first character of string a to the last character of string b, and 'NO' otherwise. A path exists if all characters at even indices in string b are '>' and all characters at odd indices in string a are '>'.**
