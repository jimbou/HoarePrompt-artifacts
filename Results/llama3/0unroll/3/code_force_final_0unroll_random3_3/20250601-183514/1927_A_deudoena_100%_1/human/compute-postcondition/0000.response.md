The first line initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0. The second line reads a positive integer from stdin and assigns it to `m`. The third line reads a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The fourth line initializes `c` and `d` to 0. The fifth line initializes an empty list `l`.

Output State: **ma is 0, mi is 0, m is a positive integer, s is a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, c is 0, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple pairs of lines: the first line of each pair contains a positive integer and the second line contains a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.**
