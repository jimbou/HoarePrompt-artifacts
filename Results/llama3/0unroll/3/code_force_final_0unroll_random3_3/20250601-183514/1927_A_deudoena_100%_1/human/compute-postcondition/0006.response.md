Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes the first pair of lines, and returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in the second line of the pair, plus 2. The function does not modify the input or produce any side effects. It only consumes the first two lines of stdin and returns a calculated value based on the positions of 'B' characters in the second line.**
