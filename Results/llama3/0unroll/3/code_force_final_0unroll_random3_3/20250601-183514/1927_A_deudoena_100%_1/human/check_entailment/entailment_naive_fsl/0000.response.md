Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains only one 'B' character. In this case, the function `func_1()` returns 2, but the correct answer should be 1.

For example, if the input is:

1
B

The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1.

This is because the program is adding 2 to the difference between the indices of the first and last 'B' characters, but when there is only one 'B' character, this addition is incorrect.
