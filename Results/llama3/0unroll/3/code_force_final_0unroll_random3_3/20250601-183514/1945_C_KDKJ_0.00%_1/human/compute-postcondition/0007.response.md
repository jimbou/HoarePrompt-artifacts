Output: **The final value of ans is the index i in the string a that is closest to the middle of the string and has the property that the number of '1's to the left of i is at least half the total number of '1's to the left of i, and the number of '1's to the right of i is at least half the total number of '1's to the right of i. If no such index exists, ans remains 0. The values of n, a, S, stdin, and satisfy remain unchanged, and the final value of ans is being printed**
