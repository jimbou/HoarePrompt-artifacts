This function reads an integer and a string of '0' and '1' from standard input, then finds the index in the string that is closest to the middle and has the property that the number of '1's to the left of it is at least half the total number of '1's to the left of it, and the number of '1's to the right of it is at least half the total number of '1's to the right of it. If no such index exists, it returns 0. The function prints the result to standard output.
