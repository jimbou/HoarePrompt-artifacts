Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description. The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads an integer and a string of '0' and '1' from standard input, then finds the index in the string that is closest to the middle and has the property that the number of '1's to the left of it is at least half the total number of '1's to the left of it, and the number of '1's to the right of it is at least half the total number of '1's to the right of it. If no such index exists, it returns 0. The function prints the result to standard output.

`func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of 0s and 1s of equal length, and processes them using `func_1` without returning any output, leaving the standard input empty.

The program correctly implements the problem description by finding the index that satisfies the condition and is closest to the middle of the string. It also handles multiple test cases correctly by using `func_2` to read and process each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
