Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the base case where `n` is 2. In this case, it prints 2, which is the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to come to the party.
2.  For `n` greater than 2, the program checks for a specific condition in the list `v`. It iterates through the list to find an index `i` such that the value at the index `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. This condition indicates that there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
3.  If such an index `i` is found, the program prints 2 and terminates. This is because sending invitations to these two friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
4.  If no such index `i` is found after iterating through the entire list, the program prints 3. This is because in the worst-case scenario, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
