Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n in the order they appeared in the input. If n equals 2, the number 2 is printed. If n is greater than 2, the loop will print 2 and terminate as soon as it finds an index i such that v[v[v[i]]] equals i, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything if no such index is found, and then the number 3 is printed.***
