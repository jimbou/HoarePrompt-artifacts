Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party. 

The program first checks if the number of friends is 2, in which case it prints 2 because both friends need to be invited. 

For more than 2 friends, it checks for each friend if their best friend's best friend is themselves. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2 because inviting these two friends will result in at least 2 friends coming to the party. 

If it doesn't find such a pair, it prints 3 because in the worst case, Monocarp needs to invite 3 friends to guarantee that at least 2 friends will come to the party. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases and the logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
