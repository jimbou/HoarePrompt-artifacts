Functionality: **This function reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers from standard input, then checks for a specific condition in the list. If n is 2, it prints 2. Otherwise, it iterates through the list to find an index i such that the value at the index v[v[i]] equals i. If such an index is found, it prints 2 and terminates. If no such index is found after iterating through the entire list, it prints 3. The function does not modify the input values or the list, and it does not return any value.**
