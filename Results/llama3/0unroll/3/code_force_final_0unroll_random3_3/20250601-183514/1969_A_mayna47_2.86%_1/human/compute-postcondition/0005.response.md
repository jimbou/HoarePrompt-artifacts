Output State: **The loop will print 2 and terminate as soon as it finds an index i such that v[v[v[i]]] equals i, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything if no such index is found. The value of i will be the index at which the loop terminated, or n+1 if the loop completed all iterations. The values of t, n, and v remain unchanged.**
