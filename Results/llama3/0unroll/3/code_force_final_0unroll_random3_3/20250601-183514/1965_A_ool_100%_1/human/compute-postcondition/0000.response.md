Output State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged**

In this code snippet, the first line assigns the value False to the variable A. The second line creates a set from the list arr, which removes any duplicate values, and then converts this set back into a list. The third line sorts this list in ascending order. The original list arr remains unchanged throughout the execution of this code.
