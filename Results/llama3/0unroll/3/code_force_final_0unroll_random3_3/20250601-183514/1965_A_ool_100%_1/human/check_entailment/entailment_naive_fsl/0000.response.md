Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game in all cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which only checks if the smallest pile size is 1 and if the differences between consecutive pile sizes are 1. However, this is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

A counterexample is when the input is `[2, 2, 3, 3]`. The program will return `'Bob'`, but the correct answer is `'Alice'`. This is because Alice can choose `k=2` on her first turn, leaving the piles as `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, and then Bob will be unable to make a move, losing the game.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use the XOR operation. The XOR of all pile sizes determines the winner of the game. If the XOR is 0, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the XOR operation has the property that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`, which corresponds to the rules of the game.
