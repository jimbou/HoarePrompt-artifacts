Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on a given list of positive integers. It checks if the list contains consecutive integers starting from 1. If the list does not start with 1, the function immediately returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted list of unique integers, checking for gaps between consecutive numbers. If a gap is found, the function returns 'Bob'. If no gaps are found, the function returns 'Alice' if the list starts with 1 and 'Bob' otherwise.**
