Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given list of positive integers. The function `func_1` checks if the list contains consecutive integers starting from 1, and if not, it immediately returns 'Alice'. If the list starts with 1, it iterates through the sorted list of unique integers, checking for gaps between consecutive numbers. If a gap is found, the function returns 'Bob'. If no gaps are found, the function returns 'Alice' if the list starts with 1 and 'Bob' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the list does not start with 1, or when the list contains gaps between consecutive numbers. The use of a set to remove duplicates and the sorting of the set are also correct.

The overall logic of the program is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
