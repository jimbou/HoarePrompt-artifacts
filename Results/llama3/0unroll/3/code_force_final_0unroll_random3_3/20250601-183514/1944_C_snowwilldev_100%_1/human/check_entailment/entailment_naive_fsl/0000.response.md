Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game's strategy to maximize the score. The key insight is that Alice wants to maximize the MEX of her array `c`, which means she wants to include as many small numbers as possible. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, which means he wants to remove as many small numbers as possible.

The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `a`. It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `N` (the size of the input array) and checks if the count of each number is 1. If it is, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` becomes 2 or if the count of a number is 0, it returns the current number `i`.

The reasoning behind this is that if a number has a count of 1, it means that Bob can remove it, and Alice can't include it in her array `c`. If there are two such numbers, it means that Bob can remove both of them, and Alice can't include either of them in her array `c`. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be at least `i + 1`. If the count of a number is 0, it means that the number is not present in the input array `a`, so it can't be included in `c` either.

The program correctly implements this strategy and returns the correct MEX of `c` for all possible inputs.
