Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `N` representing the number of elements in the list, followed by a list of `N` non-negative integers.
2.  It creates a dictionary `cnt` to store the frequency of each number in the list. This is done efficiently using a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module.
3.  The program then iterates over the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive) and checks the count of each number in the `cnt` dictionary.
4.  If it finds a number with a count of 1, it increments a counter `t`. If `t` becomes 2 or greater, or if it encounters a number with a count of 0, it immediately returns the current index `i`. This is because the MEX of the array `c` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in `c`, which is either the first missing number or the second number that appears exactly once.
5.  If the loop completes without finding a number with a count of 0 or the second number with a count of 1, it returns `N`, which is the total count of numbers. This is because the MEX of the array `c` will be `N` if all numbers from 0 to `N-1` are present in `c`.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score while Bob tries to minimize it. The use of a `defaultdict` for counting frequencies and the early return conditions make the program efficient.

Correctness: **True**
