Output State: **The cnt dictionary contains the frequency of each number in the list a, where the key is the number and the value is the count. The variable t is assigned the value 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that the code has introduced a new variable `t` and assigned it the value 0, while leaving all other variables, including the `cnt` dictionary, unchanged. The `cnt` dictionary still contains the frequency of each number in the list `a`, with the key being the number and the value being the count.
