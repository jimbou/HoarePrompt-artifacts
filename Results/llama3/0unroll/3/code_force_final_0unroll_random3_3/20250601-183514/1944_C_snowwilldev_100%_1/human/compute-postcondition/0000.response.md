Output State: **N is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than N, cnt is an empty dictionary, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `N`. Since `N` is a positive integer, `N` becomes a positive integer. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Since `a` contains non-negative integers less than `N`, `a` becomes a list of non-negative integers less than `N`. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `cnt`. Since `cnt` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` remains an empty dictionary. Stdin contains multiple test cases, and since one test case is processed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.
