Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation p based on the array a. The problem description states that a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i, where MEX is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array. However, the program does not correctly calculate the MEX value.

For example, consider the input:

3
-2 1 2

The program will output:

2 0 1

However, this is not a valid permutation. The correct permutation should be:

2 0 1

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when a_i is negative. In this case, the program should subtract the absolute value of a_i from the current MEX value, but it does not do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
