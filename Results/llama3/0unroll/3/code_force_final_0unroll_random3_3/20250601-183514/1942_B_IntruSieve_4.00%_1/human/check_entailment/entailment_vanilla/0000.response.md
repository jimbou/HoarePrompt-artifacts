Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating through the array `a` and constructing the permutation `p` based on the values of `a`. The program uses two variables, `minn` and `maxx`, to keep track of the minimum and maximum values of the permutation `p` that have been constructed so far.

The program first checks if the current value of `a` is positive. If it is, the program appends the current value of `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, the program increments `minn` again to ensure that it is always greater than `maxx`.

If the current value of `a` is not positive, the program appends the absolute difference between `minn` and the current value of `a` to the `mex` list. If this value is greater than `maxx`, the program updates `maxx` to be this value.

Finally, the program prints the values in the `mex` list, which represents the constructed permutation `p`.

However, there are several issues with this program:

1. The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the permutation `p`. The MEX is the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the permutation, but the program does not take this into account when constructing the permutation.
2. The program does not correctly handle the case where the value of `a` is negative. In this case, the program should append the absolute difference between `minn` and the current value of `a` to the `mex` list, but it does not do so correctly.
3. The program does not correctly update the values of `minn` and `maxx` when constructing the permutation. The program should update these values based on the values of `a` and the constructed permutation `p`, but it does not do so correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
