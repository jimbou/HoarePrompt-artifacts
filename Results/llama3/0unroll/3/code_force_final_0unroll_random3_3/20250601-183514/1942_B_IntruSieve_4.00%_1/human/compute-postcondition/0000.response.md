Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The code reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It then reads a space-separated list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to the list `arr`. The range of each integer in `arr` is between `-n` and `n`. The variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` are initialized as an empty list, 0, and 0, respectively. After the code executes, `n` and `arr` are updated with the values read from stdin, while `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t - 1` test cases.
