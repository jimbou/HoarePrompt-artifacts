Functionality: **This function reads an integer n and a list of n integers from standard input, processes the list to generate a new list of integers, and prints the new list to the console. The function appears to calculate the minimum excluded value (mex) for each element in the input list, considering both positive and negative values, and outputs the resulting mex values. The function repeats this process for multiple test cases, as indicated by the initial integer t read from standard input.**
