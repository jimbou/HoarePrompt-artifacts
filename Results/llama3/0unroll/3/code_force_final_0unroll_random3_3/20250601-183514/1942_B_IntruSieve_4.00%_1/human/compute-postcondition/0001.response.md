Output State: The list `mex` contains `n` integers, where each integer is either the minimum value `minn` at the time of its insertion or the absolute difference between the current element in `arr` and `minn`. The variable `minn` is the maximum value in `mex` plus one, and `maxx` is the maximum absolute difference between any element in `arr` and `minn`. The value of `n` and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
