Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, and the array `a`.

2. The program initializes two variables, `minn` and `maxx`, to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

3. The program then iterates over the array `a`. For each element `a[i]`, it checks if `a[i]` is positive or negative.

   - If `a[i]` is positive, it means that the `i-th` element in the permutation is the current minimum value `minn`. So, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` again to ensure that `minn` is always greater than `maxx`.

   - If `a[i]` is negative, it means that the `i-th` element in the permutation is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the current minimum value `minn`. So, it appends `abs(a[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list and updates `maxx` if necessary.

4. After processing all elements in the array `a`, the program prints the `mex` list, which represents the permutation `p`.

5. The program repeats this process for all test cases.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles both positive and negative values in the array `a` correctly. It also ensures that the permutation `p` is valid by maintaining the correct minimum and maximum values.

Correctness: **True**
