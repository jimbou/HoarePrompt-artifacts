#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n).
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: mex is a list of n integers, minn is the maximum value in mex plus 1, maxx is the maximum absolute difference between any element in arr and minn, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The list of integers in mex has been printed to the console, with each integer separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: Nothing (an empty line)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer n and a list of n integers from standard input, processes the list to generate a new list of integers, and prints the new list to the console. The function appears to calculate the minimum excluded value (mex) for each element in the input list, considering both positive and negative values, and outputs the resulting mex values. The function repeats this process for multiple test cases, as indicated by the initial integer t read from standard input.
