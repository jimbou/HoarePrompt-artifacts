Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation p based on an array a, where a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i. The program uses a list `mex` to store the constructed permutation.

The program first reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads the length of the permutation n and the array a. It initializes two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

The program then iterates over the array a. If the current element is positive, it appends the current `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. If `minn` is equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` again to ensure that `minn` is always greater than `maxx`.

If the current element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the current element and `minn` to the `mex` list. If this difference is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.

Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `mex` to the console.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
