#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= 10^12). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^12).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        m = min(a)
        
        ans = 0
        
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the final value of the variable "ans" for each test case. The value of "ans" is calculated based on the input values of n, k, and the list of integers a. If k is greater than or equal to n times the minimum value in the list a, then ans is set to the factorial of n. Otherwise, the list a is modified by subtracting the minimum value from each element and then adding the minimum value plus the minimum of k and the integer division of k by n minus the current element. The value of k is then updated by subtracting the minimum of k and the integer division of k by n minus the current element. Finally, ans is calculated as the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the modified list a.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It calculates a value 'ans' based on these inputs. If k is greater than or equal to n times the minimum value in the list of integers, 'ans' is set to the factorial of n. Otherwise, it modifies the list of integers by subtracting the minimum value and adding a calculated value based on k and the integer division of k by n. It then calculates 'ans' as the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the modified list. The function prints the final value of 'ans' for each test case.
