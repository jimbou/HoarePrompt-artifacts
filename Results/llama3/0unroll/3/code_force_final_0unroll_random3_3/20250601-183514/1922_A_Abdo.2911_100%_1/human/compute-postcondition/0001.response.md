Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, if there exists a position i where a[i] is not equal to b[i] and c[i] is not equal to a[i] or b[i], then 'YES' will be printed, otherwise 'NO' will be printed. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed will be equal to the value of t. The values of t, n, a, b, and c will remain unchanged.
