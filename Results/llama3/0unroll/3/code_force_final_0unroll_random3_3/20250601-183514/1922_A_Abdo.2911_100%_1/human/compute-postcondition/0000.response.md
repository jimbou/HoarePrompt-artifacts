The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input. The stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20) followed by three strings `a`, `b`, `c`, each consisting of `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
