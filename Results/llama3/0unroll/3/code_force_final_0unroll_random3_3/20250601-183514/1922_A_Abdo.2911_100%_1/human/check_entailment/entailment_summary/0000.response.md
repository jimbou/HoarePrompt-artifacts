Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c.
2. If the characters at the current position in a and b are the same, it checks if the character at the same position in c is different. If it is, it sets the `possible` flag to True and breaks the loop.
3. If the characters at the current position in a and b are different, it checks if the character at the same position in c is the same as either the character in a or the character in b. If it is not, it sets the `possible` flag to True and breaks the loop.
4. If the loop completes without finding a position where the conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

This logic correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description, and the program produces the correct output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
