Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The program iterates through each character of the strings a, b, and c. If the characters at the current position in a and b are the same, it checks if the character at the same position in c is different. If it is, it sets the possible flag to True and breaks the loop. If the characters at the current position in a and b are different, it checks if the character at the same position in c is the same as either a or b. If it is not, it sets the possible flag to True and breaks the loop.

The program then prints 'YES' if the possible flag is True, indicating that a template t exists that matches a and b but not c. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when a and b have the same character at a position, when a and b have different characters at a position, and when c has the same or different character at a position compared to a and b.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input strings are empty or have only one character.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
