Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 6, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
5 5
6 6

However, this output does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. A correct output for n = 6 would be:

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1

This output has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances, which is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. The program's output, on the other hand, has a set of distinct Manhattan distances of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is smaller.
