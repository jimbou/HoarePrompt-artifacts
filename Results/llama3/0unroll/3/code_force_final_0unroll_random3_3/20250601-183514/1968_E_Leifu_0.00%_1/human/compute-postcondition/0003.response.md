Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `t` from standard input, then for each of `t` iterations, it reads another positive integer `n` and prints a series of pairs of numbers. The pairs are always '1 1' and '1 2', followed by either '2 3' if `n` is 3, or '2 4' and then consecutive pairs from '4 4' to `n` `n` if `n` is greater than 3. After processing all iterations, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
