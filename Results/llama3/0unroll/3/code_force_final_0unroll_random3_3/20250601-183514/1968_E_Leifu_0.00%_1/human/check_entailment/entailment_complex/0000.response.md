Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads a positive integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another positive integer `n` and prints a series of pairs of numbers that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's logic is based on the examples provided in the problem description. For `n = 2`, it prints the pairs `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. For `n = 3`, it prints the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`, which also maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For `n > 3`, the program prints the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and then consecutive pairs from `(4, 4)` to `(n, n)`. This pattern is based on the examples provided in the problem description, which show that this arrangement maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for `n = 4`, `n = 5`, and `n = 6`.

Since the program's logic is based on the examples provided in the problem description, and it correctly implements the patterns shown in those examples, it is likely that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
