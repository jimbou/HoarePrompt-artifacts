Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program starts by printing the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for all test cases. This is a valid starting point, as these two cells will always have a Manhattan distance of 1.

For the case where n is 3, the program prints the coordinates (2, 3). This is also a valid choice, as it adds a new Manhattan distance of 2 to the set.

For the case where n is greater than 3, the program prints the coordinates (2, 4) and then prints the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n. This is also a valid choice, as it adds new Manhattan distances to the set.

However, the program does not handle the case where n is 2 correctly. For n = 2, the program should only print the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2), but it also prints the coordinates (2, 3) which is not valid for n = 2.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
