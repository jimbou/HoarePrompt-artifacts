Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The coordinates are printed in the format "x y", where x and y are the row and column numbers of the cell, respectively.

The program uses a simple algorithm to determine the coordinates of the cells. For n = 2, it prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2). For n = 3, it prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3). For n >= 4, it prints the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and then for each j from 4 to n, it prints the coordinates (j, j).

The program's output matches the expected output for the given problem, and it correctly handles the different cases for n. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
