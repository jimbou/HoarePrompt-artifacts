Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only contains one input: a binary string of the same length as `t`. The integer input has been consumed and assigned to `t`.
