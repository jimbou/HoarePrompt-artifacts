Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer and a binary string of the same length. It then checks each binary string against specific conditions: if the string contains no '1's, an even number of '1's greater than 2, or exactly two '1's that are not adjacent, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and outputs a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one for each test case, indicating whether the corresponding binary string meets the specified conditions.**
