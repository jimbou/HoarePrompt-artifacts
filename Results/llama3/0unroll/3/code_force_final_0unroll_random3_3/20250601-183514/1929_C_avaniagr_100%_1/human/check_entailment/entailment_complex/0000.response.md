Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins in a casino game with certain rules. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers: k, x, and a.

The program handles three cases:

1. When x is less than k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+1. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

2. When x is equal to k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+2. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. When x is greater than or equal to k-1, it calculates a value z based on k and x, and checks if a is greater than or equal to z. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

The program's logic is based on the idea that Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins if he has enough initial coins (a) to cover the maximum possible losses (x) and still have enough coins to make a winning bet.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
