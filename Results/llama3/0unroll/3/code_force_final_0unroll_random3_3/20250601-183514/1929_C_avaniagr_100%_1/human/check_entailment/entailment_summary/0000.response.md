Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program handles three cases based on the values of 'k' and 'x', and for each case, it correctly calculates the minimum value of 'a' required to guarantee a win. The program then compares the given value of 'a' with the calculated minimum value and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible scenarios. The use of a loop to calculate the minimum value of 'a' when 'x' is greater than or equal to 'k-1' is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
