Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers: k, x, and a. It then evaluates whether the value of 'a' is sufficient based on the values of 'k' and 'x', and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console for each test case, indicating whether the condition is met. The condition is met if 'a' is greater than or equal to a calculated value that depends on 'k' and 'x'. The function handles three cases: when 'x' is less than 'k-1', when 'x' is equal to 'k-1', and when 'x' is greater than or equal to 'k-1'.**
