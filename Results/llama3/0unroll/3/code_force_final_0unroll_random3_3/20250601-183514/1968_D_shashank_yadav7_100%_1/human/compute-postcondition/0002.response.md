Output State: **The loop will execute 't' number of times, each time processing a test case from the standard input. For each test case, it will determine the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the given rules and print the result. The output will be a sequence of 't' lines, each containing the name of the winner or 'Draw' if the scores are equal. The values of 'n', 'k', 'p', 'a', 'b', 's', 'sp', 'bp', 'bm', and 'sm' will be updated for each test case, but their initial values will be lost after the loop finishes. The final state will only contain the output of the loop, which is the sequence of winners or 'Draw' for each test case.**
