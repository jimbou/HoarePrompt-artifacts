Output State: The loop will execute 't' number of times, where 't' is the number of test cases provided in the input. For each test case, the loop will determine the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the given conditions and print the result. The output will be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', depending on the calculated values of 'bm' and 'sm'. The values of 'n', 'k', 'p', 'a', 'b', 's', 'sp', 'bp', 'bm', and 'sm' will be updated for each test case, but the values of 't' will remain unchanged.
