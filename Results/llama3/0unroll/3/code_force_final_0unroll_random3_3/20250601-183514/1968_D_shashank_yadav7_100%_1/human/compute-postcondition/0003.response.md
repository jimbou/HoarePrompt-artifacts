Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four lines of integers, and determines the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the given rules. It prints the result of each test case, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' if the scores are equal. The function processes each test case independently, updating variables accordingly, and outputs a sequence of winners or 'Draw' for each test case.**
