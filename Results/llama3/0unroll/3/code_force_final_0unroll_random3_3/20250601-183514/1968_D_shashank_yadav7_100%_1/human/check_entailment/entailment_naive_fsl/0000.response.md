Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the game lasts for more than `n` turns, where `n` is the length of the permutation. In this case, the players will start to repeat their moves, and the program does not take this into account.

For example, consider the input:

```
1
4 5 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

In this case, the game lasts for 5 turns, but the permutation has only 4 elements. The program will not correctly calculate the scores for the players in this case.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle the case when the game lasts for more than `n` turns. One possible way to do this is to use a loop that runs for `k` turns, and inside the loop, update the positions of the players and their scores accordingly. The loop should also check if the players have reached a position that they have already visited before, and if so, update their scores accordingly.
