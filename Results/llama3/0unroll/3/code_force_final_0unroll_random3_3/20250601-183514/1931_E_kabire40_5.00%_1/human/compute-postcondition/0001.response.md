Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and m, and the second line contains n integers. The function processes these integers by reversing them and sorting them in a specific way. It then compares the resulting number to 10 raised to the power of m. If the resulting number is greater, it prints 'Sasha' to the console; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function repeats this process for each test case, printing one result per case.**
