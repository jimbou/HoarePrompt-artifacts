Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'Sasha' or 'Anna' printed to the console, one for each test case. The output will depend on whether the reversed and sorted number is greater than 10 to the power of the given max_power. If it is, 'Sasha' will be printed, otherwise 'Anna' will be printed. The number of outputs will be equal to the initial integer t.**
