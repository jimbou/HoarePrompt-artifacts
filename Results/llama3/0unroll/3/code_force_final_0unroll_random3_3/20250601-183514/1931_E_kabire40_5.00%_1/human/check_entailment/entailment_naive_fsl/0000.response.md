Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The problem description states that Sasha can extract two elements from the list, concatenate them in any order, and insert the result back into the list. However, the program does not consider all possible concatenations of the elements. It only considers the concatenation of the reversed elements in the order they appear in the list.

A counterexample is when the input list is [12, 34] and the maximum power is 3. The program will output "Anna", but the correct output should be "Sasha". This is because Sasha can extract the elements 12 and 34, concatenate them in the order 34 and 12, and insert the result 3412 back into the list, which is greater than 10^3.

The program does not consider all possible moves that Sasha can make, and therefore, it does not correctly determine the winner of the game.
