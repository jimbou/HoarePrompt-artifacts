Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the size of the array, Polycarp's favorite integers x and y, and the elements of the array.
2.  The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of test cases as input. Each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array, x, y, and the array itself.
3.  Within the `func_1` function, the program iterates over each test case and initializes a variable `count` to 0, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
4.  The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the residues of the array elements modulo x and y. The keys of the dictionary are tuples of the form `(num % x, num % y)`, and the values are the counts of each residue pair.
5.  The program iterates over each element `num` in the array. For each `num`, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` modulo x and y, respectively.
6.  The program checks if the residue pair `(r_x, r_y)` is already present in the `residue_map`. If it is, it increments the `count` by the value associated with that residue pair. This is because each occurrence of the residue pair corresponds to a beautiful pair.
7.  The program then updates the `residue_map` by incrementing the count of the current residue pair `(num % x, num % y)`.
8.  After iterating over all elements in the array, the program appends the `count` of beautiful pairs to the `results` list.
9.  Finally, the program returns the `results` list, which contains the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
