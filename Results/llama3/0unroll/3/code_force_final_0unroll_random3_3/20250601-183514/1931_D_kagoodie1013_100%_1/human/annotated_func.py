#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0

        for num in arr:

    #State: Output State: The list `results` contains the count of pairs of numbers in each test case that have the same residue modulo x and y.
    return results
    #The program returns the list 'results' which contains the count of pairs of numbers in each test case that have the same residue modulo x and y.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It calculates the count of pairs of numbers in each test case that have the same residue modulo x and y, and returns a list of these counts. The function iterates over each test case, calculates the residue modulo x and y for each number, and increments a counter for each pair of numbers with the same residue. The final state of the program is a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs of numbers with the same residue modulo x and y in the corresponding test case.
