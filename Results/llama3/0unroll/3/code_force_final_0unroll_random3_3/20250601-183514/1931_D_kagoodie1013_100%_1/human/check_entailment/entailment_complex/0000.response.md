Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary (residue_map) to store the residues of the numbers in the array modulo x and y. It then iterates over the array, calculates the residue modulo x and y for each number, and increments a counter for each pair of numbers with the same residue.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It handles the cases where the residues modulo x and y are the same, which is the condition for a pair to be beautiful.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the residue modulo x as -num % x, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be num % x.

Correctness: **False**

The program will produce incorrect results due to the incorrect calculation of the residue modulo x.
