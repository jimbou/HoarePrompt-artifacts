Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n; `results` is an empty list**

In natural language, the output state is that the initial list of test cases remains unchanged, and a new empty list called `results` has been created.
