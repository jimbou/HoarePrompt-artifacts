This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It calculates the count of pairs of numbers in each test case that have the same residue modulo x and y, and returns a list of these counts. The function iterates over each test case, calculates the residue modulo x and y for each number, and increments a counter for each pair of numbers with the same residue. The final state of the program is a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs of numbers with the same residue modulo x and y in the corresponding test case.
