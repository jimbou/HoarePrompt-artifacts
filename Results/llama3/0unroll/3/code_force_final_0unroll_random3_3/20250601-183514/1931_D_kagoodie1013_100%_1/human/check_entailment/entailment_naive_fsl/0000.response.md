Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The program uses a dictionary to store the residues of the numbers in the array modulo x and y, and then for each number, it checks if there is a pair that satisfies the conditions by checking if the residue of the sum and difference of the numbers is present in the dictionary. The program also correctly handles the case when the numbers are equal.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. The use of a dictionary to store the residues allows for efficient lookup and counting of the pairs, and the program correctly handles all possible cases.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
