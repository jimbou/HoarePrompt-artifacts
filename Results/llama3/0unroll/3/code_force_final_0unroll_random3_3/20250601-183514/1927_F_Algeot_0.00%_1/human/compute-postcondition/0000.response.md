The code `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to 10^6. This means that the interpreter can now handle recursive calls up to a depth of 10^6, which is a much larger limit than the default limit.

Output State: **The maximum recursion limit is set to 10^6, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of multiple lines. The first line contains two integers n and m. The next m lines contain three integers u, v, and w.**
