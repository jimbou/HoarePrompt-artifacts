This function takes a positive integer 't' and a list of 't' test cases as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer 'n' and a list of 'n' positive integers. It calculates the number of operations required to make all elements in the heap greater than the median for each test case and returns a list of 't' integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed on the corresponding test case.
