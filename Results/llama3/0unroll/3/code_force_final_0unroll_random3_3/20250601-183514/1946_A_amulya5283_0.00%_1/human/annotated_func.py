    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of two elements: the first element is a positive integer `n`, the second element is a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed on the corresponding test case to make all elements in the heap greater than the median.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed on the corresponding test case to make all elements in the heap greater than the median. The list contains 't' integers, where 't' is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer 't' and a list of 't' test cases as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer 'n' and a list of 'n' positive integers. It calculates the number of operations required to make all elements in the heap greater than the median for each test case and returns a list of 't' integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed on the corresponding test case.
