Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program sorts the input array and finds the median. It then uses a heap to keep track of the numbers that need to be increased to increase the median. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including cases where the median is already the maximum number in the array, cases where the median is not unique, and cases where the array contains duplicate numbers.

The use of a heap is an efficient way to keep track of the numbers that need to be increased, as it allows the program to easily find the smallest number that needs to be increased and to update the heap after each operation.

The program also correctly handles the case where the length of the array is odd, in which case the median is the middle number, and the case where the length of the array is even, in which case the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
