Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program first sorts the array and finds the median. Then, it creates a heap from the elements greater than or equal to the median. It repeatedly increments the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the median, counting the number of operations. This approach ensures that the median is increased with the minimum number of operations.

Correctness: **True**
