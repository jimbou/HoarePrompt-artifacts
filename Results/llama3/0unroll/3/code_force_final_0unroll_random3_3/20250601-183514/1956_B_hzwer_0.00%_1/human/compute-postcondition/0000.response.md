Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, cards is a list of n integers between 1 and n, dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[n - 1][0] and dp[n - 2][0] which are both 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

Explanation: The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5. The second line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `cards`, which is now a list of `n` integers between 1 and `n`. The third line creates a 2D list `dp` of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0. The fourth and fifth lines set `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` to 0, respectively. Since `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `dp` is a large 2D list with most elements still being 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one.
