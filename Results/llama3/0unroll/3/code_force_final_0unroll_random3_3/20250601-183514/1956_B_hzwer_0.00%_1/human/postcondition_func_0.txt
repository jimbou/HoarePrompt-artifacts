This function determines the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from a given set of cards, with each card used at most once and each pair having a unique card. It takes no parameters and returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed. The function assumes that the input is provided through standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the number of cards, and the second line contains the integers on the cards. The function processes each test case and returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed for each case.
