Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dp array is used to store the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player for each possible state of the game. The state of the game is represented by the number of cards remaining in the player's hand and the number of cards on the table.

The program iterates over the cards in the player's hand in reverse order, and for each card, it checks the number of times the card appears in the player's hand. If the card appears twice, the program considers three possibilities: playing the card, not playing the card, and playing the card and then playing another card with the same number. The program chooses the possibility that maximizes the number of points scored.

The program also handles the case where the card appears only once in the player's hand, in which case it simply plays the card.

The program's time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of cards in the player's hand. This is because the program iterates over the cards in the player's hand in reverse order, and for each card, it checks the number of times the card appears in the player's hand.

The program's space complexity is also O(n^2), because it uses a 2D array to store the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player for each possible state of the game.

Overall, the program is correct because it uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
