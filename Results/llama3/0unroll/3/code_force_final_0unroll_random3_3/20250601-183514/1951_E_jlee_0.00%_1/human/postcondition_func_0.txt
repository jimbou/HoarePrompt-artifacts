This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It checks if the string can be split into two substrings with different characters at the same position. If possible, it prints 'YES', the split position, and the resulting substrings; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles various cases, including strings with only one character, strings with all characters the same, and strings with an odd or even length. It iterates through the string to find the split position, if any, and prints the result accordingly.
