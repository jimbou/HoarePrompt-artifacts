Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  The program first checks if the length of the string is 1. If it is, it prints 'NO' because a single character cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
2.  It then checks if the first and last characters of the string are different. If they are, it prints 'YES' and the original string because the string is already non-palindromic.
3.  If the first and last characters are the same, it checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints 'NO' because any partition of the string would result in palindromic substrings.
4.  If not all characters are the same, it checks if the count of the first character is equal to the length of the string minus 1. If it is, it checks if the middle character (if the length is odd) is different from the first character. If it is, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the original string.
5.  If the count of the first character is not equal to the length of the string minus 1, it iterates through the string to find a pair of characters that are different. If it finds such a pair, it prints 'YES', the split position, and the resulting substrings.
6.  If it doesn't find any pair of different characters, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and produces the expected output for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
