The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

Since the initial state specifies that the first line of stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases, the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The values of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6). The sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
