Output: **The values of n, m, k, D, and F remain unchanged. The variable max_diff still holds the maximum difference between consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff still holds the second maximum difference, and index still holds the index of the maximum difference. The variables left and right have been assigned the values of A[index - 1] and A[index], respectively. The variable ans has been assigned the minimum value of the maximum differences between the elements of D and the values of left and right, considering the values of f in F. The maximum value between the minimum value of the maximum differences between the elements of D and the values of left and right, considering the values of f in F, and the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A is being printed.**
