This function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list A, and then finds the minimum value of the maximum differences between the elements of a sorted list D and the values of the left and right boundaries of the maximum difference in A, considering a list of non-negative integers F. It returns the maximum value between the minimum value of these maximum differences and the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in A.
