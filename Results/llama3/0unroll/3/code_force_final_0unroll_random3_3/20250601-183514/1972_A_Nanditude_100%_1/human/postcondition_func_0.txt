This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and two lists of n non-decreasing integers, a and b. For each test case, it counts the number of elements in list b that are less than the corresponding elements in list a and prints this count to the console. The function does not modify the input state, leaving the standard input unchanged.
