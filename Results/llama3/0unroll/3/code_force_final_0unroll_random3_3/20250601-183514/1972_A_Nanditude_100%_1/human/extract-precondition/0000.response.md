Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the second line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the third line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**
