Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the second line contains a list of n non-decreasing integers b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains the remaining input for each test case, which consists of two lines: the first line contains a list of non-decreasing integers `a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ a_n`, and the second line contains a list of non-decreasing integers `b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ⋯ ≤ b_n`.
