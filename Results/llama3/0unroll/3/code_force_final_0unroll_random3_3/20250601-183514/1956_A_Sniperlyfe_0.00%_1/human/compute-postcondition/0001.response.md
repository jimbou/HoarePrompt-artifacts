Output State: **The output state is the same as the initial state, with the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `res` changed after each iteration of the loop. The final output state will have the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `res` from the last iteration of the loop. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged.**
