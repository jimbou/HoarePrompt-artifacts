Functionality: **This function takes no arguments and returns no values. It reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. The input consists of a number of test cases, each containing a positive integer k, a positive integer q, a list of positive integers p, and a list of positive integers qs. For each test case, the function calls another function func_1 with each element of qs and the list p as arguments, appends the result to a list res, and prints the current state of res after each call. The function does not modify the input values or have any side effects beyond printing the results.**
