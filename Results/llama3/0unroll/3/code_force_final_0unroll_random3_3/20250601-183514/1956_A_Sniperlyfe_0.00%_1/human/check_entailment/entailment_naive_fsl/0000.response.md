Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function simulates the game by repeatedly removing players from the game until no more players can be removed. The `func_2` function reads the input, calls `func_1` for each query, and prints the results.

The program correctly handles the case where a player is skipped if there are fewer than `i` players in a row, as described in the problem statement. It also correctly handles the case where no players are removed in a round, which means the game ends.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided in the problem statement, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I have also tried to think of potential edge cases, such as an empty list of players or a list of players with a single element, and the program handles these cases correctly as well.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
