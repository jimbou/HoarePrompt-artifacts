Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that for all i, 1 <= p[i] <= n, `t` is an integer, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of n remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list p also remains unchanged, containing positive integers within the range of 1 to n. A new variable t is introduced, which is assigned an integer value from the input. After this assignment, the stdin is empty, indicating that it has been fully consumed.
