Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described in the problem statement. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `p`, and simulates the game described in the problem statement. It repeatedly removes players from the game until no more players can be removed, and then returns the number of remaining players. `func_2` reads input from the user, calls `func_1` for each query, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the game simulation and query processing as described in the problem statement. The use of the `while` loop in `func_1` ensures that the game simulation continues until no more players can be removed, and the `sum` function is used to count the number of players to be removed in each round. The `for` loop in `func_2` iterates over the queries and calls `func_1` for each query, storing the results in the `res` list. Finally, the program prints the results for each query.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
