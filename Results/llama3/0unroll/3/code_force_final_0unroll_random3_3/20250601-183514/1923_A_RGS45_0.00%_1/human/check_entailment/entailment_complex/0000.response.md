Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases `t`, the number of cells `n`, and the list of cells `arr`.
2. It finds the first occurrence of '1' in the array using `arr.find('1')`, which gives the starting index `x` of the subarray containing the chips.
3. It finds the last occurrence of '1' in the array by reversing the array and finding the first occurrence of '1' using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. This gives the ending index `y` of the subarray containing the chips.
4. It extracts the subarray `z` containing the chips by slicing the original array from `x` to `n - y`.
5. It counts the number of zeros in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')`, which gives the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when all chips are already in a single block (in which case the output is 0). The time complexity is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
