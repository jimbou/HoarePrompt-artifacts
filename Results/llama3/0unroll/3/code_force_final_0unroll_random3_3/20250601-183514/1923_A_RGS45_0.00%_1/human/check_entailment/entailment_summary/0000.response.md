Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin, which includes the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the array itself.
2.  It finds the first and last occurrences of '1' in the array, which represent the start and end of the block of chips.
3.  It extracts the subarray between the first and last occurrences of '1', which is the block of chips that needs to be moved together.
4.  It counts the number of zeros in this subarray, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips together.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. It handles multiple test cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
