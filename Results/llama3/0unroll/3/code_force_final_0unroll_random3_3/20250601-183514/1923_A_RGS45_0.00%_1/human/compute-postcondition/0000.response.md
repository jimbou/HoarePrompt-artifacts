Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains 2*t lines. Each of the following t blocks of two lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n space-separated integers (0 <= a_i <= 1) respectively.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains 2*t lines, where each block of two lines contains an integer n and a list of n space-separated integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.
