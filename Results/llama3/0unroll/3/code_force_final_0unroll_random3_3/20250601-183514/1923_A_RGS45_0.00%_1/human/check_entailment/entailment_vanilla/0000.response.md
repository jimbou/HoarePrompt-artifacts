Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to move chips in a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and a string `arr` representing the cells.

3. The program uses the `find()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`, which represents the first chip from the left. It also finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`, which represents the first chip from the right.

4. The program then extracts a substring `z` from `arr` starting from the index of the first chip from the left `x` to the index of the first chip from the right `n - y`.

5. Finally, the program prints the count of '0' characters in the substring `z`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

6. The program's logic is correct because it identifies the range of cells that need to be moved to form a single block and counts the number of free cells within that range, which is the minimum number of operations required.

Correctness: **True**
