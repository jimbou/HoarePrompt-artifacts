Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the count of zeros in a subarray of the input array. The subarray starts from the first occurrence of '1' and ends at the last occurrence of '1'. The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n space-separated integers. The function prints the count of zeros for each test case.**
