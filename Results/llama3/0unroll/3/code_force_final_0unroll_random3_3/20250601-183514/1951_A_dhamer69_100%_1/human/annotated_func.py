#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). The second line contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50).
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        if n == 2:
            if s == '00':
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            count_1 = s.count('1')
            if count_1 % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')
            elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: The loop will finish executing after processing all the test cases from the standard input, and the value of `t` will be 0. The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the given binary string can be rearranged into a palindrome or not. The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' lines, one for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then determines whether the binary string can be rearranged into a palindrome and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating the result. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in a series of 'YES' or 'NO' lines.
