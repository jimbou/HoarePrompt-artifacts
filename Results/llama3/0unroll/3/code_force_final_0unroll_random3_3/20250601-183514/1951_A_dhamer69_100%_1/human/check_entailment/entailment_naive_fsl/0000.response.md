Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether a given binary string configuration can be reached by turning on non-adjacent lamps. The program handles the edge case where n = 2 correctly, and for n > 2, it checks if the count of '1's is even and if there are any adjacent '1's. If either condition is not met, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description.
