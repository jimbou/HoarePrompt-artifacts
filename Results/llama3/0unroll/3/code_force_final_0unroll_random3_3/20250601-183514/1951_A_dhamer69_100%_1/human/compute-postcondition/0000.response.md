The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of each test case contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The second line of each test case, which contains a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= n <= 50), is still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each with one line of input: a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= n <= 50).**
