This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then determines whether the binary string can be rearranged into a palindrome and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating the result. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in a series of 'YES' or 'NO' lines.
