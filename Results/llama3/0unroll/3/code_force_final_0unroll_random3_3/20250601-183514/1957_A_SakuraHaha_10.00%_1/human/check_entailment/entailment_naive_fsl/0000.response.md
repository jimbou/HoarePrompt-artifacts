Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
1 1 1

The program will output 0, but the correct output should be 1, because we can form an equilateral triangle with the three sticks of length 1.

The issue with the program is that it only considers the case where we can form a square with 4 sticks of the same length, but it does not consider the case where we can form other regular polygons with a different number of sides. In this case, we can form an equilateral triangle with 3 sticks of the same length, but the program does not account for this possibility.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to consider all possible regular polygons that can be formed with the given sticks, not just squares.
