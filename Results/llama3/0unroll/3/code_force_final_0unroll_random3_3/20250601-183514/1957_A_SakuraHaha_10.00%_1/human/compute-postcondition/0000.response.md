Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, ans is 0, cnt is an empty dictionary**.

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The second line reads a list of `n` integers from stdin and assigns it to `a`. The third line initializes `ans` to 0, and the fourth line initializes `cnt` as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected.
