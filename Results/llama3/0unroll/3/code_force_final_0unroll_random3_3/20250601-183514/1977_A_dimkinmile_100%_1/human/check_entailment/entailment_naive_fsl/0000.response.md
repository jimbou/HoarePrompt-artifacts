Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even and non-negative. This is because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must be even. Additionally, the number of moves must be greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes, since Nikita cannot remove more cubes than he has added.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, when the number of moves is greater than the desired number of cubes, and when the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. The program also correctly handles cases where the desired number of cubes is 0, since in this case the number of moves must be even.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
