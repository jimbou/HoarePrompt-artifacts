Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative. This is a correct approach because:

* If the difference is even, it means that the number of cubes added and removed can be paired up, resulting in a net change of 0 or an even number of cubes.
* If the difference is non-negative, it means that the number of cubes added is greater than or equal to the number of cubes removed, resulting in a non-negative number of cubes in the tower.

The program correctly prints 'Yes' if the difference is even and non-negative, and 'No' otherwise.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1()` is not defined anywhere in the code. It seems that the function is supposed to contain the logic for reading the input and checking the condition. But since the function is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError`.

Correctness: **False** (due to the undefined function `func_1()`)
