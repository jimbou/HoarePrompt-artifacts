Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where in each move, either one cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.

However, the program's logic is incorrect. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` does not accurately represent the problem's requirements. This condition checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, but it does not consider the actual moves required to build the tower.

For example, in the second test case, `n = 2` and `m = 4`. The program outputs "No" because the difference `n - m = -2` is negative. However, it is actually possible to build a tower with 4 cubes in 2 moves by adding 2 cubes in the first move and then adding 2 more cubes in the second move.

Therefore, the program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
