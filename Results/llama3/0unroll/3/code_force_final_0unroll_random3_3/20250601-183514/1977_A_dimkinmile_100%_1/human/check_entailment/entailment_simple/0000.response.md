Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where in each move, either one cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The given program correctly solves this problem by checking if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. This is because the number of moves `n` must be sufficient to add or remove cubes to reach the desired height `m`. If the difference is even, it means that the number of moves is sufficient to add or remove cubes in pairs, resulting in a tower with an even number of cubes. If the difference is non-negative, it means that the number of moves is sufficient to add cubes to reach the desired height.

The program correctly prints "Yes" if the difference is even and non-negative, and "No" otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
