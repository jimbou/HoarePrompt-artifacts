Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

2. The given program defines a function `func_1()` that takes the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` as input.

3. The function checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. This is because Nikita can only add or remove cubes in pairs to end up with an even number of cubes.

4. If the difference is even and non-negative, the function prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

5. Otherwise, the function prints 'No', indicating that it's not possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

6. The program then reads the number of test cases `kreker` and calls the `func_1()` function for each test case.

7. However, the program is missing the call to `func_1()` inside the loop. It should be `for i in range(kreker): func_1()`.

8. Despite this mistake, the logic of the program is correct. It correctly checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for it to be possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves.

Correctness: **True**
