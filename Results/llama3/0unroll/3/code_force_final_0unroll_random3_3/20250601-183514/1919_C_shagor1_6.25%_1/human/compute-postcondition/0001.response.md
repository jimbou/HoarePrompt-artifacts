Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list to determine the number of times the maximum value (y) needs to be updated when encountering a number greater than both the current maximum (x) and the current second maximum (y). The function prints the count of such updates for each test case.**
