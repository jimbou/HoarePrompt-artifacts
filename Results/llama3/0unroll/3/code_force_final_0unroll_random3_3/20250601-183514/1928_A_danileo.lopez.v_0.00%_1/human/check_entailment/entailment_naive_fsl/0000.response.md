Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a and b are both odd numbers greater than 1. For example, if a = 3 and b = 5, the program will print 'No', but it is possible to cut the rectangle into two 3x2 rectangles and then form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x5 rectangle.

The program only checks if a or b is even, but it does not consider the case when both a and b are odd. It should also check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1, because if the GCD is greater than 1, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and then these two rectangles can be used to form a different rectangle.
