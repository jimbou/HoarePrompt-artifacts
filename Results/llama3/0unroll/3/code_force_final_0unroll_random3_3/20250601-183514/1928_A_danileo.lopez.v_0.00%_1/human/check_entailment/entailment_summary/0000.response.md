Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem statement requires determining if a rectangle of size a x b can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then reformed into a different rectangle. The key insight is that if either a or b is even, the rectangle can be cut into two equal halves, which can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if either a or b is even (i.e., a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0). If either condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that a different rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
