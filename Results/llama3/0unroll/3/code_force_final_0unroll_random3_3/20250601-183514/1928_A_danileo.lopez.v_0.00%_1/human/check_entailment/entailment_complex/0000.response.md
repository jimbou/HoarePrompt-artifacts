Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if at least one of the dimensions (a or b) is even, which is a necessary condition for Bob to be able to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form another rectangle.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if a rectangle has at least one even dimension, it can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. For example, if a rectangle has dimensions 2x6, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be used to form a 4x3 rectangle. On the other hand, if both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

The program's implementation is also correct. It reads the input pairs of integers, checks if at least one of the integers is even, and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. The program does not modify the input values or return any values, only producing output based on the input pairs.

Correctness: **True**
