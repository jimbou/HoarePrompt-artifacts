The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the first line of stdin and assigns it to `t`. The value of `t` is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state. The remaining lines in stdin contain two integers each, but they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two integers.**
