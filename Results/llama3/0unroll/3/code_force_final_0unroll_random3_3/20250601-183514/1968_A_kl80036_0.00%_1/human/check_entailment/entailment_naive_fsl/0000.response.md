Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs 3, but the correct output should be 4 or 5 because gcd(6, 4) + 4 = 6 and gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 6, which is greater than gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 4.

The program only checks the case where y is half of x, but it does not consider other possible values of y that could result in a larger gcd(x, y) + y.
