The function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be in a specific format, where the first line contains a positive integer t, followed by t lines, each containing a positive integer n and a list of n integers between 1 and n (inclusive), with each integer appearing at most twice in the list. The function then calls another function, func_1, with the input n and list a, and appends the result to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result in the list. The function does not modify the input data or any external state, and its output is solely based on the input provided.
