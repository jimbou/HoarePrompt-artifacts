Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, given the cards in their hand and the optimal play of their opponent.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes the number of cards `n` and the list of cards in the player's hand `a` as input. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each card in the hand. Then, it calculates the number of pairs of cards with the same number by summing up the counts that are equal to 2. Finally, it returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which represents the maximum number of points the player can score.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

The reasoning behind the correctness of the program is as follows:

* The `Counter` class correctly counts the frequency of each card in the hand.
* The calculation of the number of pairs of cards with the same number is correct.
* The return statement in `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points the player can score, taking into account the optimal play of the opponent.
* The input parsing and output printing in `func_2` are correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
