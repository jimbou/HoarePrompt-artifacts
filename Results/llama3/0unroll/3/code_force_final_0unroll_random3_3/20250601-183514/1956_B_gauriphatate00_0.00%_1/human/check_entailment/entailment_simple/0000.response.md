Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game by taking turns optimally. The game involves two players, each with n cards, and the objective is to maximize the score by selecting cards that match the numbers already on the table.

Function 1 calculates the maximum number of points a player can score by counting the number of pairs of identical numbers in their hand and returning the minimum value between this count and half of the total number of cards (n // 2). This approach is correct because a player can only score points by selecting a card that matches a number already on the table, and the maximum number of such matches is limited by the number of pairs in their hand.

Function 2 reads input data from the standard input, processes it, and calls Function 1 for each test case. It then prints the results. The input data is processed correctly, and the function calls are made with the correct arguments.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
