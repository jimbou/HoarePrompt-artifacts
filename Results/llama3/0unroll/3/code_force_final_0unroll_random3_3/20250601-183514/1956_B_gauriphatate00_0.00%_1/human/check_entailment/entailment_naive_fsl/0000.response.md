Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game. The game involves two players, each with n cards, and the objective is to maximize the score by playing cards strategically.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two inputs, `n` and `a`, where `n` is the number of cards each player has, and `a` is the list of integers on the cards in the player's hand. The function uses a Counter from the collections module to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then calculates the number of pairs of cards with the same integer by summing up the counts that are equal to 2. Finally, it returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which represents the maximum number of points the player can score.

`func_2` is the main function that reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list `a`. It then calls `func_1` with `n` and `a` as inputs and appends the result to the list `results`. Finally, it prints each result in the list.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of points a player can score in the card game. It handles all possible cases, including when there are no pairs of cards with the same integer, when there are pairs but not enough to fill the table, and when there are enough pairs to fill the table. The program also correctly handles the case when `n` is 1, in which case the player can score 0 points.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
