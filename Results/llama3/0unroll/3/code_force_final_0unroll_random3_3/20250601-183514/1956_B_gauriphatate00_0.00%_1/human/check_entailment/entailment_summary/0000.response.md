Reasoning: 
The problem requires determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game by taking turns optimally. The game involves two players, each with n cards, and the objective is to maximize the score by selecting cards that will result in points.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the minimum value between the number of integers that appear exactly twice in a given list and half of a given positive integer. This function is used to determine the maximum number of points a player can score.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be in a specific format and calls `func_1` with the input n and list a to calculate the maximum number of points.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points a player can score, and `func_2` correctly reads and processes the input to produce the desired output.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
