Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Function 1 correctly calculates the minimum value between the number of integers that appear exactly twice in a given list and half of a given positive integer. This is because the number of pairs of identical integers in the list is the maximum number of points that can be scored by selecting the cards optimally. However, since Nene also plays optimally, the maximum number of points that can be scored is limited by the number of turns, which is n/2.

Function 2 correctly reads the input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be in the correct format and calls Function 1 with the correct arguments.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem by calculating the maximum number of points that can be scored by selecting the cards optimally, taking into account the optimal play of Nene.

Correctness: **True**
