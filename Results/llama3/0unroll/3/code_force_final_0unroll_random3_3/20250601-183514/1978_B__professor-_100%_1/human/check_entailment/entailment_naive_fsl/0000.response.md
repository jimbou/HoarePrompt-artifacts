Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program considers three cases:

1. If the modified price (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price, resulting in a profit of n * a.

2. If the difference between the modified price (b) and the usual price (a) is greater than or equal to the number of buns (n), it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: (2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program calculates the profit by selling the first (b - a) buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price. The profit is calculated as the sum of the arithmetic series for the modified price and the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the maximum profit accordingly.
