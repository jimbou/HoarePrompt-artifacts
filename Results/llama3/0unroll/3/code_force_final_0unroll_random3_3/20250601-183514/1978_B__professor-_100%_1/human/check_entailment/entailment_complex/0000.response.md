Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the three cases described in the problem:

    *   When `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the maximum profit is obtained by selling all `n` buns at the usual price `a`. The program correctly calculates this as `n * a`.
    *   When `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the maximum profit is obtained by selling the first `n` buns at the modified price. The program correctly calculates this using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
    *   When `b - a` is less than `n`, the maximum profit is obtained by selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`. The program correctly calculates this as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.
2.  The program uses the correct data types and operations to handle the large input values (up to 10^9).
3.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin and writes the output to stdout.

Correctness: **True**
