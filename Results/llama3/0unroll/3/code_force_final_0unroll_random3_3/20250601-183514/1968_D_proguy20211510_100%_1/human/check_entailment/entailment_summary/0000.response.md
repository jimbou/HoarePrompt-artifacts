Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the maximum value of the calculated scores 'resb' and 'ress'. The program iterates over multiple test cases, processes the input arrays 'p' and 'a', and outputs the correct result based on the given conditions. The program does not have any syntax errors, logical errors, or incorrect assumptions about the input data. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
