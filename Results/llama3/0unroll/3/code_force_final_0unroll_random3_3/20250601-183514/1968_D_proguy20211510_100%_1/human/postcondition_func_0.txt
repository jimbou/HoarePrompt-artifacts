This function determines the winner of a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the maximum value of two calculated scores, 'resb' and 'ress', which are derived from the input arrays 'p' and 'a' and the given conditions. The function iterates over multiple test cases, each containing four lines of input, and outputs a string indicating the winner ('Bodya' or 'Sasha') or a 'Draw' if the scores are equal. The function does not modify the input arrays or any external state, and its output is solely based on the provided input.
