Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem. The program correctly reads the input, constructs the permutation and array, and calculates the maximum score for both Bodya and Sasha.

The program uses a clever approach to calculate the maximum score by iterating over the path of each player and keeping track of the maximum score that can be achieved at each position. This approach ensures that the program can handle large values of k efficiently.

The program also correctly handles the case where the game ends in a draw by comparing the maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha.

However, there are a few minor issues with the program:

1. The program uses unnecessary variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` which are not used anywhere in the program. These variables can be removed to make the program more concise.

2. The program does not handle invalid inputs. For example, if the input permutation is not a valid permutation (i.e., it contains duplicate elements or elements outside the range [1, n]), the program will produce incorrect results. Similarly, if the input array contains elements outside the range [1, 10^9], the program will produce incorrect results.

3. The program does not handle the case where k is 0. In this case, the program will produce incorrect results because it does not handle the case where the game ends immediately.

Despite these minor issues, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
