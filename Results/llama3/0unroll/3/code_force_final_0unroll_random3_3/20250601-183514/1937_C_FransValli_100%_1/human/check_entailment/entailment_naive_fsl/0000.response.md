Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the interactive problem described. It finds two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`.

The program works as follows:

1. It first finds the index `maxi` such that `p_maxi` is the maximum among all `p_i`. This is done by comparing `p_i` with `p_maxi` for each `i` and updating `maxi` if `p_i` is greater.

2. Then, it finds all indices `i` such that `p_i` is equal to `p_maxi`. This is done by comparing `p_maxi` with `p_i` for each `i` and adding `i` to the list `arr` if they are equal.

3. Finally, it finds the index `mini` such that `p_mini` is the minimum among all `p_i` in `arr`. This is done by comparing `p_mini` with `p_i` for each `i` in `arr` and updating `mini` if `p_i` is less.

The program then prints `! maxi mini`, which means it has found the pair of indices `maxi` and `mini` such that `p_maxi ⊕ p_mini` is maximized.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the limit specified in the problem description.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly finds the pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, and it does so within the specified query limit. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
