Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding any two indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized, where ^ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. 

The program first finds the index of the maximum value in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the indices of the elements that have the same maximum value as the maximum element found earlier. 

Next, it finds the index of the minimum value among the elements that have the same maximum value as the maximum element. This is done by comparing each element with the current minimum. 

Finally, it prints the indices of the maximum and minimum values found, which are the indices i and j such that p_i ^ p_j is maximized.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, by finding any one of them.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
