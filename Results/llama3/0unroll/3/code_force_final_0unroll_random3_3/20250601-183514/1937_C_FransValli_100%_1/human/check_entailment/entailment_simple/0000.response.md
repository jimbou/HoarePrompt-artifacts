Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index `maxi` of the maximum value in the permutation `p`. It does this by comparing each element with the current maximum element using the query `? maxi maxi i i`. If the result is `<`, it means that `p[i]` is greater than `p[maxi]`, so it updates `maxi` to `i`. This process is repeated for all elements in the permutation.

2. After finding the maximum element, the program finds all elements that have the same maximum value as `p[maxi]`. It does this by comparing each element with `p[maxi]` using the query `? maxi arr[0] maxi i`. If the result is `=`, it means that `p[i]` has the same maximum value as `p[maxi]`, so it adds `i` to the list `arr`.

3. The program then finds the index `mini` of the minimum value in the list `arr`. It does this by comparing each element in `arr` with the current minimum element using the query `? mini mini item item`. If the result is `>`, it means that `p[item]` is less than `p[mini]`, so it updates `mini` to `item`.

4. Finally, the program prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the maximum and minimum values of the permutation.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted and the program handles the results of the queries correctly.

Correctness: **True**
