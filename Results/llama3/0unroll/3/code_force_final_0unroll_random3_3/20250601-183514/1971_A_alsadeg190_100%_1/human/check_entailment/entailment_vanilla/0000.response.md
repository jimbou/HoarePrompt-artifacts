Reasoning:

1. The problem statement asks to output the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y.
2. The given program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
3. Inside the function, it reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
4. The program then iterates `x` times, reading two integers `x` and `y` from the input in each iteration.
5. For each pair of `x` and `y`, the program checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` and `y` in that order. Otherwise, it prints `y` and `x` in that order.
6. The program does not use any external variables or data structures, and it only uses the input data to produce the output.

Based on the above steps, the program correctly implements the required logic to output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
