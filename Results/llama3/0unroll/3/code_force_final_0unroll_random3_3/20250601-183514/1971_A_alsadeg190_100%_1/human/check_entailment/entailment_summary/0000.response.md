Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. The program reads an integer t, which represents the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads two space-separated integers x and y.

The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine whether x is less than y. If x is less than y, it prints the original values of x and y, which are already in the correct order (minimum followed by maximum). If x is greater than or equal to y, it prints the swapped values of x and y, which ensures that the minimum value is printed first, followed by the maximum value.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the input correctly and printing the minimum and maximum values in the correct order.

Correctness: **True**
