Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers x and y. It then compares x and y, and prints the smaller one followed by the larger one. This meets the requirements of the problem description. The program handles all possible cases, including when x and y are equal, and when x is less than, greater than, or equal to y. The program also handles the case when x and y are both 0, which is a valid input according to the problem description.
