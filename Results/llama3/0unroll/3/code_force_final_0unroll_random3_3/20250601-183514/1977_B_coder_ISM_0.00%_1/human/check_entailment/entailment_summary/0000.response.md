Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find a valid array of integers that satisfies the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, it reads a positive integer (x).
2. It converts the integer x to its binary representation using the bitwise AND operator (&) and the pow function.
3. It then performs a series of operations on the binary representation to ensure that there are no consecutive 1's. This is done by iterating through the binary representation from left to right and flipping bits as necessary.
4. After the operations, it prints the length of the modified binary representation and the representation itself.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of bitwise operations and the pow function is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
