Functionality: **This function reads a number of test cases (t) from standard input, then for each test case, it reads a positive integer (x) and converts it to its binary representation. It then performs a series of operations on the binary representation, including flipping bits and appending new bits, and finally prints the length of the modified binary representation and the representation itself. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the results for each test case.**
