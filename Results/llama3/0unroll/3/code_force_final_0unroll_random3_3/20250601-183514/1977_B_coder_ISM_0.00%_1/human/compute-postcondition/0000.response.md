The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases. This integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one line. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line.**
