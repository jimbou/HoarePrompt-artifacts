Functionality: **Calculates and prints the maximum of two possible values for each input line, where the values are determined by the number of items (n), the cost of item A (a), and the cost of item B (b). For each input line, the function prints the maximum of a*n and n//2*b, taking into account whether n is odd or even. The function processes multiple input lines and prints the result for each line separately.**
