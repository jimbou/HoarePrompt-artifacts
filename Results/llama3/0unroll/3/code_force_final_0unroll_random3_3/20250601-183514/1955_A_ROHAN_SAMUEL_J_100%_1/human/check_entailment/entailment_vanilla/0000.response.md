Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b) as inputs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, a, and b from the input.

3. If n is odd (i.e., n % 2 is True), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost as n * a (since buying each yogurt at the regular price is cheaper). Otherwise, it prints the total cost as (n // 2) * b + a (since buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price is cheaper).

4. If n is even (i.e., n % 2 is False), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost as n * a (since buying each yogurt at the regular price is cheaper). Otherwise, it prints the total cost as (n // 2) * b (since buying all yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper).

The program's logic correctly handles all possible scenarios based on the values of n, a, and b. It correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka" based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
