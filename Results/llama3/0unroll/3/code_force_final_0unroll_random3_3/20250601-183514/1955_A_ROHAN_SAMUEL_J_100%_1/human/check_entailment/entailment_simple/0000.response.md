Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

The program then checks if the number of yogurts is odd (n % 2). If it is, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost as the product of the number of yogurts and the price for one yogurt (a * n). Otherwise, the program prints the total cost as the sum of the cost of buying n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b) and the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price (a).

If the number of yogurts is even (n % 2 == 0), the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program prints the total cost as the product of the number of yogurts and the price for one yogurt (a * n). Otherwise, the program prints the total cost as the product of the number of pairs of yogurts (n // 2) and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. It correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts based on the prices of one yogurt and two yogurts on promotion.

Correctness: **True**
