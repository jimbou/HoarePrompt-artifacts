Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: when n is odd and when n is even. When n is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it buys n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b) and one yogurt at the regular price (a). When n is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it buys n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b).

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when n is odd or even, and when 2 * a is less than or greater than b. It also correctly calculates the minimum cost in each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
