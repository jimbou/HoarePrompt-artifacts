Output State: **The output state will be a series of strings, each representing the output for a test case. Each string will consist of lowercase English letters, where the frequency of each letter is determined by the input array. Specifically, for each input array, the output string will have the same length as the array, and the i-th character of the string will be the (array[i]+1)-th letter of the alphabet (where 'a' is the 1st letter, 'b' is the 2nd letter, and so on). The strings will be separated by newline characters.**
