You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ans = ''
        
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of strings, each representing the output for a test case. Each string will consist of lowercase English letters, where the frequency of each letter is determined by the input array. Specifically, for each input array, the output string will have the same length as the array, and the i-th character of the string will be the (array[i]+1)-th letter of the alphabet (where 'a' is the 1st letter, 'b' is the 2nd letter, and so on). The strings will be separated by newline characters.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
