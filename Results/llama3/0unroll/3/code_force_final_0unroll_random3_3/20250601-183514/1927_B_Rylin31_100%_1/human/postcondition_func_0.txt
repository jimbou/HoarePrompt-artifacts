The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n space-separated integers. It then generates a string for each test case, where the i-th character of the string corresponds to the (array[i]+1)-th letter of the alphabet, with the frequency of each letter determined by the input array. The function prints each generated string on a new line, resulting in a series of strings as output.
