Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of friends `n` and their best friends `p_i`, and checks if any of the friends `p_i` is equal to the friend at index `p_i - 1` in the list. If such a condition is met, it prints 2, indicating that at least 2 friends can come to the party with 2 invitations. If no such condition is met, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed for at least 2 friends to come to the party.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2, in which case it prints 2, as both friends can come to the party with 2 invitations.

The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior, and the output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
