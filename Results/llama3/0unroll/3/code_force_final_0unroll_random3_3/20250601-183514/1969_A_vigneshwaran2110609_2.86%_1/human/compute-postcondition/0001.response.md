Output State: **The output state will be the input state with the variable `n` decremented by 1, and the rest of the test cases (t-1 test cases) and the integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n for the current test case consumed from stdin. The output will contain either 2 or 3 for each test case, depending on whether the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met.**
