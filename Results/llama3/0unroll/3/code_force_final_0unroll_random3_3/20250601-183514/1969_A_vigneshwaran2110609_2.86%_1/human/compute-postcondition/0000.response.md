Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains the rest of the test cases (t-1 test cases) and the integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n for the current test case.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the rest of the test cases (t-1 test cases) and the integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n for the current test case.
