This function reads input from stdin, processes test cases, and outputs a result for each case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n and n distinct integers. The function checks if any of the integers p_i is equal to the integer at index p_i - 1 in the list. If such a condition is met, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function consumes the input for the current test case and the remaining test cases (t-1 test cases) from stdin, leaving the input state with the variable `n` decremented by 1.
