Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of friends `x` and their best friends `l`. It then checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends by checking if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` for any `i`. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed to get at least 2 friends to the party. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the number of friends `x` and their best friends `l`. It prints the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases. For example, if there are only 2 friends, it will correctly print 2, because only 2 invitations are needed to get both friends to the party.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
