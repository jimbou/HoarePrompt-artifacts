Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques required, which is the ceiling of `n` divided by `k`. It then initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers, respectively. The function calls `make_array` to populate these lists.

Function `make_array` assigns consecutive integers to specific ranges in `arr` and a repeated clique value to corresponding ranges in `cliquess`. The assignment is done in a way that minimizes the number of cliques required.

The program's output consists of the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic. The use of `ceil(n / k)` to calculate the number of cliques ensures that the graph is partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The `make_array` function assigns integers and clique numbers in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
