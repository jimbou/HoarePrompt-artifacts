Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: arr is a list of n integers, where the first k elements are 1, the next k elements are 2, and so on, until the last k elements are cliques, and cliquess is a list of n integers, where the first k elements are 1, the next k elements are 2, and so on, until the last k elements are cliques.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: a sequence of k repetitions of each integer from 1 to cliques
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: A list of n integers, where the first k elements are 1, the next k elements are 2, and so on, until the last k elements are [cliques] (where [cliques] is the value of the last set of k elements)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 1 (k times), 2 (k times), 3 (k times), ..., cliques (k times)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each containing a sequence of integers. The sequence consists of `k` repetitions of each integer from 1 to `cliques`, where `cliques` is the ceiling of `n` divided by `k`. The function then prints the contents of `arr`, the value of `cliques`, and the contents of `cliquess`. The final state of the program is that these printed values are displayed, with no modifications made to the input variables `n` and `k`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1.
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2), arr[left: left + mid] is a list of consecutive integers from small_element to small_element + mid - 1, and cliquess[left: left + mid] is a list of clique repeated mid times.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2), arr[left: left + mid] is a list of consecutive integers from small_element to small_element + mid - 1, cliquess[left: left + mid] is a list of clique repeated mid times, and arr[left + mid: right + 1] is a list of consecutive integers from big_element - not_mid + 1 to big_element, and cliquess[left + mid: right + 1] is a list of clique repeated not_mid times.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function modifies two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, by assigning consecutive integers and a repeated clique value to specific ranges within these lists. It takes in parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left < right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function divides the range from `left` to `right` into two parts, assigning smaller consecutive integers to the first part and larger consecutive integers to the second part of the range in `arr`, while assigning the `clique` value to corresponding parts in `cliquess`. The function returns no value but modifies the input lists `arr` and `cliquess` in place.
