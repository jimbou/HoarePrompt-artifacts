Output State: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2), arr[left: left + mid] is a list of consecutive integers from small_element to small_element + mid - 1, cliquess[left: left + mid] is a list of clique repeated mid times, arr[left + mid: right + 1] is a list of consecutive integers from big_element - not_mid + 1 to big_element, and cliquess[left + mid: right + 1] is a list of clique repeated not_mid times.
