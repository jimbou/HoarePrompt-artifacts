Functionality: This function takes in a range defined by two non-negative integers `left` and `right` where `left` is less than `right`, a positive integer `clique`, and two lists `arr` and `cliquess` of length at least `right + 1`. It modifies the elements in `arr` and `cliquess` within the specified range. Specifically, it assigns consecutive integers starting from `left + 1` to the first half of the range in `arr` and assigns `clique` to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`. Then, it assigns consecutive integers counting down from `right + 1` to the second half of the range in `arr` and assigns `clique` to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`. The function does not return any value but modifies the input lists in place.
