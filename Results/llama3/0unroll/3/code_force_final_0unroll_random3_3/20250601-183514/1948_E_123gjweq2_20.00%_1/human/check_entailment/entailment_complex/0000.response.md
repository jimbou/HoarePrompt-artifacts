Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required to partition the graph and initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers, respectively. It then calls the `make_array` function to populate these lists.

The `make_array` function takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` lists by assigning consecutive integers and a repeated clique value to specific ranges within these lists.

The program's correctness can be evaluated by analyzing its logic and the problem constraints. The program's approach is to divide the range of vertices into smaller sub-ranges and assign consecutive integers to each sub-range. This ensures that the assigned integers are distinct and that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.

The program's use of the `ceil` function to calculate the number of cliques ensures that the graph is partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques, even when the number of vertices is not exactly divisible by the clique size.

The `make_array` function's logic for assigning consecutive integers and clique values to the `arr` and `cliquess` lists, respectively, is correct and ensures that the assigned integers are distinct and that each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

Overall, the program's logic and implementation are correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
