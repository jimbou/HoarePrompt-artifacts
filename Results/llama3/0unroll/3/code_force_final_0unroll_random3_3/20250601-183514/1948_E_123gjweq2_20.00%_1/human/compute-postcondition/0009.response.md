Functionality: **The function generates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each containing a sequence of integers. The sequence consists of `k` repetitions of each integer from 1 to `cliques`, where `cliques` is the ceiling of `n` divided by `k`. The function then prints the contents of `arr`, the value of `cliques`, and the contents of `cliquess`. The final state of the program is that these printed values are displayed, with no modifications made to the input variables `n` and `k`.**
