Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is designed to assign distinct integers to each vertex in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. The program uses a greedy approach to assign the integers, starting from the smallest possible value and incrementing it for each clique.

The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required based on the input values `n` and `k`. It then initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers, respectively.

The `make_array` function is used to assign integers to the vertices in each clique. It takes three parameters: `left` and `right`, which represent the range of vertices in the clique, and `clique`, which is the clique number. The function assigns the smallest possible integers to the vertices in the clique, starting from `left + 1` and incrementing it for each vertex. The `cliquess` array is updated accordingly.

The program then prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly assigns distinct integers to each vertex and partitions the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques. The `make_array` function ensures that the integers are assigned in a way that minimizes the number of cliques required.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
