Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2).**

In this final state, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The new variables `small_element` and `big_element` are assigned the values of `left + 1` and `right + 1`, respectively. The variable `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the difference between `big_element` and `small_element` by 2, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The variable `not_mid` is then calculated as the total range (`right - left + 1`) minus the value of `mid`.
