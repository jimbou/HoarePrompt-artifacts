Functionality: **This function modifies two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, by assigning consecutive integers and a repeated clique value to specific ranges within these lists. It takes in parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left < right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function divides the range from `left` to `right` into two parts, assigning smaller consecutive integers to the first part and larger consecutive integers to the second part of the range in `arr`, while assigning the `clique` value to corresponding parts in `cliquess`. The function returns no value but modifies the input lists `arr` and `cliquess` in place.**
