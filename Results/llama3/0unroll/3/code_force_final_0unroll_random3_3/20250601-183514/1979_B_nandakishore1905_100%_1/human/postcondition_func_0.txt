This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers. For each pair of integers, it calculates the absolute difference and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to this difference. If the difference is a power of 2, it prints the difference as is. If the difference is odd, it prints 1. The function outputs a single integer for each test case, resulting in a total of t lines of output.
