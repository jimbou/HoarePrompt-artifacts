Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The given program calculates the sum of the weighted values of the four integers p_i for each test case, where the weight is 3 for the first two integers and 1 for the last two integers, and then divides the sum by 3.

The reasoning behind this calculation is as follows:

* For the first two integers (ones and twos), each occurrence of these numbers can be paired with another occurrence of the same number to produce a bitwise XOR of 0, which means Bob wins. Therefore, the weight for these integers is 3, representing the maximum number of times Bob can win for each pair of these numbers.
* For the last two integers (threes and fours), each occurrence of these numbers can be paired with an occurrence of the other number to produce a bitwise XOR of 0, which means Bob wins. Therefore, the weight for these integers is 1, representing the maximum number of times Bob can win for each pair of these numbers.

By summing up the weighted values of the four integers and dividing by 3, the program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
