Output: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and this is printed: The sum of 3 times the integer division of each p_i by 2 plus the remainder of the division of each p_i by 2 if the index of p_i is less than 3, for each line of four integers, divided by 3, for t lines.**
