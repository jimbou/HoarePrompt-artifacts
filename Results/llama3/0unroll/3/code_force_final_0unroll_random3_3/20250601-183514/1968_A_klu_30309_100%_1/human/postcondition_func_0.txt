This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` as input, where each integer in `test_cases` is between 2 and 1000, and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is the largest `y` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` is maximized, and `y` is less than `x`, corresponding to each `x` in `test_cases`. The function does not modify the input variables `t` and `test_cases`.
