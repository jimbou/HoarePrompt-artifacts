Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs 3, but the correct output should be 5 because gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 6, which is greater than gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 4.

The issue with the program is that it breaks the loop as soon as it finds a y that gives a greater sum than the current max_sum. However, this does not guarantee that it has found the maximum possible sum. It should continue checking all possible values of y to ensure that it finds the maximum possible sum.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

In this corrected code, the loop continues to check all possible values of y, ensuring that it finds the maximum possible sum.
