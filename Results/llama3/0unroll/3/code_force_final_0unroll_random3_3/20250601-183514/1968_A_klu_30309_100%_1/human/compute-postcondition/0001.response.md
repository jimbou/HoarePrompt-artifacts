Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list of integers where each integer is the largest number less than the corresponding number in `test_cases` that has a greatest common divisor with the corresponding number in `test_cases` greater than the number itself.
