    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for all x in `test_cases` and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, `results` is a list of integers such that for each x in `test_cases`, the corresponding element in `results` is the largest y such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximized and y < x.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the largest y such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximized and y < x, corresponding to each x in the list `test_cases` which contains integers between 2 and 1000, and the length of `test_cases` is equal to the positive integer `t`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases` as input, where each integer in `test_cases` is between 2 and 1000, and the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is the largest `y` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` and `y` is maximized, and `y` is less than `x`, corresponding to each `x` in `test_cases`. The function does not modify the input variables `t` and `test_cases`.
