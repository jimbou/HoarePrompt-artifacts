Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is the largest y such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximized and y < x, corresponding to each x in the list `test_cases` which contains integers between 2 and 1000, and the length of `test_cases` is equal to the positive integer `t`.**
