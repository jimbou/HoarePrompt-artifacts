Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the tree has a node with an even number of children, and the stone is initially placed on that node. In this case, the program will incorrectly determine the winner of the game.

The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. However, it does not take into account the number of children each node has. As a result, the program will incorrectly determine the winner of the game when the stone is initially placed on a node with an even number of children.

For example, consider a tree with 5 nodes, where node 1 has 2 children (nodes 2 and 3), node 2 has 1 child (node 4), and node 3 has 1 child (node 5). If the stone is initially placed on node 1, the program will incorrectly determine that Ron wins the game, when in fact Hermione wins.

To fix this issue, the program needs to take into account the number of children each node has when calculating the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
