Output State: **The leaves deque contains all the nodes with only one neighbor, start is an integer equal to the first input, moves is a value returned by func_1(nodes, start), the rest of the variables remain unchanged.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `start`. The second line assigns the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)` to `moves`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
