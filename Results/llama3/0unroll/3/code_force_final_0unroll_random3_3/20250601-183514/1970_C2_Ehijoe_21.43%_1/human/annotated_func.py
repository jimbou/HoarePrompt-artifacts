    #State: *nodes is a list of lists of integers representing a tree, start is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start < len(nodes), and parent is either None or a non-negative integer such that 0 <= parent < len(nodes).

    #State: Output State: The list distances contains all the distances from the start node to all other nodes in the tree that are not the parent of the start node, where the distance is calculated by recursively calling func_1 on each child node of the start node and adding 1 to each distance returned.

    #The program returns a list of distances from the start node to all other nodes in the tree that are not the parent of the start node, where each distance is calculated by recursively calling func_1 on each child node of the start node and adding 1 to each distance returned.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the distances from a specified start node to all other nodes in a tree, excluding the parent node. It takes a tree represented as a list of lists of integers, a start node index, and a parent node index as input. If the start node has only one child and that child is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single element, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances to all other nodes by calling another function, func_1, on each child node of the start node and adding 1 to each returned distance. The function returns a list of these calculated distances.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, start is an integer representing the starting node.
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, start is an integer representing the starting node, n and t are integers, edges is an empty list, empty is True
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
        
    #State: Output State: The leaves deque contains all the nodes with only one neighbor, the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *The leaves deque contains all the nodes with only one neighbor, start is an integer equal to the first input, moves is a value returned by func_1(nodes, start), the rest of the variables remain unchanged. If the current value of moves contains at least one odd number, 'Ron' is being printed. Otherwise, all elements in moves are even, and 'Hermione' is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given tree structure, represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighbors, has a path that can be traversed in an odd number of moves. It takes no parameters but reads input from the user, including the number of nodes, edges, and a starting node. The function then identifies the leaves of the tree (nodes with only one neighbor) and uses a separate function, func_1, to determine the moves required to traverse the tree. If any of these moves are odd, the function prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any values but modifies the program state by printing a result based on the tree structure and moves.
