Postcondition: ***The leaves deque contains all the nodes with only one neighbor, start is an integer equal to the first input, moves is a value returned by func_1(nodes, start), the rest of the variables remain unchanged. If the current value of moves contains at least one odd number, 'Ron' is being printed. Otherwise, all elements in moves are even, and 'Hermione' is being printed.***
