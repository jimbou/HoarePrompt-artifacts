This function calculates and returns the distances from a specified start node to all other nodes in a tree, excluding the parent node. It takes a tree represented as a list of lists of integers, a start node index, and a parent node index as input. If the start node has only one child and that child is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single element, 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances to all other nodes by calling another function, func_1, on each child node of the start node and adding 1 to each returned distance. The function returns a list of these calculated distances.
