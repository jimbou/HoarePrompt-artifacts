Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input data for each test case, including the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`pos_final`), and the two lists of costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`).
2.  It initializes variables to keep track of the total cost (`total`) and the best (minimum) cost found so far (`best`).
3.  The program then iterates over the positions in the queue from the end to the beginning (using `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`).
4.  For each position `v`, it checks if `v` is within the desired final position range (`v <= pos_final`). If it is, the program updates the `best` cost if a better (lower) cost is found by adding the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) to the current total cost.
5.  Regardless of whether `v` is within the desired range, the program updates the `total` cost by adding the minimum of the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) and the cost to pass the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).
6.  After iterating over all positions, the program prints the minimum cost found (`best`) for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program produces the correct output for the provided example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
