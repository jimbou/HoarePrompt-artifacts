This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines of input. It then calculates the minimum cost to reach a final position from an initial position, considering two different costs for each position. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case. The output is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum cost for a test case.
