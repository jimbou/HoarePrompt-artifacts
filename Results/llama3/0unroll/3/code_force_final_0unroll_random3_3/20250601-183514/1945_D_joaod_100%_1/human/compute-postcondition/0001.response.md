Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum cost to reach the final position from the initial position in each test case. The list has a length equal to the number of test cases (cases). The values in the list are the results of the print statements inside the loop, which are the minimum costs calculated for each test case. The state of the other variables (cases, stdin, na_frente, pos_final, custo_pra_trocar_a, custo_pra_passar_b, total, and best) remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.**
