The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines of input. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, where 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. The second and third lines contain n space-separated integers each. Since the first line of the input is consumed by the code, the stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one line of input. 

Output State: **`cases` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line of input. Each test case consists of three lines of input. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, where 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. The second and third lines contain n space-separated integers each.**
