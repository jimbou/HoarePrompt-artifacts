#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer, a, b, and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b).
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the calculated answer is less than or equal to the product of the total number of items (n) and the maximum of the two values (a and b).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates a weighted sum of two values (a and b) based on a given proportion (k) and checks if the result is within a certain limit (n * max(a, b)). It takes four non-negative integers (k, a, b, and n) as input, where k is within the range of 0 to the minimum of n and b. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the calculated sum is less than or equal to the specified limit.
