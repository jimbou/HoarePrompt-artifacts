Functionality: **This function calculates a weighted sum of two values (a and b) based on a given proportion (k) and checks if the result is within a certain limit (n * max(a, b)). It takes four non-negative integers (k, a, b, and n) as input, where k is within the range of 0 to the minimum of n and b. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the calculated sum is less than or equal to the specified limit.**
