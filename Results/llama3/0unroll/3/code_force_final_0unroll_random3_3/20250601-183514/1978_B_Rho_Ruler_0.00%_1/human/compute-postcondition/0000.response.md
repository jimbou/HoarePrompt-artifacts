The code calculates the value of `ans` by adding two products: the product of `k` and `b`, and the product of `n - k` and `a`. Since `k` is an integer and `a`, `b`, and `n` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= k <= min(n, b)`, the value of `ans` will be a non-negative integer.

Output State: **ans is a non-negative integer equal to k * b + (n - k) * a, k is an integer, a, b, and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b)**
