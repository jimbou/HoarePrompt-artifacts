Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the calculated answer is less than or equal to the product of the total number of items (n) and the maximum of the two values (a and b).**

In this output state, the calculated answer (ans) is a non-negative integer equal to k * b + (n - k) * a, where k is an integer, and a, b, and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b). The program returns a boolean value (True or False) indicating whether this calculated answer is less than or equal to the product of the total number of items (n) and the maximum of the two values (a and b).
