Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic to determine the maximum profit. The function is returning `True` if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct condition to determine the maximum profit.

The correct condition should be to calculate the profit for the current value of `k` and compare it with the maximum profit found so far. If the current profit is greater than the maximum profit, then update the maximum profit and the value of `k`.

Also, the binary search approach used in the program is not necessary to solve this problem. A simple loop to iterate over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n` would be sufficient to find the maximum profit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = 0
            for i in range(1, k + 1):
                profit += (b - i + 1)
            profit += (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum profit by iterating over all possible values of `k` and calculating the profit for each value. It then prints the maximum profit found.
