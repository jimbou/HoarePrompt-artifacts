#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a function
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns a variable named 'wrapper' that is not defined in the initial state, and no information is available about its value or type.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns a variable named 'wrapper' without modifying the input dictionary 'd'. The value and type of 'wrapper' are undefined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of values of any type and d is a dictionary.
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: *`args` is a tuple of values of any type and `d` is a dictionary. If `args` is not a key in `d`, then `d` is updated with `args` as a key and the result of calling `func` with `args` as arguments as the value. Otherwise, `d` remains unchanged.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the value associated with the key `args` in the dictionary `d`, which is either the result of calling `func` with `args` as arguments if `args` was not a key in `d` initially, or the existing value associated with `args` in `d` if `args` was already a key in `d`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function retrieves or computes and stores the result of calling `func` with `args` as arguments, and returns the result. If `args` is already a key in the dictionary `d`, it returns the existing value associated with `args`. If `args` is not a key in `d`, it computes the result of calling `func` with `args` as arguments, stores it in `d` with `args` as the key, and returns the result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined as the function does not have any parameters.
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the first line of input from the standard input, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the first line of input from the standard input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_2() returns a string that represents an integer
    return int(func_2())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_2()

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_2() to an integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string.
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the delimiter string and then converting each resulting substring to an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a delimiter string as input, splits a string returned by another function (`func_2()`) into substrings using the delimiter, converts each substring to an integer, and returns the resulting list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined from this function as it does not have any parameters.
    return func_2()
    #The program returns the value returned by the function func_2()

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calls another function named func_2 and returns the value returned by func_2. It does not perform any other actions or modify any input variables, as it does not accept any parameters. The purpose of this function is to delegate its execution to func_2 and return the result.

    #State: The maximum difference between consecutive elements in list A is updated to be the minimum of the current maximum difference and the maximum difference found in the current iteration of the loop, which is the maximum of the difference between the left element and the current element in list D plus the current value of f, and the difference between the current element in list D plus the current value of f and the right element. The index, next_max_diff, left, and right variables remain unchanged.
    print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
    #This is printed: the maximum of ans and next_max_diff (where ans is the current answer and next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between consecutive elements in list A)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list A, and then iteratively updates this maximum difference by considering the minimum difference between elements in list A and elements in a sorted list D, offset by values in list F. The function returns the maximum of the updated maximum difference and the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in list A.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: testcases is a non-negative integer
    testcases = func_3()
    for _ in range(testcases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: The value of testcases is returned by the function func_3() and the function func_6() has been executed testcases times.

#Overall this is what the function does:Executes the function func_6() a number of times equal to the value returned by func_3(), which is expected to be a non-negative integer.
