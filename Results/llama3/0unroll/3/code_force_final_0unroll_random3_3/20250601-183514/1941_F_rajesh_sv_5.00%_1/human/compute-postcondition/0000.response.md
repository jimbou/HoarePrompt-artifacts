Output State: **The value of testcases is returned by the function func_3().**

The code assigns the return value of the function `func_3()` to the variable `testcases`. Since the initial state specifies that `testcases` is a non-negative integer, the output state will be the value returned by `func_3()`, which is also a non-negative integer.
