This function retrieves or computes and stores the result of calling `func` with `args` as arguments, and returns the result. If `args` is already a key in the dictionary `d`, it returns the existing value associated with `args`. If `args` is not a key in `d`, it computes the result of calling `func` with `args` as arguments, stores it in `d` with `args` as the key, and returns the result.
