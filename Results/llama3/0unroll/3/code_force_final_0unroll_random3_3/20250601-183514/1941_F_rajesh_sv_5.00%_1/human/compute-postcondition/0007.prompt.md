You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n distinct integers in ascending order, D is a sorted list of m distinct integers, and F is a list of k integers.
    n, m, k = func_4()
    A = func_4()
    D = sorted(set(func_4()))
    F = func_4()
    max_diff, next_max_diff, index = -inf, -inf, None
    for i in range(1, n):
        diff = A[i] - A[i - 1]
        
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
            index = i
        elif diff > next_max_diff:
            next_max_diff = diff
        
    #State: Output State: The maximum difference between consecutive elements in list A is stored in max_diff, the index of the maximum difference is stored in index, and the second maximum difference is stored in next_max_diff.
    left, right = A[index - 1], A[index]
    ans = max_diff
    for f in F:
        l = bisect_right(D, left - f)
        
        h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1
        
        while l < h:
            mid = l + (h - l) // 2
            mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
            if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                h = mid
        
        if l == h:
            ans = min(ans, max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f))
        
    #State: The maximum difference between consecutive elements in list A is updated to be the minimum of the current maximum difference and the maximum difference found in the current iteration of the loop, which is the maximum of the difference between the left element and the current element in list D plus the current value of f, and the difference between the current element in list D plus the current value of f and the right element. The index, next_max_diff, left, and right variables remain unchanged.
    print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
    #This is printed: the maximum of ans and next_max_diff (where ans is the current answer and next_max_diff is the next maximum difference between consecutive elements in list A)

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
