Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`, where `x_i` is the input array and `a_i` is the output array.

The function `func_1` calculates the cumulative sum of the input array from right to left and returns the result as a list of integers. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The problem requires finding an array `a_i` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`, which means that `a_i` should be a multiple of `a_{i-1}` and `a_i` should be greater than or equal to `x_i`. The cumulative sum approach does not guarantee this condition.

For example, consider the input array `[2, 4, 1]`. The cumulative sum approach would result in the array `[7, 5, 1]`, which does not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
