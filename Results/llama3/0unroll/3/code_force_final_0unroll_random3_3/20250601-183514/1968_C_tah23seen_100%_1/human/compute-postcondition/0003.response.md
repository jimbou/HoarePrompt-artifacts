Functionality: **This function calculates the cumulative sum of a given list of integers from right to left and returns the result as a list of integers. It takes a list of integers and its length as input, and returns a new list where each element at index i is the sum of all elements in the original list from index i to the end. The function assumes that the input list has a length between 2 and 500, and all elements in the list are between 1 and 500.**
