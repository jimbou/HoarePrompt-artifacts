Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program will output:

999999999 999999999 999999997 999999998

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n.

For instance, x_2 = 2, but a_2 mod a_1 = 999999999 mod 999999999 = 0, not 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
