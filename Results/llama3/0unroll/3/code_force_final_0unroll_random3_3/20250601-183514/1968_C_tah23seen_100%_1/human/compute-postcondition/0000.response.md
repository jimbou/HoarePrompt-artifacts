Output State: **arr is a list of integers, n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr, ans is a list of n integers all equal to 10^9, i is n - 2.**

The code initializes a new list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to `10^9`. It also sets the variable `i` to `n - 2`. The initial state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged.
