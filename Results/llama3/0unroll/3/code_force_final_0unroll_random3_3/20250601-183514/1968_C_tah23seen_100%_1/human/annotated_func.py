#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr.
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: ans is a list of n integers such that ans[i] = sum(arr[j]) for i = 0 to n - 1 and j = i to n - 1, i is -1.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list of n integers where each integer at index i is the sum of all elements in the array from index i to n-1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the cumulative sum of a given list of integers from right to left and returns the result as a list of integers. It takes a list of integers and its length as input, and returns a new list where each element at index i is the sum of all elements in the original list from index i to the end. The function assumes that the input list has a length between 2 and 500, and all elements in the list are between 1 and 500.
