Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it uses a clever approach to solve the problem. It first creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end indices of a subarray with the same elements, along with the element itself. This is done by iterating through the input array and updating the start index whenever a new element is encountered.

Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the tuple that corresponds to the subarray that contains the query's left boundary. If the start index of this tuple is greater than the query's left boundary, it means that the query's left boundary is in a subarray with the same elements, so it prints the indices of the last two elements of this subarray. If the end index of this tuple is greater than or equal to the query's right boundary, it means that the query's right boundary is in a subarray with the same elements, so it prints -1 -1. Otherwise, it prints the indices of the first two elements of the next subarray.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all possible cases, including when the query's boundaries are in the same subarray, when they are in different subarrays, and when there are no different elements in the query's range.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
