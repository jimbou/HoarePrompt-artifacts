stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of integers. The first integer is a non-negative integer. The list of integers is a list of non-negative integers. The second integer is a non-negative integer. The list of pairs of integers is a list of pairs of non-negative integers.
