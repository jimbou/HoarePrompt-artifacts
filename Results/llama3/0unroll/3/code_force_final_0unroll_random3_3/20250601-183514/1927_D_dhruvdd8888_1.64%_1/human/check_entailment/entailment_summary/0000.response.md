Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality by grouping consecutive occurrences of the same integer in the list and storing the start and end indices of each group. For each query, it finds the group that contains the query range and returns the start and end indices of that group. If no such group exists, it returns -1, -1. The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query range is within a single group or when the query range spans multiple groups.

Correctness: **True**
