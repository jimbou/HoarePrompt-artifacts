Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly processes a series of test cases from standard input, groups consecutive occurrences of the same integer in the list, and stores the start and end indices of each group. For each query, it finds the group that contains the query range and returns the start and end indices of that group. If no such group exists, it returns -1, -1.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the group that contains the query range, which makes it efficient for large inputs. The use of the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is correct, as it returns the insertion point for the query range in the list of groups, which is the index of the group that contains the query range.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query range is outside the bounds of the list or when there is no group that contains the query range.

The debugging statements in the program, such as the print statements, do not affect the correctness of the program and can be ignored.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
