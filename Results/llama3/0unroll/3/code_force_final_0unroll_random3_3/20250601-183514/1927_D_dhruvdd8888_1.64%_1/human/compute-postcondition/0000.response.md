Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of N integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**

Here's a breakdown of how the code affects the initial state:

*   The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to N. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.
*   The second line reads N space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to nums. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1.
*   The third line initializes s to 0.
*   The fourth line initializes e to 0.
*   The fifth line assigns the first integer in nums to num.
*   The sixth line initializes arr as an empty list.
*   The seventh line appends -1 to the end of nums, increasing its length by 1.

The final state includes the values of all variables after the code executes, along with the updated state of stdin.
