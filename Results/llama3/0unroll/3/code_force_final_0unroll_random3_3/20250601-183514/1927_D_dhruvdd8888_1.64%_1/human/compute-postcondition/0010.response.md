Functionality: **This function processes a series of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of a list of integers and a set of queries. The function groups consecutive occurrences of the same integer in the list and stores the start and end indices of each group. For each query, it finds the group that contains the query range and returns the start and end indices of that group. If no such group exists, it returns -1, -1. The function also prints the list of integers and the query ranges for debugging purposes if a certain condition is met.**
