Reasoning:  
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices i and j in an array a such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j for each query. The program uses a combination of techniques, including binary search and iteration, to efficiently find the desired indices.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (tc) and iterating over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array (N) and the array elements (nums).
3.  It initializes variables s and e to keep track of the start and end indices of the current segment of equal elements in the array. It also initializes a variable num to store the current element being processed.
4.  The program then iterates over the array, and whenever it encounters a new element, it appends a tuple containing the start index, end index, and the current element to the arr list. This list effectively represents the segments of equal elements in the array.
5.  After processing the entire array, the program reads the number of queries (q) and iterates over each query.
6.  For each query, it reads the left (l) and right (r) boundaries and uses binary search to find the segment in the arr list that corresponds to the query range.
7.  If the query range falls within a single segment of equal elements, the program outputs -1 -1, indicating that no pair of different elements exists within the query range.
8.  If the query range spans multiple segments, the program outputs the start index of the current segment and the end index of the next segment, which guarantees that the elements at these indices are different.

Correctness: **True**
