Postcondition: **N is an integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is N, e is 0, num is the last integer in the original list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples containing the indices of the first occurrence of each integer in the original list of N integers along with the integer itself, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains the remaining test cases, and if ppp is equal to 23, the list of N+1 integers which is nums is being printed.**
