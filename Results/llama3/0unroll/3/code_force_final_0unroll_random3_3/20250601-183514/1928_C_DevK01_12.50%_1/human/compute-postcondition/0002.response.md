Output State: **`q` is an integer such that q <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `w` is a float equal to the square root of `q`, the current value of `w` is an integer (since w == w // 1) and is greater than or equal to `x` - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include the square root of `q`, which is also the value of `w`. The other variables remain unchanged.
