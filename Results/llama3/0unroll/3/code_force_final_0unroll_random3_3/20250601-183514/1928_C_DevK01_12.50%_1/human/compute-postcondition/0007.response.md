Functionality: **This function takes two integers, q and x, as input, where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, and returns a list of all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1. The function includes the square root of q in the list if it is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1. It also includes all other divisors of q that meet the condition, including both the divisor and the quotient if they are greater than or equal to x - 1. The function returns an empty list if no divisors meet the condition.**
