Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different k values that fit under the given constraints. The program uses a function `func_1` to find the divisors of a given number `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The function correctly calculates the divisors and includes the square root of `q` if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the value of `y` as `n + x`, and checks if `y` is even. If `y` is odd, the program prints 0 and continues to the next test case. If `y` is even, the program calls the `func_1` function twice with different values of `q` and `x`, and combines the results to find the total number of different k values that fit under the given constraints.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` is less than `3 * x - 2`, and prints the correct output for each test case.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
