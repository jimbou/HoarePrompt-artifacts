Output State: **The output state will contain n lines, each containing an integer. If the condition b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3 is true for a line, the output will be -1. Otherwise, the output will be the sum of a, the integer division of (b + c) by 3, and 1 if (b + c) is not divisible by 3. The value of n remains unchanged.**
