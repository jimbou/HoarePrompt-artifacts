Functionality: **This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers a, b, and c, and calculates a value k. If b is not divisible by 3 and the sum of b and c is less than 3, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates k as the sum of a, the integer division of (b + c) by 3, and 1 if (b + c) is not divisible by 3. The function prints the calculated value k for each test case, resulting in a total of t output lines.**
