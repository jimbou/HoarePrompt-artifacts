The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). So, the value of `n` is assigned the value of t which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9)**
