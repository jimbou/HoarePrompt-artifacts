Output State: The output will contain `n` lines, each containing an integer `k`. The value of `k` is calculated based on the input values `a`, `b`, and `c` for each line. If `b` is not a multiple of 3 and the sum of `b` and `c` is less than 3, the output will be -1. Otherwise, `k` is the sum of `a` and the integer division of `b + c` by 3, plus 1 if the remainder of `b + c` divided by 3 is not 0.
