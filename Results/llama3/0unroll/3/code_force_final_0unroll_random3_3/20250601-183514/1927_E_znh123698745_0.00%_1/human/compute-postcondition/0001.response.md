Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to n by alternating between incrementing and decrementing indices into the array [1, 2, ..., n], starting with incrementing. The generated sequence is then printed to the console. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
