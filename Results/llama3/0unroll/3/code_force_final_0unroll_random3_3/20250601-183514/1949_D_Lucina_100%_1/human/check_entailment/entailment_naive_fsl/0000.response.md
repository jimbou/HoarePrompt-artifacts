Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the number of undecided transition videos is less than n // 4 - 1. In this case, the program will not be able to assign 'F' or 'S' to all the undecided transition videos, and the output will not meet the requirement that no more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type can be seen in a row.

For example, if n = 8 and the input is:

.??
.??
.??
.??
.??
.??
.??
.??

The program will not be able to assign 'F' or 'S' to all the undecided transition videos, and the output will not meet the requirement.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to use a more sophisticated algorithm to assign 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transition videos, such as a greedy algorithm or a dynamic programming algorithm.
