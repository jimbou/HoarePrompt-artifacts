Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the type of transition videos for each pair of scenarios based on the given constraints. The program first reads the input and populates the 2D list xx with the given transition video plan. It then populates two lists, sa and sb, with indices of a and b, respectively, based on certain conditions. Depending on the length of sa and sb, it either prints n strings of length n, where each string is constructed by iterating over the elements of the 2D list xx and appending 'F' or 'S' based on the current row or column index, or it prints n strings of length n, where each string is populated with 'S' and 'F' characters. The program ensures that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than ceil(3n/4) transition videos of the same type in a row.

Correctness: **True**
