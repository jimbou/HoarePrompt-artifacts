Output State: *The lists sa and sb are populated with indices of a and b, respectively. The indices in sa correspond to elements in a that are greater than 0 and have a corresponding element in b that is 0. The indices in sb correspond to elements in b that are greater than 0 and have a corresponding element in a that is 0, or both a and b are 0. The other variables (n, a, b, and xx) remain unchanged. The length of sa is less than or equal to the length of sb.*
