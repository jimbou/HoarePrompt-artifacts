Postcondition: ***The lists sa and sb are populated with indices of a and b, respectively. The indices in sa correspond to elements in a that are greater than 0 and have a corresponding element in b that is 0. The indices in sb correspond to elements in b that are greater than 0 and have a corresponding element in a that is 0. The other variables (n, a, b, and xx) remain unchanged. If the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb, then the loop has executed n times, printing a string of length n for each iteration. The string nx is constructed by iterating over the elements of the 2D list xx. If an element is not '?', it is appended to nx. If the current row or column index is in the first n // 4 - 1 elements of sa, 'F' is appended to nx; otherwise, 'S' is appended. The values of n, a, b, sa, sb, and xx remain unchanged. If the length of sa is less than the length of sb, then the variable nx is populated with a string of 'S' and 'F' characters. The string nx is printed n times, each time with a different set of 'S' and 'F' characters. The other variables (n, a, b, sa, sb, and xx) remain unchanged.***
