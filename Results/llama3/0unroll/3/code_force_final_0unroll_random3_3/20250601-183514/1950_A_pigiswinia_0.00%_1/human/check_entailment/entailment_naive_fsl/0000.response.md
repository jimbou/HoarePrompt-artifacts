Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input is 3 2 1. According to the problem description, this should be classified as "NONE", but the program incorrectly classifies it as "PEAK". 

The issue is with the condition `elif a < b > c:`. This condition is not doing what the programmer intended. It is checking if `a` is less than `b` and if `b` is greater than `c`, but it is not checking if `b` is greater than `a` and `b` is greater than `c` at the same time. 

The correct condition should be `elif a < b and b > c:`. This condition checks if `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which is the correct condition for a "PEAK".
