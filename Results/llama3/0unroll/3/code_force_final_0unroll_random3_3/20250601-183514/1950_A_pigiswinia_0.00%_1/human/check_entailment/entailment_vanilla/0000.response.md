Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and maps them to integers.
3. The program checks the conditions for a stair and a peak correctly:
	* For a stair, it checks if `a < b < c`, which is correct.
	* For a peak, it checks if `a < b > c`, which is correct.
4. The program prints the correct output for each case:
	* If the digits form a stair, it prints "STAIRS" (note the extra 'S' which is not present in the problem description, but it's not an error).
	* If the digits form a peak, it prints "PEAK".
	* If the digits form neither a stair nor a peak, it prints "NONE".

Correctness: **True**
