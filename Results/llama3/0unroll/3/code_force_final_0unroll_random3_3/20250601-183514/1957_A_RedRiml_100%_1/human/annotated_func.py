#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `w` times, where `w` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each execution, the input is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is equal to `w`. The output is the total number of shapes that can be formed by grouping the integers into sets of three. The shapes are calculated by counting the number of times each integer appears in the list, and then dividing that count by 3. The total number of shapes is the sum of these counts. The output is printed to the console.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then calculates the total number of shapes that can be formed by grouping the integers into sets of three, and prints this total to the console. The function repeats this process for each test case, where the number of test cases is specified by the first integer read from standard input.
