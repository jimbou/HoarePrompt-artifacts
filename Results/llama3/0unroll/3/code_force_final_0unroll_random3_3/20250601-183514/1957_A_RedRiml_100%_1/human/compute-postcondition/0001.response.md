Output State: **The loop has executed `w` times, where `w` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each execution, the input is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is equal to `w`. The output is the total number of shapes that can be formed by grouping the integers into sets of three. The shapes are calculated by counting the number of times each integer appears in the list, and then dividing that count by 3. The total number of shapes is the sum of these counts. The output is printed to the console.**
