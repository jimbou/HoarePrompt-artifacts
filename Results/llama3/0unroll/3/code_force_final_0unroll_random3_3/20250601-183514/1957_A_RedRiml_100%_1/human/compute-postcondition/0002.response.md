Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then calculates the total number of shapes that can be formed by grouping the integers into sets of three, and prints this total to the console. The function repeats this process for each test case, where the number of test cases is specified by the first integer read from standard input.**
