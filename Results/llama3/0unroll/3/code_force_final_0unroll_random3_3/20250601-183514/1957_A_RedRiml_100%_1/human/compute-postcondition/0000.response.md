Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of one line. The line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100), where n is equal to `w`.**

In this output state, the value of `w` is assigned the value of the first line of the test case, which is an integer between 1 and 100. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now consists of only one line, which contains n integers, where n is equal to the value of `w`.
