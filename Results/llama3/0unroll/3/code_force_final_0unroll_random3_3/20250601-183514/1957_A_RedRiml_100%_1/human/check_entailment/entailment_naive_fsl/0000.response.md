Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 3. This is because the program only checks for triangles (3 sides) and does not consider other regular polygons with more sides.

The program should be modified to check for all possible regular polygons, not just triangles. It should also consider the fact that a stick can be used in more than one polygon, as long as it is not used in more than one side of the same polygon.
