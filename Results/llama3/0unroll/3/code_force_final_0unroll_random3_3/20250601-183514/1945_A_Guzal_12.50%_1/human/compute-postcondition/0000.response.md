The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, each containing three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, the first test case is consumed by this input operation.

The value of `n` is now equal to the number of test cases, which is a non-negative integer.

The remaining test cases are still in the input buffer, waiting to be processed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
