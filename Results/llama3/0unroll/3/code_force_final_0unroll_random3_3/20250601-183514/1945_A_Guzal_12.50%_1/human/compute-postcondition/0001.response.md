Output State: **The number of test cases `n` remains unchanged, but for each test case, the output will be the calculated value of `k`, which represents the total number of items that can be formed using the given values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `k` is calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If the conditions are not met, the output will be -1.**
