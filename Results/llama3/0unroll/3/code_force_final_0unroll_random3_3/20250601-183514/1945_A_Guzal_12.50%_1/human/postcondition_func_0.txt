This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It then calculates and prints the total number of items that can be formed using these values, following specific conditions. If the conditions are not met, it prints -1. The function processes all test cases and outputs the calculated values or -1 for each case, without modifying the original input values.
