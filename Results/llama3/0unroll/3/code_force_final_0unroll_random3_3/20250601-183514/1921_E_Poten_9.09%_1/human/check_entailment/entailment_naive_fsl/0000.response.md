Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the difference between the x-coordinates of Alice's and Bob's chips is 1, and the difference between their y-coordinates is also 1. In this case, the program incorrectly determines the outcome of the game.

For example, if the input is "10 10 9 1 8 2", the program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice". This is because Alice can move her chip to the cell (10, 2) and win the game.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly consider all possible moves that Alice and Bob can make. It only checks if the difference between their x-coordinates is even or odd, and if the difference between their y-coordinates is greater than 1. However, this is not sufficient to determine the outcome of the game in all cases.

To correctly determine the outcome of the game, the program needs to consider all possible moves that Alice and Bob can make, and check if either of them can win the game. This requires a more complex algorithm that takes into account the positions of both chips and the possible moves that each player can make.
