Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of six integers representing the dimensions of a grid and the positions of two players, Alice and Bob. It then determines the winner of each test case based on the positions of the players and the dimensions of the grid, and prints the result of each test case to the console. The possible outcomes are 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the order they were received.**
