You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: two space-separated integers x and y such that 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99.
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: an integer between 1 and 89 (which is the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: the ceiling of the division of y by 2 (where y is an integer between 0 and 99 and is currently greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: the ceiling of the division of x by 15 (where x is an integer between 1 and 99)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0. It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.
        #State: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.
    #State: *`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is an integer between -1484 and 583, `y` is an integer between 1 and 99, bxsfory is an integer between 1 and 50, bxsfory1 is an integer between 0 and 39, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0, then either the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 is printed if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, or the number 0 is printed if both `x` and `y` are 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: x is an integer between -1484 and 583, y is an integer between 1 and 99, bxsfory is an integer between 1 and 50, bxsfory1 is an integer between 0 and 39, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed

Case_2: `x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0. It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, and the number 0 is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
