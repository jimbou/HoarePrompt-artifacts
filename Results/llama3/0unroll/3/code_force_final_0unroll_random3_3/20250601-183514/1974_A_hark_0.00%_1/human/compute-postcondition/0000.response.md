The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer representing the number of test cases first and that integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains no input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is t is an integer representing the number of test cases.
Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains no input**
