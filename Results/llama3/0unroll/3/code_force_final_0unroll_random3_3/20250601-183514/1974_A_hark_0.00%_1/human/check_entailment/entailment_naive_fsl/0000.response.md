Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when x = 14 and y = 1, the program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. This is because the program is not considering the case where the 2x2 icon can be placed in the remaining space of the first screen.

In the given program, the line `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` is calculating the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, but it is not considering the remaining space in the first screen. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider the remaining space in the first screen when placing the 2x2 icons.
