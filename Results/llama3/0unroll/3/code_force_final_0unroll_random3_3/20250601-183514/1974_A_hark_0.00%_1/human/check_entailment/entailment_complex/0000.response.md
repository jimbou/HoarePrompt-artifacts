Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` is a simple function that compares two non-negative integers and returns the smaller of the two. This function is not directly related to the problem at hand but is likely used as a helper function.

`func_2` is the core function that solves the problem. It takes two space-separated integers `x` and `y` as input from stdin, where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`. It then performs calculations based on the values of `x` and `y` and prints an integer value representing the minimum number of screens needed.

The calculations performed by `func_2` are based on the problem description. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed by adjusting `x` based on `y` and then printing the sum of the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 and the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 plus 1. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of the non-zero value divided by 2 or 15, respectively. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

`func_3` is the main function that executes a specified number of test cases by reading an integer from standard input and running `func_2` that many times.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program correctly solves the problem. The calculations performed by `func_2` are consistent with the problem description, and the program handles all possible input cases correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
