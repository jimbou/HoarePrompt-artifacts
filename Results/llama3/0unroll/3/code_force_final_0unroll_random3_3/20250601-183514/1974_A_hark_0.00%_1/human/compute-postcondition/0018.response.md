Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, then `x` is an integer between -1484 and 583, `y` is an integer between 1 and 99, bxsfory is an integer between 1 and 50, bxsfory1 is an integer between 0 and 39, and the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is being printed. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0, then either the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 is printed if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 is printed if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, or the number 0 is printed if both `x` and `y` are 0.***
