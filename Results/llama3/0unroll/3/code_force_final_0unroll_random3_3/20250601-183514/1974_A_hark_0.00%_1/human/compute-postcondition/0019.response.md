Functionality: **This function takes two space-separated integers x and y as input from stdin, where 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. It then performs calculations based on the values of x and y, and prints an integer value. If both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates and prints the sum of two values: the ceiling of y divided by 2, and the ceiling of x divided by 15 plus 1, after adjusting x based on y. If either x is 0 or y is 0, it prints the ceiling of the non-zero value divided by 2 or 15, respectively. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value, but rather prints the calculated result directly.**
