The code prints the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15.
Since `x` is an integer between 0 and 99 and `y` is 0, and it is given that `x` is greater than 0, the value of `x` is between 1 and 99.
The ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 will be the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to `x` divided by 15.
Output: **the ceiling of the division of x by 15 (where x is an integer between 1 and 99)**
