Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin contains no input. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0. It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 is printed. Otherwise, the number 0 is printed.***
