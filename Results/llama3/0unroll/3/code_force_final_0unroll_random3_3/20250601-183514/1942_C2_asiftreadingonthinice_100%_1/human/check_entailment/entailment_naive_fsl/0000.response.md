Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. It first calculates the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and the additional vertices that can be chosen. It then calculates the number of triangles that can be formed by choosing additional vertices to fill the gaps between the chosen vertices. The program correctly handles the case where the number of additional vertices that can be chosen is less than the number of gaps, and it also correctly handles the case where the number of additional vertices that can be chosen is greater than or equal to the number of gaps.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the number of chosen vertices is 2, in which case the number of triangles that can be formed is 0.

The program correctly outputs the minimum of the total number of triangles that can be formed and n-2, which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed in a polygon with n sides.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.
