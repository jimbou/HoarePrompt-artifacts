Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of operations required to make all numbers in the range from 1 to n appear exactly once, given the initial set of numbers in each test case. The list contains t-1 integers, where t is the initial value of tt.
