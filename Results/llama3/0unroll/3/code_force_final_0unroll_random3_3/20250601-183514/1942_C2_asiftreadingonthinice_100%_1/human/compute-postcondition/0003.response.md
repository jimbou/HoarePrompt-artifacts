Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an array of distinct integers and two parameters, x and y. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the array a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is the total number of elements in the permutation. The function considers two types of operations: swapping adjacent elements and inserting/deleting elements. It uses the given parameter y to determine the number of insertions/deletions allowed. The function returns a list of integers, each representing the minimum number of operations required for each test case, capped at n-2.**
