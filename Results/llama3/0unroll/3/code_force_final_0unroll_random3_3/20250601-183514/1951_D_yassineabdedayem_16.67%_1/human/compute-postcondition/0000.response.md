Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, stdin contains t lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
