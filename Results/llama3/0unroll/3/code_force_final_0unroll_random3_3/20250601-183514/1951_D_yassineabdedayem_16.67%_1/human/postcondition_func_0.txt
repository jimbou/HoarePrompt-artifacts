This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints output to standard output. It accepts a variable number of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers, and attempts to find a sequence of numbers that satisfy a specific condition. If a valid sequence is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. If no valid sequence is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external state, only printing output to standard output.
