Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is less than `k` and `n` is not equal to 0. In this case, the program will print "NO" even if it is possible to set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.

For example, if `n` is 5 and `k` is 3, the program will print "NO" because `n` is less than `k`. However, it is possible to set up the stalls to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels. One possible solution is to set up two stalls with prices 2 and 3, respectively. Alice will buy 2 jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, leaving her with 0 coins.

The program does not handle this case correctly because it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `k` before trying to set up the stalls. If `n` is less than `k`, it immediately prints "NO" without trying to find a solution.
