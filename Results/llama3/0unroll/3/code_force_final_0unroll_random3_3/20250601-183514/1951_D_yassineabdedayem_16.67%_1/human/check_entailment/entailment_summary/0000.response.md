Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible for Bob to set up the store such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program iteratively calculates the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall, ensuring that the total number of jewels bought is exactly k. If it's possible to achieve this, the program prints 'YES' followed by the number of stalls and the prices for each stall. If it's not possible, the program prints 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the constraints, such as the maximum number of stalls (60) and the range of prices (1 to 10^18). The use of the `min` and `max` functions ensures that the calculated prices are within the valid range.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the provided example inputs and outputs demonstrate the program's correctness.

Correctness: **True**
