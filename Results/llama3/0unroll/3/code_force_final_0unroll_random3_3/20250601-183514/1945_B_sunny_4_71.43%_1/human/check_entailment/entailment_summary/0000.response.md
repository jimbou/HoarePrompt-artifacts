Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by summing up the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation within the time frame m + 1 minutes. The use of integer division (//) and the addition of 1 ensures that the program correctly handles cases where m is not exactly divisible by a or b. The program also correctly handles the case where a or b is 1, as the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched in this case is m + 1.

Correctness: **True**
