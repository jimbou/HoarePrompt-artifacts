Reasoning:

The problem asks for the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by summing the ceiling of m/a and m/b, where m is the time the firework is visible in the sky, and a and b are the frequencies of launching for the first and second installations, respectively.

The program's approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch. By calculating the ceiling of m/a and m/b, the program effectively counts the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched by each installation within the time frame of m + 1 minutes.

The program's use of integer division (int(m / a)) and adding 1 to the result is also correct, as it ensures that the program counts the maximum number of fireworks that can be launched, even if m is not exactly divisible by a or b.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
