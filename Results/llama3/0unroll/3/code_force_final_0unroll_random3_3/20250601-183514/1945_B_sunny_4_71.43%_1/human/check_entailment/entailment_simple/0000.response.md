Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), rounding up to the nearest whole number using the int(m / a) + 1 and int(m / b) + 1 expressions, and then summing these values.

This approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that fireworks from the same installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time if the time between launches is greater than the time the firework is visible. By rounding up to the nearest whole number, the program ensures that it counts the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time.

The program also correctly handles the case where the time between launches is equal to the time the firework is visible, as demonstrated in the example where a = 1, b = 1, and m = 1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
