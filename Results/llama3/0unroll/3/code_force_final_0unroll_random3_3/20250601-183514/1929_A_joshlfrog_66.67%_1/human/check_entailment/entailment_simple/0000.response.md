Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum and minimum elements in the array and then printing their difference. However, this approach is incorrect.

The correct approach would be to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by arranging the elements in increasing order, which maximizes the sum of the differences.

The given program does not sort the array, and instead, it only finds the maximum and minimum elements. This is not sufficient to calculate the maximum beauty of the array.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
