Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array and prints their difference.

The program's logic is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by rearranging the elements in ascending order. The difference between the maximum and minimum elements is the maximum possible beauty of the array.

However, the program can be optimized by using the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array, instead of iterating over the array again.

Correctness: **True**
