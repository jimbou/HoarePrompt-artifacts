The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` test cases. After reading the first integer, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
