Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program reads the number of test cases, the length of each array, and the elements of each array. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers in each array and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct. It first finds the maximum and minimum numbers in each array, and then calculates the difference between them. This difference represents the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

The program's execution summary also confirms that it is working as expected. It reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers in each test case.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
