Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the number of test cases, followed by the results of each test case. Each test case result consists of two integers, the first representing the maximum value in the range [1, n] and the second representing the index of the maximum value in the range [1, n]. The output state is in the format: "number of test cases\nresult1\nresult2\n...\nresultn", where each result is in the format "mak2 mak".**
