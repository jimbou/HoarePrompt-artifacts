Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where it needs to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a series of queries to the input stream to achieve this.

The program first finds the maximum value in the range [1, n] by comparing each value with the current maximum. It then finds all indices that have the maximum value. Finally, it finds the index that has the maximum XOR value with the maximum value found earlier.

The program uses a total of 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are used to compare the maximum value with other values, and to find the index that has the maximum XOR value with the maximum value.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to find the correct indices i and j that maximize p_i XOR p_j.

Correctness: **True**
