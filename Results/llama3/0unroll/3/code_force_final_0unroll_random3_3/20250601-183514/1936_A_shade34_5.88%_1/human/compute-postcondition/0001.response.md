Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n. For each test case, it finds the maximum value and its index in the range [1, n] by querying the input stream and then outputs the result in the format "maximum value index". The function repeats this process for all test cases and outputs the results in the format "number of test cases\nresult1\nresult2\n...\nresultn".**
