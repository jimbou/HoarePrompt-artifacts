Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50, stdin contains t lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 50, which was read from the first input in stdin. The remaining inputs in stdin are still present, consisting of `t` lines each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50.
