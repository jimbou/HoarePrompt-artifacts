Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description requires the string to consist of uppercase Latin letters, but the program generates a string consisting of digits ('1' and '0'). 

For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs "YES" and "111000", which does not meet the problem's requirements. The correct output should be a string of uppercase Latin letters, such as "AAABAACC".
