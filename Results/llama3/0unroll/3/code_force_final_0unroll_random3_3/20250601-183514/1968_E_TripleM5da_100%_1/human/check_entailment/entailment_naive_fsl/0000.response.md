Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This is because the program is not correctly implementing the strategy to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The program is simply printing the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and then (i, i) for i from 3 to n, which does not guarantee the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

A correct implementation would involve a more sophisticated strategy to choose the coordinates that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
