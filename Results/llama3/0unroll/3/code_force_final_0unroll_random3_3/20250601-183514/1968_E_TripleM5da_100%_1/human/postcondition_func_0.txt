The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n. For each test case, it prints a specific pattern of numbers to standard output, starting with "1 1" and "1 2", followed by "i i" for i ranging from 3 to n. The function processes multiple test cases and produces a total of 2t + 2 lines of output, where t is the number of test cases.
