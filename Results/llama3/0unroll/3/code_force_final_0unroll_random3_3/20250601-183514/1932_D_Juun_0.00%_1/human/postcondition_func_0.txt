The function processes a series of card game test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a set of cards with ranks and suits. It identifies the trump suit and separates the cards into trump cards and non-trump cards. For each non-trump suit, it finds the highest rank and pairs it with a trump card, if available. If no trump cards are available, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. Otherwise, it prints the paired cards in a sorted order, followed by any remaining trump cards in pairs. The function returns no value but prints the results of the card game processing to the standard output.
