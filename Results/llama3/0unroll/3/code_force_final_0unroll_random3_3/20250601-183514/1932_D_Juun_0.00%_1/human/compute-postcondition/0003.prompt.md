Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has processed all the cards in the input, and the state of the variables has been updated accordingly. The 'trumps' list contains all the ranks of the cards that have the same suit as the 'trump' character. The 'answers' list contains strings representing the sorted ranks of the cards for each suit, excluding the trump suit. The 'suits' dictionary has been updated to reflect the highest rank of each suit that has been seen so far, or None if no cards of that suit have been seen.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
