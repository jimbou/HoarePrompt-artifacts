Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to reconstruct the rounds played in the card game by pairing cards from the discard pile. It handles the cases where a trump card can beat any non-trump card and where trump cards can only be beaten by higher-ranking trump cards. The program also correctly identifies and handles the case where there is no possible sequence of rounds that might have been played in the game, printing 'IMPOSSIBLE' in such cases.

Correctness: **True**
