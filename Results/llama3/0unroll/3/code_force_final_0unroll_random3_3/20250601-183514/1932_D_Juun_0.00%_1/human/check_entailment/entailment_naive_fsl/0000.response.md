Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when there are two or more cards of the same suit that are not trump cards. In this case, the program will not be able to find a valid sequence of rounds, but it will not print "IMPOSSIBLE" either. It will simply ignore these cards and print the sequences for the other cards.

For example, if the input is:

3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S 4D 5D

The program will print:

3C 4C
6D 9S
3S 7S

But it will ignore the cards 4D and 5D, which are both diamonds and are not trump cards. This is not a valid solution, because the problem statement requires that all cards be used in the sequence of rounds.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
