Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
4. If the length of the array `n` is 1, it correctly prints 1, because the median of a single-element array is the element itself, and increasing it by 1 requires 1 operation.
5. If the length of the array `n` is greater than 1, it correctly calculates the index of the median element `mdx` using the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula works because the median of an array with an odd length is the middle element, and the median of an array with an even length is the average of the two middle elements.
6. It then correctly counts the number of occurrences of the median element in the array `a` by iterating from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array and incrementing the count `res` whenever it finds an element equal to the median.
7. Finally, it correctly prints the count `res`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
