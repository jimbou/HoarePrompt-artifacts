The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer (the length of the array), this integer is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the array, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains a list of integers (the array) and possibly more test cases**
