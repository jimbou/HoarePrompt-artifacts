Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` will be 0, and the variable `n` will be the length of the last array in the input, and the variable `a` will be the last array in the input sorted in ascending order, and the variable `res` will be the number of occurrences of the median element in the last array, and the variable `mdx` will be the index of the median element in the last array.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will have processed all the test cases in the input, and the variables will hold the values corresponding to the last test case. The variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` will be the length of the last array, and the variable `a` will be the last array sorted in ascending order. The variable `res` will be the number of occurrences of the median element in the last array, and the variable `mdx` will be the index of the median element in the last array.
