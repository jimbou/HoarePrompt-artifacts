Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. The program first sorts the array in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
2. It then checks if the length of the array is 1. If it is, the program prints 1, because increasing the only element in the array will increase the median.
3. If the length of the array is more than 1, the program calculates the index of the median (mdx) using the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula correctly calculates the index of the median for both even and odd length arrays.
4. The program then iterates over the elements of the array starting from the median index (mdx) to the end of the array. For each element, it checks if the element is equal to the median. If it is, it increments the result (res) by 1.
5. Finally, the program prints the result (res), which represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The program works correctly for all possible cases because it correctly calculates the median index and then counts the number of elements that need to be increased to increase the median. The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting, and the space complexity is O(n) for the input array.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
