Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer (array length) followed by a list of integers (the array).
2.  It sorts each array in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
3.  If the array has only one element, it correctly prints 1, as increasing the single element will increase the median.
4.  For arrays with more than one element, it correctly calculates the median index (`mdx`) using the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula handles both even and odd-length arrays correctly.
5.  It then counts the occurrences of the median element in the sorted array, starting from the median index (`mdx`) to the end of the array. This is because increasing any of these occurrences will increase the median.
6.  Finally, it prints the count of the median element, which represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
