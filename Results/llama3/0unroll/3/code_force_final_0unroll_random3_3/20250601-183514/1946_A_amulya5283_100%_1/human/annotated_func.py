#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the length of the array) and then a list of integers (the array). The length of the array is a non-negative integer and the integers in the array are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` will be 0, and the variable `n` will be the length of the last array in the input, and the variable `a` will be the last array in the input sorted in ascending order, and the variable `res` will be the number of occurrences of the median element in the last array, and the variable `mdx` will be the index of the median element in the last array.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (array length) followed by a list of integers (the array). It sorts each array in ascending order and calculates the number of occurrences of the median element. If the array has only one element, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the count of the median element. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results for each case.
