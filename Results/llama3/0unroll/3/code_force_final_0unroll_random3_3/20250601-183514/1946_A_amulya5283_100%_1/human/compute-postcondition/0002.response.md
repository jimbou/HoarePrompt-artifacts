Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (array length) followed by a list of integers (the array). It sorts each array in ascending order and calculates the number of occurrences of the median element. If the array has only one element, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the count of the median element. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results for each case.**
