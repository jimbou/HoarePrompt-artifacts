Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same, and if not, it finds the minimum count of the first element in the array.

The program's logic is correct. It first checks if all elements in the array are the same, and if so, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful. If the array contains different elements, it finds the minimum count of the first element in the array, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's use of the `Decimal` module is unnecessary, as the problem does not require decimal arithmetic. However, this does not affect the program's correctness.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
