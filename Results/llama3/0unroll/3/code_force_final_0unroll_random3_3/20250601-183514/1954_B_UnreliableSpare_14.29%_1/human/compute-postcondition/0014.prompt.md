You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) that form a beautiful array.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, flag is False
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of cnt is the number of occurrences of the first element of arr in arr, and the value of ans is the minimum number of occurrences of any element in arr that is equal to the first element of arr. The values of t, n, flag, and val remain unchanged.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: the minimum value between the previous value of ans and the count of the first element of arr in arr
    #State: *The value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the number of occurrences of the first element of `arr` in `arr`, and the values of `t`, `n`, `val` remain unchanged. If `flag` is True, -1 is printed. If `flag` is False, the value of `ans` is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the number of occurrences of the first element of `arr` in `arr`, and the values of `t`, `n`, `val` remain unchanged. The current value of `flag` is True, and -1 is being printed

Case_2: The value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the number of occurrences of the first element of `arr` in `arr`, the values of `t`, `n`, `flag`, and `val` remain unchanged, and `flag` is false, and the value of `ans` is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
