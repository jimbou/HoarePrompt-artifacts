Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] should return 1, but the program returns 2.

The issue is that the program is finding the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element, but it's not considering the fact that the array can be made non-beautiful by removing a single element from the middle of the array, not just from the beginning or end.

For example, in the case [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], removing the middle element 2 would make the array [1, 1, 2, 1] which is not beautiful. But the program would return 2, which is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element 1.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of both elements, not just the first element.
