Output State: The loop iterates from 1 to n-1, checking if the current element in the array is different from the previous one. If it finds a pair of different elements, it sets the flag to False and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding any different elements, the flag remains True. The output state is: flag is True if all elements in the array are the same, False otherwise.
