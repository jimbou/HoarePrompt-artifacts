Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, flag is False, ans is Infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0**

The code initializes a new variable `ans` to infinity, and assigns the first element of the list `arr` to `val` and 0 to `cnt`. The values of `stdin`, `n`, `arr`, and `flag` remain unchanged.
