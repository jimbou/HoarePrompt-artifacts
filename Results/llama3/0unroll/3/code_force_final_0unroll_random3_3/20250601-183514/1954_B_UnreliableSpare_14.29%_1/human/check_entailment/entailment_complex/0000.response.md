Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same, and if so, it prints -1. If not, it finds the minimum count of any element in the array and prints it.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same, and it correctly finds the minimum count of any element in the array when they are not all the same.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable `ans` is initialized to `Decimal('Infinity')`, which is not necessary. The variable `ans` can be initialized to a large integer value, such as `10**9`, instead.

Additionally, the program can be optimized by breaking out of the loop as soon as it finds a pair of different elements. This is because the array is beautiful, and once a pair of different elements is found, the minimum count of any element is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the count of the first element.

Overall, the program is correct, but it can be improved for efficiency and readability.

Correctness: **True**
