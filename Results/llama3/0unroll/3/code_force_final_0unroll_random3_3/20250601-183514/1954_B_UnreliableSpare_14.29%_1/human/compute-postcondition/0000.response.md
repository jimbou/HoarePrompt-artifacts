Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, flag is True**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to n. Since stdin initially contains an integer t followed by t test cases, after reading one integer, stdin will contain t-1 test cases. The second line reads n integers from stdin and assigns them to arr. Since each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers, after reading n integers, stdin will still contain t-1 test cases. The third line assigns True to flag.
