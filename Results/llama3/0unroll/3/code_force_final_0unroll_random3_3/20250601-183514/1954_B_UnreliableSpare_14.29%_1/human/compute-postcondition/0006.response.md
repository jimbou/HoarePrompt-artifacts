The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is the number of occurrences of the first element of `arr` in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum number of occurrences of any element in `arr` that is equal to the first element of `arr`, the value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the number of occurrences of the first element of `arr` in `arr`.

Output State: **The value of `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the number of occurrences of the first element of `arr` in `arr`, and the values of `t`, `n`, `flag`, and `val` remain unchanged.**
