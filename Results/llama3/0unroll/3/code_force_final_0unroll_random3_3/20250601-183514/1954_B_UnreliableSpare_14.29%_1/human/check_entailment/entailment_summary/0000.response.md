Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements. If the elements are not all the same, it finds the minimum count of any element in the array and prints it. This is because removing the minimum count of any element will make the array not beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
