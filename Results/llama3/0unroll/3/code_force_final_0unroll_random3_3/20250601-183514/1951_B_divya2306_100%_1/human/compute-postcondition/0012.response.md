Output: **The value of `win_with_swap` is the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to the element at index `k-1`, plus the number of elements in the list `a` that are greater than the element at index `k-1` but are still less than or equal to the element at index `i-1`, the value of `i` is the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than the element at index `k-1`, or `n` if no such element exists, the values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the value of `win_with_swap` is less than or equal to `k`, and the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is being printed**
