Output State: The loop has executed n-1 times, and the nodes dictionary now contains adjacency lists for all nodes in the graph. Each key in the nodes dictionary corresponds to a node in the graph, and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The edges list remains empty, and the empty variable remains True. The value of t is still 1, and the stdin contains one integer u_1.
