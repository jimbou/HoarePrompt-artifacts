Output State: **The loop has executed n-1 times, and the nodes dictionary now contains adjacency lists for all nodes in the graph. Each key in the nodes dictionary corresponds to a node in the graph, and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The edges list remains empty, and the empty variable remains True. The value of t is still 1, and the stdin contains one integer u_1. A new variable ends has been created and is assigned an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The loop has executed n-1 times, and the nodes dictionary now contains adjacency lists for all nodes in the graph. Each key in the nodes dictionary corresponds to a node in the graph, and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The edges list remains empty, and the empty variable remains True. The value of t is still 1, and the stdin contains one integer u_1. Additionally, a new variable ends has been created and is assigned an empty list.
