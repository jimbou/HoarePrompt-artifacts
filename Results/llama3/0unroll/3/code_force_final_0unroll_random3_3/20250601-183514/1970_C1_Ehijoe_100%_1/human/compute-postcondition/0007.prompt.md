Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed n times, and the nodes dictionary remains unchanged. The edges list remains empty, and the empty variable remains True. The value of t is still 1, and the stdin contains one integer u_1. The ends list now contains all nodes in the graph that have only one neighboring node. The s and e variables are assigned the first and second elements of the ends list, respectively. The tree list is initialized with the value of s. The prev variable is set to s, and the curr variable is set to the first neighboring node of s in the nodes dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
