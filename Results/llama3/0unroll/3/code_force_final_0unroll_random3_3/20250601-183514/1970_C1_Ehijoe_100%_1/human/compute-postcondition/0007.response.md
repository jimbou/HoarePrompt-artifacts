Output State: **The loop has executed n times, and the nodes dictionary remains unchanged. The edges list remains empty, and the empty variable remains True. The value of t is still 1, and the stdin contains one integer u_1. The ends list now contains all nodes in the graph that have only one neighboring node. The s and e variables are assigned the first and second elements of the ends list, respectively. The tree list is initialized with the value of s. The prev variable is set to s, and the curr variable is set to the first neighboring node of s in the nodes dictionary.**
