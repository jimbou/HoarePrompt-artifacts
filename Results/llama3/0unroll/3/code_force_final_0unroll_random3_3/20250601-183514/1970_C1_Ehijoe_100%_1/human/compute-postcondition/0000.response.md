Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, t is 1, edges is an empty list, empty is True, nodes is an empty dictionary, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.**

Explanation:

*   The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `t`, respectively. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, and `t` is 1, these values are assigned to the variables.
*   The second line initializes an empty list `edges`.
*   The third line sets the variable `empty` to `True`.
*   The fourth line creates an empty dictionary `nodes` using the `defaultdict` function from the `collections` module.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

*   `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5.
*   `t` is 1.
*   `edges` is an empty list.
*   `empty` is `True`.
*   `nodes` is an empty dictionary.
*   Stdin contains `n-1` lines each containing two integers `u` and `v`, and one integer `u_1`.
