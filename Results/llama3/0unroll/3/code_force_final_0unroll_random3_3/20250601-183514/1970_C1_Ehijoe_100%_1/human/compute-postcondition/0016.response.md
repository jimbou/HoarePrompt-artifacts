Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on the structure of a tree-like graph and the starting position of a player. It reads input from stdin, constructs the graph, identifies the nodes with only one neighboring node (ends), and finds the path between these ends. The function then determines the number of moves required to reach each end from a given starting position and prints 'Ron' if at least one move is odd, or 'Hermione' if all moves are even.**
