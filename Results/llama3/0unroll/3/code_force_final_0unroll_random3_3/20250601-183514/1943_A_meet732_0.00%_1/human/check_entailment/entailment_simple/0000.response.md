Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize the score.

The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using the `cntl` list. Then, it checks if the count of 0 is 0. If it is, the program prints 0, because the MEX of an empty array is 0.

If the count of 0 is not 0, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0. This is because Alice can choose at most two 0's to maximize the score.

Then, the program iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each number `j`, it checks if the count of `j` is less than 2. If it is, the program decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the program prints `j`, because the MEX of the array `c` is `j`.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
