Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly implement the game's strategy for maximizing the MEX score. Here's a breakdown of why I believe the program is correct:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the input array `a` using the `cntl` list.
2. If there are no zeros in the input array, the program correctly prints 0 as the MEX score.
3. Otherwise, the program initializes a variable `c` to 2 if there are at least two zeros in the input array, and to 1 otherwise. This is because Alice can always choose a zero on her first turn, and Bob can't block her from doing so.
4. The program then iterates through the numbers from 1 to `n`, and for each number `j`, it checks if the count of `j` in the input array is less than 2. If it is, the program decrements `c` by 1. This is because if there is only one occurrence of `j` in the input array, Bob can block Alice from choosing it on her turn.
5. If `c` becomes 0 or the program reaches the end of the iteration, it prints the current number `j` as the MEX score.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work as expected. The program correctly handles the edge cases where there are no zeros in the input array, and it correctly implements the game's strategy for maximizing the MEX score. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
