The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases, we can conclude that `t` will be assigned a value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The input is consumed up to the first line, so the remaining input will be the test cases, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.**
