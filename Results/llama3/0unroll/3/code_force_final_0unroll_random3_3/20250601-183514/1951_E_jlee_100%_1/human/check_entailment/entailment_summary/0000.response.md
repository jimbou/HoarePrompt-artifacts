Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all the possible cases as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the string has only one character. If so, it prints 'NO' because a single character is always a palindrome.

2. It then checks if the first and last characters of the string are different. If they are, it prints 'YES', 1, and the string itself because the string is already not a palindrome.

3. If the first and last characters are the same, it checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints 'NO' because any substring of this string will be a palindrome.

4. If not all characters are the same, it checks if all characters except one are the same. If so, it checks if the length of the string is odd and the middle character is different from the first and last characters. If this condition is met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 1, and the string itself.

5. If none of the above conditions are met, it iterates over the string to find a pair of characters that are not the same when mirrored around the center of the string. If it finds such a pair, it prints 'YES', 1, and the string itself.

6. If it doesn't find such a pair, it tries to split the string into two substrings at the point where the first character that is not the same as the first character of the string appears. If the second substring is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', 2, and the two substrings. If the second substring is a palindrome, it tries to split the string at the point before the first character that is not the same as the first character of the string. If the second substring is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', 2, and the two substrings.

7. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
