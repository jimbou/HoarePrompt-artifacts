This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It determines whether the string can be split into two substrings such that the first substring is not equal to the last substring. If possible, it prints 'YES', the minimum number of splits required (1 or 2), and the resulting substrings. If not possible, it prints 'NO'. The function handles various cases, including strings with all identical characters, strings with only one character different from the first and last characters, and strings with multiple characters different from the first and last characters.
