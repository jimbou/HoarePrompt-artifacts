Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that for each test case, the program will print either 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether it is possible to split the string into two substrings such that the first substring is not equal to the last substring. If 'YES' is printed, the program will also print the minimum number of splits required (either 1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If 'NO' is printed, it means that it is not possible to split the string into two substrings such that the first substring is not equal to the last substring. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the stdin contains the same multiple test cases.**
