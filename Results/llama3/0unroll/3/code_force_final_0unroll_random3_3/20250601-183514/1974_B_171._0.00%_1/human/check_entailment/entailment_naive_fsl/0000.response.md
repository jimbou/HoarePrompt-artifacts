Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem. The issue lies in the way the mapping between characters is created. The program creates a mapping between the characters in the encoded string and the characters in the alphabet, but it does not take into account the symmetric property of the encoding.

In the encoding process, the first character of the string `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on. However, in the decoding process, the program does not reverse this mapping. Instead, it creates a new mapping between the characters in the encoded string and the characters in the alphabet, which is not correct.

For example, if the encoded string is "serofedsoc", the correct decoding should be "codeforces". However, the program will not produce this output because it does not correctly implement the symmetric mapping.

To fix this issue, the program should create a mapping between the characters in the encoded string and the characters in the string `r`, and then use this mapping to decode the string. The string `r` can be created by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string in alphabetical order.
