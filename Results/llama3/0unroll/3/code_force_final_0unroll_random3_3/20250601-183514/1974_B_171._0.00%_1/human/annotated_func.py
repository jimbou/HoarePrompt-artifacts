    #State: mapping is a dictionary where each key is a lowercase Latin letter and its corresponding value is a lowercase Latin letter from the encoded string, and decoded is a list of lowercase Latin letters where each element is a decoded character from the encoded string.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that consists of all the decoded characters from the encoded string, where each character is a lowercase Latin letter.

#Overall this is what the function does:Decodes an encoded string consisting of lowercase Latin letters by creating a mapping between the encoded characters and lowercase Latin letters, and returns the decoded string.
