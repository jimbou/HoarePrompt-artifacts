Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The program creates a mapping between the encoded characters and lowercase Latin letters, but it does not correctly replace the characters in the encoded string with their symmetric characters from the auxiliary string r.

The correct approach would be to first construct the auxiliary string r by finding all distinct letters in the encoded string and sorting them in alphabetical order. Then, for each character in the encoded string, find its symmetric character in the auxiliary string r and replace it with that character.

The given program does not follow this approach and instead creates a mapping between the encoded characters and lowercase Latin letters, which is not the correct way to decode the string.

Correctness: **False**
