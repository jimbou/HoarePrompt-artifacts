Output State: **stdin contains t inputs: strings consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, each string's length is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), s is a list of characters from the first input string, n is the length of the first input string**.

The first line of the code reads the first input from stdin, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and assigns it to the variable `s` as a list of characters. The second line calculates the length of this string and assigns it to the variable `n`. The remaining `t` inputs in stdin are not affected by the code.
