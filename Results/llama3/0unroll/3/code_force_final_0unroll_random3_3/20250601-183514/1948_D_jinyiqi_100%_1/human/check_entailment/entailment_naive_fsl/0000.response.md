Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for each possible length of the tandem repeat (from n/2 to 1). For each length, it checks if there is a substring of that length that is a tandem repeat by comparing characters at the same position in the first and second half of the substring. If it finds such a substring, it prints the length of the substring (which is twice the length of the tandem repeat) and returns.

The program handles the case where there are question marks in the string by treating them as wildcards that can match any character. This is correct because the problem statement allows replacing question marks with any lowercase Latin letter.

The program also handles the case where there are no tandem repeats in the string by printing 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
