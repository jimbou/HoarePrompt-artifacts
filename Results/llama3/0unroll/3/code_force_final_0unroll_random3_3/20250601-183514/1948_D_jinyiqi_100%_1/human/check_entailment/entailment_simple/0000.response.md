Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the input string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.
3. The program then iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from `n // 2` down to 1, where `n` is the length of the input string.
4. For each possible length `j`, it checks if there is a substring of length `2 * j` that is a tandem repeat by comparing characters at positions `k` and `k + j`. If a character is a question mark, it is considered a match.
5. If a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` is found, the program prints the length of the repeat and returns.
6. If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the program prints 0.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string has no tandem repeats by printing 0. It also correctly handles the case where the input string has a tandem repeat by printing the length of the longest repeat.

Correctness: **True**
