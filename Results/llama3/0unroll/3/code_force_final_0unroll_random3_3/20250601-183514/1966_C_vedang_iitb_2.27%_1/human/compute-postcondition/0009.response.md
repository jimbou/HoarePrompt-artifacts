Output State: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` is the length of the list `a`. The length of the list `a` is more than 1 and not equal to 2, `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, but a new variable `winNext` is introduced, which is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2` when called with the arguments `a[1:]` (the list `a` without its first element) and `n - 1`. The length of the list `a` is still more than 1 and not equal to 2.
