Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of unique pile sizes. This is a crucial step in determining the outcome of the game, as it allows us to analyze the parity of the pile sizes.

2. Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the list of differences calculated by Function 1. It uses a recursive approach to consider the outcome of the game for the remaining piles after the first move.

3. The main program correctly calls Function 1 to calculate the differences and then calls Function 2 to determine the outcome of the game. It prints "Alice" if Function 2 returns 1 (indicating that Alice can win) and "Bob" otherwise.

4. The program handles the base cases correctly: if there is only one pile, Alice can always win (Function 2 returns 1). If there are two piles, Alice can win if the first pile is even (Function 2 returns 1).

5. The recursive approach in Function 2 is correct: it considers the outcome of the game for the remaining piles after the first move and returns 1 if Alice can win, and 2 otherwise.

6. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical flaws that would affect its correctness.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
