Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the function `func_2(a, n)`. This function is supposed to determine the winner of the game based on the current state of the piles. However, it does not correctly handle the case when the smallest pile has only one stone.

In the problem description, it is stated that a player can remove at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile. However, in the function `func_2(a, n)`, it is assumed that a player can only remove one stone from each pile. This is incorrect, as a player can remove more than one stone from each pile if the smallest pile has more than one stone.

For example, consider the case when the piles are [2, 2, 2]. According to the problem description, Alice can win by removing 2 stones from each pile on her first turn. However, the function `func_2(a, n)` would incorrectly determine that Bob wins.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic, and its correctness is **False**.
