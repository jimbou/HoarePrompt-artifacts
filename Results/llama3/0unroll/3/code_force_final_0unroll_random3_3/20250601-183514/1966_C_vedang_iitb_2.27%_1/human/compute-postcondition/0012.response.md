Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of non-negative integers and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` is the length of the list `a`. The length of the list `a` is more than 1 and not equal to 2, `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`. `winNext` is not equal to 2 and if `winNext` is 1, then `a[0]` is equal to 1***
