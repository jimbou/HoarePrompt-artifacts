Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game played on n piles of stones, where players take turns removing k stones from each nonempty pile. The program uses two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Func_1 takes a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and calculates the difference between each element and its previous element. This function effectively transforms the input list into a new list containing the differences between consecutive elements.

Func_2 determines the outcome of the game based on the transformed list and its length. It uses a recursive approach to consider the parity of the first element in the list and the outcome of a recursive call on the rest of the list.

The main program iterates over the test cases, applies func_1 to the input list, and then uses func_2 to determine the winner of the game. If func_2 returns 1, the program prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Bob".

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program appears to be correct. The transformation applied by func_1 is consistent with the problem description, and func_2 correctly determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list.

Correctness: **True**
