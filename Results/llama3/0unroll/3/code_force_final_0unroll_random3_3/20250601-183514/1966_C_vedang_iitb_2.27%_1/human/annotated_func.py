#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile.

    #State: Output State: a_new is a list of positive integers where each element at index i (i > 0) is the difference between the element at index i in a_new and the element at index i - 1 in a_new, a is a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, a_temp is a sorted list of unique positive integers from a.

    #The program returns a list of positive integers where each element at index i (i > 0) is the difference between the element at index i in the returned list and the element at index i - 1 in the returned list, the returned list is derived from a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers representing the number of stones in each pile, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and then calculates the difference between each element and its previous element (for elements at index i > 0). The function returns a new list containing these differences, while leaving the original list of stones unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers and n is a non-negative integer such that n is the length of the list a.
    if (n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the number 1.
    else :
        if (n == 2) :
            if (a[0] % 2 == 0) :
                return 1
                #The program returns the number 1.
            else :
                return 2
                #The program returns the number 2.
        else :
            winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
            if (winNext == 2 or winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1) :
                return 1
                #The program returns 1
            else :
                return 2
                #The program returns 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the outcome of a game based on a list of non-negative integers and its length. It returns 1 if the game can be won, and 2 if it cannot. The function considers the parity of the first element in the list and the outcome of a recursive call on the rest of the list. If the list has only one element, the function returns 1. If the list has two elements, the function returns 1 if the first element is even, and 2 if it is odd. For lists with more than two elements, the function returns 1 if the next move would lead to a winning state or if the first element is not 1, and 2 otherwise.
