Postcondition: **`a` is a list of non-negative integers and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n` is the length of the list `a`. The length of the list `a` is more than 1 and not equal to 2. The current value of `winNext` is either 2 or 1, and if `winNext` is 1, then the first element of `a` is not 1. Additionally, `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**
