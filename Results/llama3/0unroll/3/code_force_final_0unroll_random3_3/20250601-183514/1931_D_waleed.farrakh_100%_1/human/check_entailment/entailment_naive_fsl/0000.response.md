Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array a, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a frequency map (freq) to store the count of each pair of remainders (rx, ry) when divided by x and y, respectively. It then iterates through the array, calculates the remainders for each element, and checks if the corresponding pair (rx, ry) is present in the frequency map. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When x and y are equal
* When x and y are different
* When the array contains duplicate elements
* When the array contains elements that are divisible by both x and y

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the array is empty or when x or y is 1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
