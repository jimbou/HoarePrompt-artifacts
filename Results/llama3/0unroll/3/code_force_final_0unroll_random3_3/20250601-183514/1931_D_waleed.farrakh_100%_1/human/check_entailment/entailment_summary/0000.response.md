Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

func_2 reads the input from the console, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results to the console.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that func_1 correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in each test case. func_2 correctly reads the input, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to process the test cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
