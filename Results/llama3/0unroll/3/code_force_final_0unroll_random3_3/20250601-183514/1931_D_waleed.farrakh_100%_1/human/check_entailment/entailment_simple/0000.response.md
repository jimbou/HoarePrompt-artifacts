Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the problem description. 

The program first reads the input and stores it in the `test_cases` list. Then, it iterates over each test case and for each test case, it iterates over each element in the array. For each element, it calculates the remainder when the element is divided by `x` and `y`, and uses these remainders to find the number of pairs that satisfy the given conditions. 

The program uses a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each pair of remainders. It then checks if the pair of remainders corresponding to the current element is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs by the frequency of that pair. 

Finally, the program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and returns it. The main function then prints each result.

Correctness: **True**
