Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is 0, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer greater than or equal to 2*t, results is returned by func_1(test_cases)**

The code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `test_cases` and assigns the returned value to the variable `results`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, so we cannot determine the exact value of `results`. However, we can conclude that `results` is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.
