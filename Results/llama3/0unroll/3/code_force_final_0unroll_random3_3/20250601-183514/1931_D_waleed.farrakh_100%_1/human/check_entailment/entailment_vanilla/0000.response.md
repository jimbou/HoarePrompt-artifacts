Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The given program uses a frequency map (dictionary) to store the count of elements in the array modulo x and modulo y. It then iterates through the array, for each element, it calculates the corresponding pair (rx, ry) that would make a beautiful pair with the current element. If this pair is already in the frequency map, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

The program correctly handles the case where x or y is 1, as the modulo operation is correctly handled.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate elements, as the frequency map stores the count of each element modulo x and modulo y.

The program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the array, as it iterates through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, the frequency map will store n elements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
