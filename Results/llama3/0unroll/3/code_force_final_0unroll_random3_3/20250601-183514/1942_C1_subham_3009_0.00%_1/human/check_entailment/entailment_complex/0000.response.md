Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices in a regular polygon with n sides. The given program simply prints the value of x minus 2 for each test case, where x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

However, the problem statement does not provide any mathematical reasoning or formula to support the claim that the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake is always x - 2. In fact, the problem statement suggests that the number of triangular pieces of cake depends on the arrangement of the chosen vertices, not just the number of vertices.

Moreover, the program does not take into account the arrangement of the chosen vertices or the number of sides of the polygon (n). It simply prints a fixed value based on the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

Therefore, the program is not correct, as it does not provide a valid solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
