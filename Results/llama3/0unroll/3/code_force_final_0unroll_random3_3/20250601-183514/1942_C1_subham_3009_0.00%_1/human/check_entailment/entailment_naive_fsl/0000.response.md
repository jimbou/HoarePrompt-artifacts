Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x) is less than or equal to 2. In this case, the program will print x - 2, which can be negative or zero, but the problem statement requires the output to be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake, which is at least 0.

For example, if the input is:

3
4 2 0
1 3

The program will output -1, but the correct output should be 0, because no triangular pieces of cake can be formed with only 2 vertices.

The program assumes that x is always greater than or equal to 3, but this is not guaranteed by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
