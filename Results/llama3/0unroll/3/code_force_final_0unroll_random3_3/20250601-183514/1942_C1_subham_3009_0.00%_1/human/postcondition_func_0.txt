The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) followed by x distinct integers. It then prints the value of x minus 2 for each test case. The function does not modify the input values or perform any calculations beyond the subtraction. The output is solely dependent on the value of x in each test case.
