Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing no more than y other vertices, given that Bessie has already chosen x vertices. However, since y = 0, we cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed is simply the number of vertices Bessie has already chosen minus 2, because each triangle requires 3 vertices.

The given program correctly implements this logic by printing x - 2 for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
