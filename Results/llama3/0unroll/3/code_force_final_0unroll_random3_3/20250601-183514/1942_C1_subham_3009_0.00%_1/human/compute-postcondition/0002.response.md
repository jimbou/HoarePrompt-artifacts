Output State: **The output state is the number of test cases minus two, printed for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state is the result of subtracting two from the number of test cases, which is then printed for each test case. The loop iterates over each test case, reads the input, and prints the result of the subtraction. The output state is the collection of these printed results, one for each test case.
