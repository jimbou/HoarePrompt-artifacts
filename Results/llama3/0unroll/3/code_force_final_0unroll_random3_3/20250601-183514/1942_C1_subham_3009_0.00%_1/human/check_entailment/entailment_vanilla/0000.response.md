Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. The given program simply prints `x - 2` for each test case, where `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

The key insight here is that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake is equal to the number of vertices Bessie has chosen minus 2. This is because each triangle requires 3 vertices, and we can always form `x - 2` triangles by connecting the vertices in a specific order.

For example, if Bessie has chosen 4 vertices, we can form 2 triangles by connecting the vertices in the order 1-2-3 and 2-3-4. Similarly, if Bessie has chosen 8 vertices, we can form 6 triangles by connecting the vertices in the order 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6, 5-6-7, and 6-7-8.

The given program correctly implements this insight by simply printing `x - 2` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
