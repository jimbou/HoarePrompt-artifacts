Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y, where 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2*10^5), and y = 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The program is running as the main module.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer from the input, and there are still `t` test cases left in the stdin. Each test case still consists of two lines, with the first line containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line containing `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The program is still running as the main module.
