Functionality: **This function takes two integers x and n as input and returns the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n. It reads input from stdin, where the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) representing the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of integers x and n (1 <= x <= 10^8 and 1 <= n <= x). The function iterates through all divisors of x, updates the maximum divisor that is less than or equal to n, and prints the result.**
