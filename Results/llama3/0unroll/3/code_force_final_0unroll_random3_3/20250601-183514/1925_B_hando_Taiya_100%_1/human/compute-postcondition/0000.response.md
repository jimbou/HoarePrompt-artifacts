The first line assigns to `x` and `n` a pair of integers from stdin. Stdin now contains t inputs: t pairs of integers. The second line assigns the value 0 to `ans`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 0, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers.**
