#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5), then a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and does not perform any actions. It simply returns 0, indicating successful execution. The state of the program remains unchanged after the function concludes.
