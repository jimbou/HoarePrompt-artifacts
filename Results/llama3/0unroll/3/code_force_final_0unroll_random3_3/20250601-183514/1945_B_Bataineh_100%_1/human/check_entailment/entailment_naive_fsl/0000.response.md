Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases based on the relationship between the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) and the frequencies of launching for the first and second installations (a and b).

Here's a breakdown of the cases:

1. If m < a and m < b, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2, because each installation launches fireworks at a frequency that is greater than the time the firework is visible in the sky.

2. If m < a and m > b, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2 + m // b, because the first installation launches fireworks at a frequency that is greater than the time the firework is visible in the sky, but the second installation launches fireworks at a frequency that is less than or equal to the time the firework is visible in the sky.

3. If m < b and m > a, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2 + m // a, because the second installation launches fireworks at a frequency that is greater than the time the firework is visible in the sky, but the first installation launches fireworks at a frequency that is less than or equal to the time the firework is visible in the sky.

4. If m >= a and m >= b, then the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is m // a + m // b + 2, because both installations launch fireworks at frequencies that are less than or equal to the time the firework is visible in the sky.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously for each of these cases.
