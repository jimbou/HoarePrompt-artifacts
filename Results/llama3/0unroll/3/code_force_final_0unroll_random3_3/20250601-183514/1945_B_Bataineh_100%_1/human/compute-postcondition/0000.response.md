Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m, where a, b, and m are between 1 and 10^18.
