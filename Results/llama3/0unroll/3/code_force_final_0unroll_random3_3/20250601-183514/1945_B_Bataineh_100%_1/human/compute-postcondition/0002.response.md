Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make a and b equal to m, considering all possible cases where m is less than, greater than, or equal to a and b. The function outputs the results for each test case on a new line, with the number of operations being the sum of divisions of m by a and b, plus 2, depending on the relative values of a, b, and m.**
