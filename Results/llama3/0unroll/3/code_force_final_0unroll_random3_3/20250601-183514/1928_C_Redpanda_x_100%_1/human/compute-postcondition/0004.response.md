Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the state of the variables has changed as follows: the variable factor has taken on all values in the list rest, the variable prime_to_i has been multiplied by the kth prime number in the list primes (prime) a total of factors[prime] + 1 times, and the yield statement has produced a sequence of values that are the product of factor and prime_to_i in each iteration. The values of k, primes, factors, rest, and prime remain unchanged.**
