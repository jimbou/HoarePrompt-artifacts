Postcondition: ***k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers. If k is equal to the number of elements in the list primes, the value 1 is yielded. Otherwise, the loop has finished executing all iterations, and the state of the variables has changed as follows: the variable factor has taken on all values in the list rest, the variable prime_to_i has been multiplied by the kth prime number in the list primes (prime) a total of factors[prime] + 1 times, and the yield statement has produced a sequence of values that are the product of factor and prime_to_i in each iteration. The values of k, primes, factors, rest, and prime remain unchanged.***
