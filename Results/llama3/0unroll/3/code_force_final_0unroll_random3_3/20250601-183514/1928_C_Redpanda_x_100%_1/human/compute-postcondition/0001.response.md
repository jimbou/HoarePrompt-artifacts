The code `yield 1` is a generator expression that produces a value of 1. This means that the execution of the code will pause at this point and return the value 1.

Since the initial state specifies that k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, and factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, and the current value of k is equal to the number of elements in the list primes, the output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of the yielded value.

Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are non-negative integers, the current value of k is equal to the number of elements in the list primes, and the value 1 is yielded.**
