Generates a sequence of values based on the input parameters k, primes, and factors. If k is equal to the number of elements in the list primes, the function yields the value 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates a sequence of values by multiplying each value in the sequence generated by the recursive call with the kth prime number in the list primes, raised to a power from 0 to the value of the kth prime number in the dictionary factors. The function yields each product in the sequence.
