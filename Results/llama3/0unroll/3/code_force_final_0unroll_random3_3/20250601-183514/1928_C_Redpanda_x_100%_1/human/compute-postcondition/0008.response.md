Functionality: **This function takes a positive integer n greater than 1 as input and returns a generator that produces prime factors of n. The function first calculates the prime factors of n and their respective powers, then enters an infinite loop, yielding values produced by the generate(0) function. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it will continue to produce values indefinitely, without modifying the calculated prime factors or their powers.**
