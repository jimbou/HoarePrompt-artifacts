stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) representing a beautiful array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
