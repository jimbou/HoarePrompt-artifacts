Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, reads the input array, and checks if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful.

If the array contains different elements, the program initializes a variable `cnt` to count the consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp`. It then iterates through the array, updating `cnt` whenever it encounters a different element. The minimum count of consecutive occurrences is stored in the variable `ans`.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. For example, if the input array contains only one unique element, it correctly prints -1. If the array contains multiple unique elements, it correctly calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. In the line `ans = min(ans, cnt)`, the program updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences. However, this update is done after the loop iterates through the entire array. If the last element of the array is the same as the first element `tmp`, the `cnt` variable will not be updated correctly, and the minimum count will not be calculated correctly.

To fix this issue, the program should update `ans` inside the loop, whenever it encounters a different element. This ensures that the minimum count is calculated correctly, even if the last element of the array is the same as the first element `tmp`.

Correctness: **False**
