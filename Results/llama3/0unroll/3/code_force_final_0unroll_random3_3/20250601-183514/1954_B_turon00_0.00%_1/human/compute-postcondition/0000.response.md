Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) representing a beautiful array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The rest of the input remains the same, with each test case consisting of two lines: the first line containing an integer `n` and the second line containing `n` integers representing a beautiful array.
