Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through each test case, reading the size of the array and the array itself. It then checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If not all elements are the same, it initializes a variable `cnt` to keep track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array. It then iterates through the array, incrementing `cnt` whenever it encounters the first element and resetting `cnt` whenever it encounters a different element. It keeps track of the minimum count seen so far in the variable `ans`.

Finally, it prints the minimum count `ans`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
