You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) representing a beautiful array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        aa = set(a)
        
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer between 1 and 10^4. The variable `n` has been updated to the last value read from the input, which is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. The variable `a` has been updated to the last list of integers read from the input, where each integer is between 1 and `n`. The variable `tmp` has been updated to the first element of the last list `a`. The variable `aa` has been updated to a set containing all unique elements from the last list `a`. The variable `cnt` has been updated to the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp` in the last list `a`. The variable `ans` has been updated to the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the last list `a`. The output of the loop is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in each list `a` for all iterations.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
