Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

3. It then checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If all elements are the same, it prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

4. If not all elements are the same, it initializes a variable `cnt` to 0 and `ans` to `n`. It then iterates over the array, incrementing `cnt` whenever it encounters the first element `tmp`. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

5. After the loop, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` one last time to account for the last sequence of `tmp` elements.

6. Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all edge cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
