Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array contains only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. In this case, the program will output the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element, but it should output 1, because removing any one element will make the array not beautiful.

For example, for the input:

5
1 2 1 2 1

The program will output 2, but the correct output is 1.
