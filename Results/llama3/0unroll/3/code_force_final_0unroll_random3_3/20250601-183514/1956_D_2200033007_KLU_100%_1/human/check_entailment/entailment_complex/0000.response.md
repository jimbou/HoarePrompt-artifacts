Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program uses a recursive approach with memoization to find the maximum sum of the elements of the array a. The function func_1 calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by performing certain operations on a subarray of a given array. The function func_2 takes a subarray of a given array arr defined by start_index and end_index as input and returns a list of tuples representing the indices of subarrays that satisfy certain conditions. The function make_stairs transforms a given list of integers into a "staircase" structure by modifying the list in-place and appending tuples to a result list.

Correctness: **True**
