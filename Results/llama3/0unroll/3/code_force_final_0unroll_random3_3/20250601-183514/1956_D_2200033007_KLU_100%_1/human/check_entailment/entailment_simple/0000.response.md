Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, computing x as MEX({a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}), and simultaneously setting a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x.

The program uses a recursive approach with memoization to find the maximum sum of elements in the array. The function func_1 calculates the maximum sum of elements in the subarray from start_index to end_index, and the function func_2 constructs the sequence of operations to achieve this maximum sum.

The program correctly handles the base cases for func_1 and func_2, and it correctly calculates the maximum sum of elements in the subarray. The program also correctly constructs the sequence of operations to achieve this maximum sum.

However, there are a few potential issues with the program. The function make_stairs is not defined in the given code, which could cause an error when the program is run. Additionally, the program does not check if the input array is valid (i.e., if it contains only non-negative integers), which could cause an error if the input array is invalid.

Despite these potential issues, the program appears to be correct in terms of its logic and approach to solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
