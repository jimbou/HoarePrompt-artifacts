Output State: **i is 0, arr is a list of integers where arr[start_index] is 1, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers where the last element is (start_index, start_index), and is_already_stairs is False. There exists a j in the range [0, i] such that arr[start_index + j] != j**

Explanation:
The first line appends a tuple (start_index, start_index) to the list res. The second line assigns the value 1 to the element at index start_index in the list arr. The value of i remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of is_already_stairs also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The condition "There exists a j in the range [0, i] such that arr[start_index + j] != j" remains valid, as the code does not modify the values of i or the elements of arr at indices other than start_index.
