You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, and res is a list of tuples of non-negative integers.
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False if there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`, otherwise `is_already_stairs` is True.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. There exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. There exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. `i` is larger than 0
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers such that `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + 1]` is equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + 2]` is equal to `i`, ..., `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer larger than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i-1]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`, the current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i-1`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list of integers such that `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + 1]` is equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + 2]` is equal to `i`, ..., `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
