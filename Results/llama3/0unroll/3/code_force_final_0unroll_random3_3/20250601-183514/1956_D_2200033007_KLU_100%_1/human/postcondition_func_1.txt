This function takes a subarray of a given array `arr` defined by `start_index` and `end_index` as input and returns a list of tuples representing the indices of subarrays that satisfy certain conditions. If the subarray has only one element and it is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list. If the maximum value of the subarray is equal to the square of its length, the function returns a list containing a tuple of the start and end indices of the subarray. Otherwise, the function iterates over the subarray and checks if the sum of the values of the current element and the maximum values of the subarrays on its left and right is equal to the maximum value of the subarray. If such an element is found, the function returns the sum of the results of another function `func_2` called on the subarrays on the left and right of the current element. If no such element is found, the function returns the result of `func_2` called on the subarray excluding the first or last element, depending on which one has a value closer to the maximum value. If none of these conditions are met, the function implicitly returns None.
