Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers. The current value of `is_already_stairs` is True, indicating that for all `j` in the range `[0, i]`, `arr[start_index + j]` equals `j`***
