Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer larger than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i-1]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`, the current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i-1`. Otherwise, `arr` is a list of integers such that `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + 1]` is equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + 2]` is equal to `i`, ..., `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`.***
