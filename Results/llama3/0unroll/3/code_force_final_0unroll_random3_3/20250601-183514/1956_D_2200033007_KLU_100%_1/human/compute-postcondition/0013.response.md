Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. There exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. `i` is larger than 0. `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.**

The code snippet modifies the `res` list by appending a new tuple containing `start_index` and `start_index + i`. The `make_stairs(i - 1)` function call is not defined in the provided code, so its effect on the state is unknown. However, since `i` is larger than 0, `i - 1` is a non-negative integer, and the function call does not affect the values of `arr`, `start_index`, or `is_already_stairs`. The existence of a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j` and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` remains valid after the code execution.
