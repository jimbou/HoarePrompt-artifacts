Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. Function 1 (`func_1`): This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by performing certain operations on a subarray of a given array. It uses memoization to store the results of subproblems and considers three cases: (1) if the subarray has only one element, it returns the maximum of 1 and the value of that element; (2) if the subarray has more than one element, it calculates the maximum value by considering all possible ways to split the subarray into two parts and recursively calculating the maximum value for each part; (3) if the subarray has already been processed, it returns the stored result. This function is correct based on the problem description, which asks to maximize the sum of the elements of the array.

2. Function 2 (`func_2`): This function takes a subarray of a given array `arr` defined by `start_index` and `end_index` as input and returns a list of tuples representing the indices of subarrays that satisfy certain conditions. If the subarray has only one element and it is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list. If the maximum value of the subarray is equal to the square of its length, the function returns a list containing a tuple of the start and end indices of the subarray. Otherwise, the function iterates over the subarray and checks if the sum of the values of the current element and the maximum values of the subarrays on its left and right is equal to the maximum value of the subarray. If such an element is found, the function returns the sum of the results of another function `func_2` called on the subarrays on the left and right of the current element. If no such element is found, the function returns the result of `func_2` called on the subarray excluding the first or last element, depending on which one has a value closer to the maximum value. This function is correct based on the problem description, which asks to construct a sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.

3. Function 3 (`make_stairs`): This function transforms a given list of integers into a "staircase" structure by modifying the list in-place and appending tuples to a result list. It takes a non-negative integer `i`, a list of integers `arr`, a non-negative integer `start_index`, and a list of tuples `res` as input. The function checks if the sublist of `arr` starting from `start_index` with length `i+1` is already a staircase (i.e., each element is equal to its index). If it is, the function returns without modifying the list. If not, it recursively calls itself with `i-1` and modifies the sublist to create a staircase structure by setting all elements to `i`. The function also appends tuples to the result list `res` to track the modifications. This function is correct based on the problem description, which asks to perform operations on the array to maximize its sum.

The main program calls `func_1` to calculate the maximum value that can be obtained, and then calls `func_2` to construct a sequence of operations that achieves this maximum value. The program then prints the maximum value and the sequence of operations. Based on the execution summaries, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
