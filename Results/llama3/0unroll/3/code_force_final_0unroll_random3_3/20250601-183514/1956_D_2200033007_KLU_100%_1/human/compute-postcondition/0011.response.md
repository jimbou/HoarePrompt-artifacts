Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer larger than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. There exists a `j` in the range `[0, i-1]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. The current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`. The function `make_stairs` has been called with the argument `i-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, and the function `make_stairs` has been called with the new value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j` is still valid, but the range has been updated to `[0, i-1]`. The current value of `arr[start_index + i]` is no longer equal to `i`, but the current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`.
