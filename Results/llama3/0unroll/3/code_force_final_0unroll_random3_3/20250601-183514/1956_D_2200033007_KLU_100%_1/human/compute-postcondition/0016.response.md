Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that `arr[start_index]` is equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + 1]` is equal to `i`, `arr[start_index + 2]` is equal to `i`, ..., `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`.**

The code calls the function `make_stairs` with the argument `i - 1`. This means that the function will be executed with the value of `i` decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all equal to `i`. After the function call, the value of `i` is effectively decremented by 1, so the range of indices in `arr` that are equal to `i` will be reduced by 1. Therefore, the output state is that `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i - 1]` are all equal to `i - 1`.
