Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the operation to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a. The problem description states that the operation can be performed no more than 5*10^5 times, but the program does not keep track of the number of operations performed. 

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle the case when the maximum sum is achieved by not performing any operations. In this case, the program should return 0 as the number of operations, but it does not.

For example, if the input is [1, 3, 9], the maximum sum is 13, which is achieved without performing any operations. However, the program does not correctly handle this case and does not return 0 as the number of operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
