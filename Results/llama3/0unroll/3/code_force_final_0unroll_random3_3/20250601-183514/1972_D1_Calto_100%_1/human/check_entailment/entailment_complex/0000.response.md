Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, which is a crucial component in determining whether a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Function 2 calculates the sum of the ceiling of `(n - i^2 + i) / i^2` and a boolean value indicating whether `(n - i^2 + i)` is divisible by `i^2`, for all `i` from 1 to `m`. This calculation seems to be related to the condition a+b being a multiple of b * gcd(a, b), but it is not immediately clear how it achieves this.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that Function 2 is using a clever mathematical trick to count the number of valid pairs. The expression `(n - i^2 + i) / i^2` is equivalent to `(n - i(i-1)) / i^2`, which can be rewritten as `(n/i^2) - (i-1)/i`. This expression is counting the number of multiples of `i^2` that are less than or equal to `n`, which is equivalent to counting the number of valid pairs (a, b) where `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

The use of `math.ceil` and the boolean value `(x % y == 0)` ensures that the count is accurate, even when `n` is not a multiple of `i^2`.

Therefore, based on the provided execution states and the problem description, it appears that the given program is correct.
