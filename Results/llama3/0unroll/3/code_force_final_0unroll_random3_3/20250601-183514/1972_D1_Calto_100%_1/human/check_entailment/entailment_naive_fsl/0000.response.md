Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program uses two functions to solve the problem. The first function, `func_1`, calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The second function, `func_2`, calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The key insight in the program is that the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` can be rewritten as `a+b = k * b * gcd(a,b)` for some integer `k`. This implies that `a = k * b * gcd(a,b) - b`, which can be further simplified to `a = (k * gcd(a,b) - 1) * b`.

The program uses this insight to iterate over all possible values of `i` (which represents `gcd(a,b)`) and calculates the corresponding value of `a` using the formula above. The `math.ceil` function is used to calculate the ceiling of the division, which ensures that the result is an integer.

The program also uses the fact that `a` must be less than or equal to `n`, which is used to limit the range of the iteration.

After carefully examining the program, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and it correctly uses the insight above to calculate the number of ordered pairs satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
