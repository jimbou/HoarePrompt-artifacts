Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

`func_2` calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given n and m. It iterates over all possible values of i from 1 to m, and for each i, it calculates the range of valid values for a. The range is determined by the conditions:

* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)
* 1 ≤ a ≤ n

The program uses the formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` to calculate the upper bound of the range, and `y = i * i` to calculate the step size. The `math.ceil` function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer.

The program then adds the number of valid pairs for each i to the total count.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the mathematical formula for calculating the number of valid pairs. The use of the `math.ceil` function ensures that the result is rounded up to the nearest integer, which is necessary to include all valid pairs.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. The initial value of `cnt` is set to -1, which means that the first iteration of the loop will add 1 to the count, even if there are no valid pairs for i = 1. This will result in an incorrect count.

To fix this, the initial value of `cnt` should be set to 0.

Correctness: **False**
