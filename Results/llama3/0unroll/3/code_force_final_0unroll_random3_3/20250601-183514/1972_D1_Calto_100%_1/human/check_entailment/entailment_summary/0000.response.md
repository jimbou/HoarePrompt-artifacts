Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

Function 1 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers, which is a crucial component in determining whether a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b).

Function 2 calculates the sum of the ceiling of `(n - i^2 + i) / i^2` and a boolean value indicating whether `(n - i^2 + i)` is divisible by `i^2`, for all `i` from 1 to `m`. This function seems to be related to the condition a+b being a multiple of b * gcd(a,b), but it's not immediately clear how it achieves this.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the expression `(n - i^2 + i) / i^2` is equivalent to `(n - i + 1) / i^2`, which can be rewritten as `n/i^2 - (i-1)/i^2`. This expression is related to the number of multiples of `i^2` in the range `[1, n]`, which is a key component in determining the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

Moreover, the use of `math.ceil` and the addition of a boolean value indicating whether `(n - i^2 + i)` is divisible by `i^2` suggests that Function 2 is indeed calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

Therefore, based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that Function 1 and Function 2 together correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.
