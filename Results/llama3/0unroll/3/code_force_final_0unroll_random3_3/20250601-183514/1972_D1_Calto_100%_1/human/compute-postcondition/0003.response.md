Output State: **The program returns the sum of the ceiling of `(n - i^2 + i) / i^2` and a boolean value indicating whether `(n - i^2 + i)` is divisible by `i^2`, for all `i` from 1 to `m`.**

In this output state, `cnt` is a value that represents the cumulative sum of two components: 

1. The ceiling of `(n - i^2 + i) / i^2`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the result of the division. This value is calculated for each `i` from 1 to `m`.

2. A boolean value indicating whether `(n - i^2 + i)` is divisible by `i^2`. This boolean value is likely represented as 0 (False) or 1 (True), and is added to the sum for each `i`.

The final value of `cnt` is the sum of these two components for all `i` from 1 to `m`.
