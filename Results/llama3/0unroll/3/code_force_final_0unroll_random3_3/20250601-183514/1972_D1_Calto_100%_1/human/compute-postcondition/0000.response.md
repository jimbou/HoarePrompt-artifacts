Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `cnt` is -1.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The code only introduces a new variable `cnt` and assigns it the value -1. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, and the new variable `cnt` with its assigned value.
