Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of unique integers from the original list in descending order, counter is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original list, cur is 0, cnt is the number of duplicate integers in the original list, ans is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The list `a` now contains unique integers from the original list, sorted in descending order. The `counter` dictionary stores the frequency of each integer in the original list. The variable `cur` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` is calculated as the difference between the original length of `a` (which is `n`) and the length of the new `a` after removing duplicates, representing the number of duplicate integers in the original list. The list `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The state of `stdin` is not affected by the code, so it still contains multiple test cases minus one.
