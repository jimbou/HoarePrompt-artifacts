Reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it increments each integer by its 1-based index, removes duplicates, and sorts the list in descending order. Then, it fills in the gaps between consecutive integers with missing numbers, and finally appends additional unique integers to the end of the list, which are one less than the last integer in the list. The resulting list of unique integers is printed in descending order.
