Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads two lines from stdin for each test case. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `a`. After executing the code, `n` and `a` are updated with new values, and stdin contains one less test case.
