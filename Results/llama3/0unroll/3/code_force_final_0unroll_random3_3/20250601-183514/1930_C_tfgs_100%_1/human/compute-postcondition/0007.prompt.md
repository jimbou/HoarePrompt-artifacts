Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop iterates over the list 'a' and for each element, it calculates the difference between the current element and the previous one, and appends the missing numbers in the range to the 'ans' list. It also updates the 'cnt' and 'cur' variables based on the frequency of the current element in the 'counter' dictionary. After the loop finishes, the 'ans' list contains all the unique integers from the original list in descending order, along with the missing numbers in the ranges between consecutive elements. The 'cnt' variable is updated to reflect the number of duplicate integers in the original list that were not included in the 'ans' list. The 'cur' variable is updated to reflect the total count of integers in the 'ans' list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
