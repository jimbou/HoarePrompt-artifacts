    #State: The output state is a series of time conversions from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM indicator. For each input time in the format "hh:mm", the output will be in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" where "hh" is the hour in 12-hour format, "mm" is the minute, and "AM/PM" is the time of day indicator. The number of output lines will be equal to the number of input lines (t).

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a series of 24-hour time inputs to 12-hour format with AM/PM indicator and prints the results.
