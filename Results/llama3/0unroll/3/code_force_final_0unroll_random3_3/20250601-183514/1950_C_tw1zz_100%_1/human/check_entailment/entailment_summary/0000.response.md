Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program takes a series of 24-hour time inputs, converts them to 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator, and prints the results. The program handles all possible 24-hour time inputs from 00:00 to 23:59 and correctly converts them to their 12-hour equivalents. The use of if-elif-else statements to determine the 12-hour equivalent and AM/PM indicator is correct and efficient. The program's output matches the expected output as shown in the example.

Correctness: **True**
