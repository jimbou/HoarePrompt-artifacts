Reasoning:

1. The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and clears the console screen using `os.system('cls')`.

3. It then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

4. For each test case, it reads the number of special characters `n` and checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have a string with only one special character.

5. If `n` is not 1, it initializes an empty string `ans` and a counter `x` to 0.

6. If `n` is even, it generates a string with `n/2` pairs of identical characters. For example, if `n` is 6, it generates the string 'AAABBB'.

7. If `n` is odd, it starts with the string 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then generates `(n-3)/2` pairs of identical characters. For example, if `n` is 7, it generates the string 'AAABBB'.

8. Finally, it prints 'YES' followed by the generated string.

9. The program does not handle invalid inputs, but the problem statement assumes valid inputs.

10. The program does not check if the generated string has exactly `n` special characters, but the construction of the string ensures that it does.

11. The program does not check if the generated string is of length at most 200, but the construction of the string ensures that it is.

Correctness: **True**
