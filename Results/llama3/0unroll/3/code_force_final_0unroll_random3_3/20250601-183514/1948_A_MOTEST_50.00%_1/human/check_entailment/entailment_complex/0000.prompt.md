Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
import os
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 50) and then t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state is a series of strings, each representing a possible arrangement of uppercase ASCII letters. The number of strings is equal to the number of lines in the input, and each string is either 'NO' or a sequence of uppercase letters. If the input number is 1, the output is 'NO'. If the input number is even, the output is a sequence of uppercase letters where each letter appears twice. If the input number is odd, the output starts with 'AAA' and then follows the same pattern as the even case. The sequence of uppercase letters is determined by the ASCII order of the letters.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of integers from standard input, generates and prints a corresponding series of strings, each representing a possible arrangement of uppercase ASCII letters. For each input integer, if it is 1, the function prints 'NO'. If the input integer is even, the function prints a sequence of uppercase letters where each letter appears twice, in ASCII order. If the input integer is odd, the function prints a sequence starting with 'AAA' followed by the same pattern as the even case. The function processes multiple input integers and prints the corresponding output strings.
