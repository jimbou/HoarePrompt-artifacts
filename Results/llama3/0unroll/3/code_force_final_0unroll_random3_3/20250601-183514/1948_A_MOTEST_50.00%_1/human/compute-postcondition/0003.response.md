Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, generates and prints a corresponding series of strings, each representing a possible arrangement of uppercase ASCII letters. For each input integer, if it is 1, the function prints 'NO'. If the input integer is even, the function prints a sequence of uppercase letters where each letter appears twice, in ASCII order. If the input integer is odd, the function prints a sequence starting with 'AAA' followed by the same pattern as the even case. The function processes multiple input integers and prints the corresponding output strings.**
