Output State: **The output state is a series of strings, each representing a possible arrangement of uppercase ASCII letters. The number of strings is equal to the number of lines in the input, and each string is either 'NO' or a sequence of uppercase letters. If the input number is 1, the output is 'NO'. If the input number is even, the output is a sequence of uppercase letters where each letter appears twice. If the input number is odd, the output starts with 'AAA' and then follows the same pattern as the even case. The sequence of uppercase letters is determined by the ASCII order of the letters.**
