Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases. It checks if the input number `n` is 1, in which case it prints "NO" because there is no suitable string with exactly 1 special character. For all other cases, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating characters from the uppercase Latin alphabet. The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly, and it ensures that the constructed string has a length of at most 200. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.
