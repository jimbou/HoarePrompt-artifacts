The code `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. 

Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9), the value of `n_cases` will be the first integer t.

The remaining input in stdin will be t lines each containing an integer n.

Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9).**
