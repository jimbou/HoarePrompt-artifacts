Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents a value 'n'. For each 'n', the function calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 'n'. If 'n' is 1, it prints 1. If 'n' is a power of 2, it prints 'n'. Otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 less than 'n'. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results accordingly.**
