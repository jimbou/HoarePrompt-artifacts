Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly identifies consecutive sequences of the same integer in the input list and stores them in a list of tuples. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the corresponding sequence and prints the start and end indices of the sequence that contains the query range. If no such sequence exists, it prints (-1, -1).

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query range is outside the bounds of the input list or when the query range is within a single sequence of the same integer. The program also handles the case when the input list contains only one distinct integer.

The use of binary search to find the corresponding sequence for each query is efficient, with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of sequences. The overall time complexity of the program is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input list.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
