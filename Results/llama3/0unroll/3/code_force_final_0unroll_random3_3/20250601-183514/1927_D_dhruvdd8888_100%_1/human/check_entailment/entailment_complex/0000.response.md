Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in a given array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program uses a clever approach by first identifying consecutive sequences of the same integer in the array and storing these sequences in a list of tuples. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the corresponding sequence and prints the start and end indices of the sequence that contains the query range.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases:

1.  If the query range is within a single sequence of the same integer, it correctly prints (-1, -1) because there are no two different elements in that range.
2.  If the query range spans multiple sequences, it correctly prints the start and end indices of the sequence that contains the query range.
3.  If the query range is outside the array bounds, it correctly prints (-1, -1).

The program also uses efficient algorithms, such as binary search, to achieve a good time complexity.

Correctness: **True**
