stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) — the length of the array a, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) — the elements of the array a, followed by a single integer q (1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5) — the number of queries, followed by q lines containing two integers each, l and r (1 <= l < r <= n) — the boundaries of the query.
