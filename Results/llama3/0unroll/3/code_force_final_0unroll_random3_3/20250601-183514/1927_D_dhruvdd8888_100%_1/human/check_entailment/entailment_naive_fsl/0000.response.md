Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find a pair of different elements within a given range in the array. It uses a clever approach by grouping consecutive equal elements together and storing their start and end indices. This allows it to efficiently find a pair of different elements within a given range.

The program first reads the input and creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of a group of consecutive equal elements. It then uses binary search to find the group that contains the start index of the query range. If the start index is within the group, it checks if the end index of the group is within the query range. If it is, it returns the start index and the end index of the group. If not, it returns the start index and the index of the next group.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query range is within a single group, or when the query range spans multiple groups. It also handles the case when there is no pair of different elements within the query range.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
