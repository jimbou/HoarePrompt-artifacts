Output State: **N remains the same integer, nums remains the same list of integers with an additional -1 at the end, s is the second last index of the list of integers, e remains 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements - the first element is 1 plus the index of the previous integer in the list, the second element is the index of the current integer in the list, and the third element is the current integer in the list, LA is the last index of the list of tuples.**

In this output state, the value of LA is calculated as the last index of the list of tuples arr, which is equal to the length of arr minus 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
