You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then multiple pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list. The second integer is the number of pairs. Each pair of integers represents a query. The list of integers and the pairs of integers are separated by a newline character.
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: N remains the same integer, nums remains the same list of integers with an additional -1 at the end, s is the second last index of the list of integers, e remains 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements - the first element is 1 plus the index of the previous integer in the list, the second element is the index of the current integer in the list, and the third element is the current integer in the list.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over the input range, and for each iteration, it calculates the left and right indices (l and r) from the input. It then uses binary search to find the index of the tuple in the arr list that corresponds to the left index (eli). If the left index is greater than the second last index of the list of integers (s), it checks if the second last index is 1 or greater than the right index, and if so, prints (-1, -1). Otherwise, it prints (s - 1, s). If the end index (e) is greater than or equal to the right index, it prints (-1, -1). If the end index is less than the length of the list of integers (N) or less than the left index, it prints (s, e + 1). Otherwise, it prints (-1, -1). The loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope, so the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the same values for N, nums, s, e, num, arr, and LA.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
