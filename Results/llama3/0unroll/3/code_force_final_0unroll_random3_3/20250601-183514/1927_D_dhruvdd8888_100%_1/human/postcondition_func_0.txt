This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of integers, another integer, and multiple pairs of integers. It processes the list of integers to identify consecutive sequences of the same integer and stores these sequences in a list of tuples. Then, for each pair of integers (query), it uses binary search to find the corresponding sequence and prints the start and end indices of the sequence that contains the query range. If no such sequence exists, it prints (-1, -1). The function does not modify the input data and only prints the results for each query.
