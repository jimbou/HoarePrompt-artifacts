Output State: **N is an integer, nums is a list of integers with an additional -1 at the end, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the original list of integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and multiple pairs of integers.**

The code reads the first integer from stdin and assigns it to N, which represents the length of the list. It then reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns them to the list nums. The list nums is then modified by appending -1 to the end. The variables s and e are initialized to 0. The variable num is assigned the value of the first integer in the original list of integers. An empty list arr is created. The stdin now contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and multiple pairs of integers.
