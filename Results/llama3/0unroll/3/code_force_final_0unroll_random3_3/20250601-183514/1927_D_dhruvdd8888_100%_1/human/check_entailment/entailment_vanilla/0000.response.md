Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in a given array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program uses a technique of grouping consecutive equal elements together and storing their start and end indices in an array `arr`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `tc` and then iterating over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums` itself, and the number of queries `q`.
3.  It initializes an array `arr` to store the start and end indices of consecutive equal elements in `nums`. It also appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to simplify the logic.
4.  The program then iterates over `nums` and `arr`, grouping consecutive equal elements together. For each group, it stores the start index `s`, end index `e`, and the value of the elements in the group `num` in `arr`.
5.  After processing all elements in `nums`, the program iterates over each query. For each query, it uses binary search to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index `s` is greater than or equal to the query's left boundary `l`.
6.  Based on the value of `eli` and the corresponding start and end indices in `arr`, the program determines whether a pair of different elements exists within the query's range. If such a pair exists, it prints the indices `i` and `j`; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by grouping consecutive equal elements together and using binary search to find the relevant groups for each query.

Correctness: **True**
