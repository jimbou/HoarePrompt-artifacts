Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then multiple pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list. The second integer is the number of pairs. Each pair of integers represents a query. The list of integers and the pairs of integers are separated by a newline character.
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: N remains the same integer, nums remains the same list of integers with an additional -1 at the end, s is the second last index of the list of integers, e remains 0, num is -1, arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements - the first element is 1 plus the index of the previous integer in the list, the second element is the index of the current integer in the list, and the third element is the current integer in the list.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates over the input range, and for each iteration, it calculates the left and right indices (l and r) from the input. It then uses binary search to find the index of the tuple in the arr list that corresponds to the left index (eli). If the left index is greater than the second last index of the list of integers (s), it checks if the second last index is 1 or greater than the right index, and if so, prints (-1, -1). Otherwise, it prints (s - 1, s). If the end index (e) is greater than or equal to the right index, it prints (-1, -1). If the end index is less than the length of the list of integers (N) or less than the left index, it prints (s, e + 1). Otherwise, it prints (-1, -1). The loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope, so the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the same values for N, nums, s, e, num, arr, and LA.
