Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find the pair of different elements in the given range for each query. The program first processes the input array and creates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the start and end indices of a subarray with the same elements, along with the element itself. Then, for each query, it uses binary search to find the tuple that corresponds to the left index of the query range. Based on the start and end indices of the found tuple, it determines whether a pair of different elements exists in the query range and prints the corresponding indices.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the query range is within a subarray with the same elements, when the query range spans multiple subarrays, and when no pair of different elements exists in the query range.

Correctness: **True**
