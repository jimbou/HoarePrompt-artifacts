Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program iterates through each test case, calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations required, and then prints the result.

The program's logic is correct. It first calculates the maximum sum by iterating through each row and column of the matrix, and then determines the number of operations required to achieve this sum. The number of operations is calculated as 'n + r', where 'n' is the size of the matrix and 'r' is the largest number such that n*(n+1)//2 > i*n.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The operations are printed in the format specified in the problem statement, with the first 'n' lines containing the numbers from 1 to 'n', and the remaining lines containing the numbers from 1 to 'n' in a cyclic manner.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
