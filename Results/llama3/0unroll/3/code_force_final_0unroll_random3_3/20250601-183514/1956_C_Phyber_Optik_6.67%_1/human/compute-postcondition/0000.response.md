Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

In the initial state, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 500).

When the code is executed, the first line of the input is read, and the integer value is assigned to `t`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, we can conclude that `t` is now an integer between 1 and 500.

The remaining test cases are still in the `stdin`, but the first line has been consumed. Therefore, the updated state of `stdin` is that it contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been read.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been read.**
