Output State: **The loop will have executed 't' number of times, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 500. For each execution, it will have printed the sum of the series and the value of 'n + r', where 'n' is the input number and 'r' is the largest number such that n*(n+1)//2 > i*n. It will also have printed 'n + r' lines, each containing 'n' numbers. The first 'n' lines will contain the numbers from 1 to 'n', and the remaining lines will contain the numbers from 1 to 'n' in a cyclic manner. The value of 't' will remain unchanged.**
