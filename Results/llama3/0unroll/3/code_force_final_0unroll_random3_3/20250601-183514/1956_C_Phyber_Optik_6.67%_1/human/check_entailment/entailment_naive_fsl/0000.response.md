Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations. The program assumes that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the numbers from 1 to n in a specific order, but this is not always the case.

For example, consider a 3x3 matrix. The program would calculate the maximum sum as 21 (3 * (3 + 1) // 2 + 3 * 2) and the number of operations as 5 (3 + 2). However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to fill the matrix with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in the first row, and then fill the remaining rows with the numbers 4, 5, and 6, and finally fill the last column with the numbers 7, 8, and 9. This would result in a maximum sum of 45, which is greater than the sum calculated by the program.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
