Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved and prints the sum along with the number of operations required. It then prints the operations in the required format.

The program's logic is based on the idea of maximizing the sum by filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers. It calculates the maximum sum by iterating over the range from 1 to n and checking if the current number can be used to fill the entire row or column. If it can, it adds the sum of the numbers from 1 to n to the total sum. Otherwise, it adds the product of the current number and n to the total sum.

The program then prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. It first prints the operations for filling the rows, and then prints the operations for filling the columns. The operations are printed in the required format, with the type of operation, the row or column number, and the permutation of numbers.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly reads the input, calculates the maximum sum, and prints the operations in the required format. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
