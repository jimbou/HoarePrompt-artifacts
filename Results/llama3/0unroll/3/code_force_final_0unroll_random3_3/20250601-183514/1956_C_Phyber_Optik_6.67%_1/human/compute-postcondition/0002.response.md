Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer 'n' representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates the sum of a series based on 'n' and prints the sum along with the value of 'n + r', where 'r' is the largest number such that n*(n+1)//2 > i*n. Additionally, it prints 'n + r' lines, each containing 'n' numbers, with the first 'n' lines containing numbers from 1 to 'n' and the remaining lines containing numbers from 1 to 'n' in a cyclic manner. The function repeats this process for 't' number of test cases, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 500 provided at the beginning of the input.**
