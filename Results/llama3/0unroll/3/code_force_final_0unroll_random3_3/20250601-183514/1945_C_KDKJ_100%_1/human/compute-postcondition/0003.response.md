Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, where each list contains two elements: the count of 0s and the count of 1s in the corresponding prefix of `a`, `ans` is -1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been initialized to -1. The values of the other variables, `n`, `a`, and `S`, remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin remains empty, as no input was read or modified.
