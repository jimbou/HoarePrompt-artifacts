This function reads an integer n and a string a of length n from standard input, where a consists only of 0s and 1s. It then calculates the count of 0s and 1s in all prefixes of a and stores them in a list S. The function then iterates over the list S to find the index i that minimizes the absolute difference between n/2 and i, subject to the conditions that the count of 0s in the prefix up to index i is at least half the length of the prefix, and the count of 1s in the suffix starting from index i+1 is at least half the length of the suffix. If such an index is found, the function prints it; otherwise, it prints -1.
