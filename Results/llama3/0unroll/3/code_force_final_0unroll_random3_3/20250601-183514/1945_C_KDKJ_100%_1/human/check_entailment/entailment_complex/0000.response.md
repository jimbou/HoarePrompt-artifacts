Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes the data, and outputs the result. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from standard input, calculates the count of 0s and 1s in all prefixes of `a`, and stores them in a list `S`. It then iterates over the list `S` to find the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i`, subject to the conditions that the count of 0s in the prefix up to index `i` is at least half the length of the prefix, and the count of 1s in the suffix starting from index `i+1` is at least half the length of the suffix. If such an index is found, the function prints it; otherwise, it prints -1.

`func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of 0s and 1s of the same length, and processes each test case using the `func_1` function.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles multiple test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
