Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the prefix sums of 0s and 1s in the input string `a` and then iterates over the possible positions `i` to find the one that minimizes the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i`, subject to the conditions that the count of 0s in the prefix up to index `i` is at least half the length of the prefix, and the count of 1s in the suffix starting from index `i+1` is at least half the length of the suffix. The `func_2` function simply reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each test case using the `func_1` function.

Correctness: **True**
