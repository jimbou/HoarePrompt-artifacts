Output: **`ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i`, subject to the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`, where `left` is the count of 0s in the prefix of `a` up to index `i`, `lsum` is the length of the prefix up to index `i`, `right` is the count of 1s in the suffix of `a` starting from index `i+1`, and `rsum` is the length of the suffix starting from index `i+1`, and the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `n/2` and `i` is printed**
