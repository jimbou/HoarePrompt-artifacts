This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the number of lines to print for that test case. The function then prints 2t lines to standard output, with each pair of lines containing the numbers 1 and 1, followed by 1 and 2, and the remaining lines containing the numbers from 3 to n paired with themselves.
