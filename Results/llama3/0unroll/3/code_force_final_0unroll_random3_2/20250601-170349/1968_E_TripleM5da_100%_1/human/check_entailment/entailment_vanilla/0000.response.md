Reasoning:

The problem asks to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

However, the program has a logical error. It prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) for every test case, regardless of the value of n. This is incorrect because these points do not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of n.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the optimal arrangement for n = 3 is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), as shown in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
