Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints out n points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, upon analyzing the program, it becomes apparent that the program does not correctly solve the problem. The program prints out the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and then the points (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n. This does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints out the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the optimal arrangement for n = 3 is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which gives a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the given Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
