Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This is because the program is not correctly maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. The program is simply printing the coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i, i) for i from 3 to n, which does not guarantee the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should use a different approach, such as the one described in the problem statement, which involves choosing cells in a way that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
