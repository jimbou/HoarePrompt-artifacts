Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The program always prints the first two points as (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints the remaining points as (i, i) for i from 3 to n. However, this does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the optimal arrangement for n = 3 is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which gives a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
