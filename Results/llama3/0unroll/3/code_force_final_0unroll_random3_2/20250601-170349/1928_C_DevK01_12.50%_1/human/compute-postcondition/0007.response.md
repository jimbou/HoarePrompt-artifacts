Functionality: **This function takes two integers, q and x, as input, where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, and returns a list M containing all the divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1. The function identifies divisors by checking all numbers from 1 to the square root of q, and includes both the divisor and its corresponding quotient if they meet the condition. The function returns an empty list if no such divisors are found.**
