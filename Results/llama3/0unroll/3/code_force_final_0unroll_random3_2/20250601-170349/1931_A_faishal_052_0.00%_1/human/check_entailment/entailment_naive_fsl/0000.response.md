Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 6, the program outputs "aab", but the correct output should be "baa". The program does not correctly handle cases where the encoded word has a sum that is less than 26.

The issue lies in the way the program constructs the array `arr`. It first checks if the sum is less than or equal to 26, and if so, it appends 1 to the array and subtracts 1 from the sum. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will be in lexicographically smallest order.

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible combinations of three letters that sum up to the encoded word, and then return the lexicographically smallest one.
