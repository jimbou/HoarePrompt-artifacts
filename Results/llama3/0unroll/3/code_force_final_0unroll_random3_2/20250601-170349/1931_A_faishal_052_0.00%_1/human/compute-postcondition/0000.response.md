The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases), then a series of integers (the encoded words), each on a new line. The number of test cases is between 1 and 100, and each encoded word is between 3 and 78. After accepting the first integer, the stdin now contains a series of integers (the encoded words), each on a new line.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains a series of integers (the encoded words), each on a new line.**
