Functionality: **This function reads a series of encoded words from standard input, decodes each word into three lowercase letters using a specific algorithm, sorts the letters in ascending order, and prints them to the console. The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case corresponds to a single encoded word. The output is a series of strings, each consisting of three lowercase letters, with the number of strings equal to the number of test cases.**
