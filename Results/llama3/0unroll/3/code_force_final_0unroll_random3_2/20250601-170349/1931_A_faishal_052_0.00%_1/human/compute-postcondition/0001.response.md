Output State: **The output state will be a series of strings, each consisting of three lowercase letters, printed to the console. The letters are determined by the encoded words in the input, which are decoded using a specific algorithm. The decoded letters are then sorted in ascending order and printed to the console. The number of strings printed is equal to the value of the `cases` variable.**
