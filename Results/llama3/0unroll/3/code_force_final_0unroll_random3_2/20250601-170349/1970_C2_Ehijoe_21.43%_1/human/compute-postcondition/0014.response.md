Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on the moves made in a tree. It takes as input a tree represented as a dictionary of nodes and their neighboring nodes, and a start node. It identifies the leaf nodes in the tree and then calls another function, func_1, to determine the moves made from the start node. If any of the moves are odd, it prints 'Ron' as the winner; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione' as the winner. The function does not modify the input tree or any other variables, and its sole purpose is to determine and print the winner based on the moves made.**
