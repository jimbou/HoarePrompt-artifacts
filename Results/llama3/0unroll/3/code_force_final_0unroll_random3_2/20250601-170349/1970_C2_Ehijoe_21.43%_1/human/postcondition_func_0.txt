This function calculates the distances from a specified start node to all other nodes in a tree, excluding the parent node of the start node. It returns a list of these distances, where each distance is 1 plus the distance from the start node to the node's parent. If the start node has only one child and that child is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single element, which is the integer 0.
