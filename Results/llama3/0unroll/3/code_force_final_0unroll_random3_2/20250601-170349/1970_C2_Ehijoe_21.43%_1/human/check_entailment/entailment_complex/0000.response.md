Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem requires determining the winner of a game played on a tree, where the game consists of moving a stone from a start node to an inactive neighbor node until no valid move is available. The program correctly implements this by first constructing the tree from the input edges, identifying the leaf nodes, and then calculating the distances from the start node to all other nodes in the tree using the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function correctly calculates these distances by recursively traversing the tree and excluding the parent node of the start node. The main function, `func_2`, then uses these distances to determine the winner of the game by checking if any of the moves are odd. If any move is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins. The program correctly prints the winner based on this logic.

Correctness: **True**
