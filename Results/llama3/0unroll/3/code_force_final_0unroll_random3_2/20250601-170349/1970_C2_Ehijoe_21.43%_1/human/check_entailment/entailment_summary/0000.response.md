Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's why:

1. The problem description states that the game is played on a tree of n nodes, and the goal is to determine the winner of each round based on the moves made from a given start node.

2. Function `func_1` calculates the distances from a specified start node to all other nodes in the tree, excluding the parent node of the start node. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that a move consists of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there.

3. Function `func_2` determines the winner of the game based on the moves made from the start node. It identifies the leaf nodes in the tree, calls `func_1` to determine the moves made from the start node, and then checks if any of the moves are odd. If any move is odd, it prints 'Ron' as the winner; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione' as the winner. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the player who cannot make a move loses the round.

4. The program takes the correct input, which includes the number of nodes in the tree, the number of rounds, the edges of the tree, and the start node for each round.

5. The program does not modify the input tree or any other variables, and its sole purpose is to determine and print the winner based on the moves made.

Overall, the program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the moves made from the start node. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
