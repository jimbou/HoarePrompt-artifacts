    if (len(nodes[start]) == 1 and nodes[start][0] == parent) :

    #The program returns a list of integers representing the distances from the start node to all other nodes in the tree that are not the parent node of the start node, where each distance is 1 plus the distance from the start node to the node's parent.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the distances from a specified start node to all other nodes in a tree, excluding the parent node of the start node. It returns a list of these distances, where each distance is 1 plus the distance from the start node to the node's parent. If the start node has only one child and that child is the parent node, the function returns a list containing a single element, which is the integer 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, start is a node in the tree.

        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: The leaves deque contains all the leaf nodes in the tree rooted at the start node, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of start is an integer equal to the input value, and the value of moves is the output of func_1(nodes, start). If moves contains at least one odd number, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in moves are even, and 'Hermione' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the moves made in a tree. It takes as input a tree represented as a dictionary of nodes and their neighboring nodes, and a start node. It identifies the leaf nodes in the tree and then calls another function, func_1, to determine the moves made from the start node. If any of the moves are odd, it prints 'Ron' as the winner; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione' as the winner. The function does not modify the input tree or any other variables, and its sole purpose is to determine and print the winner based on the moves made.
