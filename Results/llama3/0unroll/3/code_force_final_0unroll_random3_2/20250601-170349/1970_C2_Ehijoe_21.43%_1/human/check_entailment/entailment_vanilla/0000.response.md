Reasoning:

The problem is asking to determine the winner of a game played on a tree of n nodes. The game starts with a stone on a node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor. The player who cannot make a move loses. The problem states that all rounds are played with the same tree, and after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive again.

The given program is attempting to solve this problem by first constructing the tree from the input edges. It then identifies the leaves of the tree (nodes with only one neighbor) and uses a recursive function `func_1` to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.

The key insight in the program is that if there is a node with an odd distance from the starting node, then Ron can win the game by moving the stone to that node. This is because Ron can always move the stone to a node with an odd distance, forcing Hermione to move the stone to a node with an even distance, and so on. Eventually, Ron will be able to move the stone to a leaf node, winning the game.

The program checks if there is a node with an odd distance from the starting node by using the `any` function with a generator expression. If any of the distances are odd, the program prints "Ron". Otherwise, it prints "Hermione".

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the winner of the game based on the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. The use of recursion in `func_1` is also correct, as it allows the program to efficiently calculate the distances to all nodes in the tree.

Correctness: **True**
