Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with n-1 edges, start is a node in the tree, n and t are integers, edges is an empty list, empty is True, leaves is an empty deque**

The code creates an empty deque called `leaves`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain the same. The `leaves` deque is initially empty, waiting for elements to be added to it.
