Output: **wins is the number of elements in the list a that are less than or equal to the element at index k-1, and i is equal to the index of the first element in a that is greater than the element at index k-1, or n if no such element exists. The current value of wins is greater than or equal to k., and this is printed: wins - 1 (where wins - 1 is the value of wins minus 1)**
