This function determines the maximum number of wins that can be achieved in a game where a player can win by having a score less than or equal to the score of the k-th player. The function takes as input a list of scores and an integer k, and prints the maximum number of wins that can be achieved either by the player's current score or by swapping the player's score with the score of the k-th player. If the player's current score is already less than or equal to the score of the k-th player, the function prints the number of wins minus one. Otherwise, it prints the maximum number of wins that can be achieved by swapping the scores.
