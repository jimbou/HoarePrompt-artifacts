Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, followed by t lines, each containing two integers x and n. It then calculates and prints the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to n for each pair of x and n. The function iterates through all possible divisors of x, updating the maximum divisor if it finds a larger one that is less than or equal to n. The function's output is the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to n for each input pair.**
