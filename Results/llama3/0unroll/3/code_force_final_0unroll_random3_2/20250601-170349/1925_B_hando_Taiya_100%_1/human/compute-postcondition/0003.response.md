The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor of the integer `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Since `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, the value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that does not exceed `n`.

For example, if `x` is 12 and `n` is 6, the divisors of `x` are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The maximum divisor that is less than or equal to `n` (6) is 6. Therefore, `ans` would be 6.

However, without knowing the exact values of `x` and `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. Nevertheless, we can describe the output as the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to n**
