You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). The array a is beautiful, i.e., it can be made all its elements the same by using the given operation an arbitrary number of times.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        aa = set(a)
        
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each execution, it will read two lines from stdin. The first line will contain a single integer n, and the second line will contain n integers. The loop will then process these integers and print the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the array. The value of t will be decremented by 1 after each execution, and the loop will terminate when t becomes 0. The final state will have the same value of t (which will be 0), and the stdin will be empty. The output will contain t lines, each containing the minimum count of consecutive equal elements for the corresponding test case.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
