Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each execution, it will read two lines from stdin. The first line will contain a single integer n, and the second line will contain n integers. The loop will then process these integers and print the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the array. The value of t will be decremented by 1 after each execution, and the loop will terminate when t becomes 0. The final state will have the same value of t (which will be 0), and the stdin will be empty. The output will contain t lines, each containing the minimum count of consecutive equal elements for the corresponding test case.**
