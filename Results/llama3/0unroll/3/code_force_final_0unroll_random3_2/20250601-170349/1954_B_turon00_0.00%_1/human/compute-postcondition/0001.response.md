Output State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, it has read two lines from the standard input. The first line contains a single integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The loop has calculated the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in the array `a` and printed this value. The variables `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans` have been updated accordingly for each iteration. The standard input has been consumed by `2*t` lines.
