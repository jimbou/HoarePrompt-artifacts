This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers. It then processes these integers to find the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the array and prints this count for each test case. If the array already contains all equal elements, it prints -1. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read and processed, at which point the standard input is empty and the output contains the minimum count of consecutive equal elements for each test case.
