Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are the same.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements. It checks if all elements in the array are the same, and if so, it prints -1 as it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

If the array contains different elements, it iterates through the array to find the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. This is done by maintaining a count of consecutive equal elements and updating the minimum count whenever a different element is encountered.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles the edge case where the array already contains all equal elements.

Correctness: **True**
