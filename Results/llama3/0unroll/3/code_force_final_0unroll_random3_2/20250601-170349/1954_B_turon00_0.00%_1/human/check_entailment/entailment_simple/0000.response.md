Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

2. If not all elements are the same, it initializes a variable `cnt` to 0 and `ans` to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array. `cnt` is used to count the number of consecutive equal elements, and `ans` is used to store the minimum count.

3. It then iterates over the array. If the current element is equal to the first element of the array (`tmp`), it increments `cnt`. If the current element is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. After the loop, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` one more time, because the last sequence of equal elements is not handled in the loop.

5. Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when all elements are the same, or when the array has only one element. It also correctly handles the case when the array has multiple sequences of equal elements.

Correctness: **True**
