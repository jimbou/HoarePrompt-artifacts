Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.

The program then checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

If the array contains different elements, the program iterates through the array and keeps track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element. Whenever it encounters a different element, it updates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.

Finally, the program prints the minimum count of consecutive occurrences, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks for consecutive occurrences of the first element, but it does not consider the case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements from the middle. For example, in the array [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], removing the middle element 2 would make the array non-beautiful, but the program would not detect this.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
