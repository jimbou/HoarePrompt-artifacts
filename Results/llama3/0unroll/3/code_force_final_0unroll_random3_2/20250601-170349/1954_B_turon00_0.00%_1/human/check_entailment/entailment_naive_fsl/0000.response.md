Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only two distinct elements, and the first and last elements are the same. In this case, the program will output the count of the first element, which is not the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful.

For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the program will output 2, which is the count of the first element 1. However, the correct output should be 1, because removing one of the middle elements (either 2) will make the array not beautiful.

The program's logic is incorrect because it only checks for the count of the first element and does not consider the case when the first and last elements are the same. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check for the minimum count of elements that need to be removed to make the array not beautiful, considering all possible cases.
