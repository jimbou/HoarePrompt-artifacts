Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by using a specific operation an arbitrary number of times.

The program works by first reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself. It then checks if all elements in the array are the same, in which case it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful.

If the array contains different elements, the program iterates through the array, counting the consecutive occurrences of the first element. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found so far. Finally, it prints this minimum count, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases, including arrays with all equal elements and arrays with different elements. The use of a set to check if all elements are the same is efficient, and the iteration through the array to find the minimum count of consecutive equal elements is also efficient.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
