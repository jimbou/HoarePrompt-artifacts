Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n). The array a is beautiful, i.e., it can be made all its elements the same by using the given operation an arbitrary number of times.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases minus one. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the number of test cases has been reduced by one. Each test case still contains two lines, with the first line containing a single integer n and the second line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The array a is still beautiful, meaning it can be made all its elements the same by using the given operation an arbitrary number of times.
