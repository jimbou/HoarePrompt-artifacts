Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. It then determines the indices of the maximum and minimum elements in each permutation and prints them to standard output, one pair per line. The function iteratively queries the input to compare elements and find the maximum and minimum indices, and it handles multiple test cases.**
