Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of each permutation.
2. It uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum element in the permutation, which is the first element that will be used to maximize the XOR operation. This is done by comparing each element with the current maximum element and updating the maximum element if necessary.
3. Once the maximum element is found, the program uses another binary search-like approach to find the minimum element that will maximize the XOR operation with the maximum element. This is done by comparing each element with the maximum element and updating the minimum element if necessary.
4. The program correctly prints the indices of the maximum and minimum elements that maximize the XOR operation.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted and the program handles the input and output correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
