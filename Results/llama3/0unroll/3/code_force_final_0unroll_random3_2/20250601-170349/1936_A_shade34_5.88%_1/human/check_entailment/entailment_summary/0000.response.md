Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The program iteratively queries the input to compare elements and find the maximum and minimum indices, and it handles multiple test cases.

The program first finds the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum. It then finds the minimum element among the elements that have the same bitwise OR result as the maximum element. Finally, it prints the indices of the maximum and minimum elements.

The program uses at most 3n queries, as required by the problem statement. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, by outputting any one of them.

Correctness: **True**
