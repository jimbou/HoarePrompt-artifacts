Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n distinct integers p_i (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `n` has been assigned an integer value between 2 and 50 (inclusive) from the input, and the remaining input in stdin consists of t-1 test cases, where each test case still contains an integer n followed by n distinct integers p_i.
