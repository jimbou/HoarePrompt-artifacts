Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an integer p_i such that p_i is equal to the (p_i-1)th integer in the list. If such an integer is found, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function repeats this process for all test cases and outputs the results, one per line, without modifying the input data.**
