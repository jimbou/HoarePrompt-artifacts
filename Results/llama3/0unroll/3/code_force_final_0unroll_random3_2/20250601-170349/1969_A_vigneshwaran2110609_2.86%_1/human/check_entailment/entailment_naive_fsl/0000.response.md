Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 3. However, if the input is:

3
6
2 3 4 5 6 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4. The program does not correctly handle cases where there are more than two pairs of friends that can attend the party.

The program only checks if there is a pair of friends that can attend the party, and if so, it prints 2. If not, it prints 3. However, this is not sufficient to solve the problem. The program needs to find the minimum number of invitations that need to be sent to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.

A correct solution would involve finding all pairs of friends that can attend the party, and then finding the minimum number of invitations that need to be sent to ensure that at least two friends attend the party.
