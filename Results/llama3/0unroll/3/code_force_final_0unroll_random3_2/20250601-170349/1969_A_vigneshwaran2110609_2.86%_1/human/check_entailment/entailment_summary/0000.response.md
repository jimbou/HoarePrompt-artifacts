Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., p_i is equal to the (p_i-1)th integer in the list). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to have at least two friends come to the party.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the edge cases. For example, in the third test case, where n=2 and p=[2, 1], the program correctly prints 2, as Monocarp only needs to send invitations to both friends to have both of them come to the party.

Correctness: **True**
