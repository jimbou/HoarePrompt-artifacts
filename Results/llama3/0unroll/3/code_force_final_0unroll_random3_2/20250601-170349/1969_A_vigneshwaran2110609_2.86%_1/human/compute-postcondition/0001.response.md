Output State: **The output state will be a series of numbers, either 2 or 3, each on a new line, equal to the number of test cases (t-1). For each test case, if there exists an integer p_i such that p_i is equal to the (p_i-1)th integer in the list, the output will be 2. Otherwise, the output will be 3.**
