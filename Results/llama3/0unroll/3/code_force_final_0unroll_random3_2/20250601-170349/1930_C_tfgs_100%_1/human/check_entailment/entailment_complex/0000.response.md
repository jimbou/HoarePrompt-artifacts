Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a` by performing the specified operations.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input and modifies the array `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the element at index `i` is incremented by `i + 1`.

2. The program then removes duplicates from the array `a` by converting it to a set and back to a list. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the set `S` can only contain unique elements.

3. The program sorts the array `a` in descending order. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the array `b` is constructed by sorting the set `S` in decreasing order.

4. The program then fills in missing elements between each pair of adjacent elements in the array `a`. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the array `b` is constructed by filling in missing elements between each pair of adjacent elements in the set `S`.

5. Finally, the program appends additional elements to the end of the array `b`, each being one less than the last element. This is correct because the problem statement specifies that the array `b` is constructed by appending additional elements to the end of the array, each being one less than the last element.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a` by performing the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
