Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a` by performing the specified operations.

The program first increments each element in `a` by its 1-based index and counts the occurrences of each element using a `Counter`. It then creates a sorted list of unique elements in descending order. The program then iterates over the sorted list, and for each element, it calculates the maximum number of additional elements that can be inserted before it without violating the lexicographical order. These additional elements are inserted into the result list `ans`. Finally, the program appends the remaining elements from the sorted list to `ans` and prints the result.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the edge cases where the input array `a` contains duplicate elements or elements with large values. The use of a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element ensures that the program correctly handles cases where an element is inserted multiple times into the set `S`.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
