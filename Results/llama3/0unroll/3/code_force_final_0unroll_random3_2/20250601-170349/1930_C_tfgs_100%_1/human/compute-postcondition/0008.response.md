The code prints all elements from the original list 'a' in descending order, with each element repeated the same number of times as it appeared in the original list, and the missing elements in between each pair of adjacent elements in 'a' are filled in descending order, and 'cnt' number of elements are appended to 'ans' with each element being one less than the last element in 'ans'.
Output: **all elements from the original list 'a' in descending order, with each element repeated the same number of times as it appeared in the original list, and the missing elements in between each pair of adjacent elements in 'a' are filled in descending order, and 'cnt' number of elements are appended to 'ans' with each element being one less than the last element in 'ans'**
