This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the result. It accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. The function modifies the list by incrementing each element by its index plus one, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and fills in missing elements between each pair of adjacent elements. It then appends additional elements to the end of the list, each being one less than the last element. The function prints the resulting list.
