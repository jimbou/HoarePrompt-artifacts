Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The program uses two functions: `func_1` to calculate the GCD of two numbers, and `func_2` to calculate the number of valid pairs.

The `func_2` function iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m`, and for each `i`, it calculates the number of valid pairs. The calculation is based on the fact that `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`, which is equivalent to `a+b` being a multiple of `i*i`. The program correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for each `i` and sums them up to get the total count.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` or `m` is 1. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

After analyzing the program and trying to find potential cases where it may not work as expected, I couldn't find any such cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
