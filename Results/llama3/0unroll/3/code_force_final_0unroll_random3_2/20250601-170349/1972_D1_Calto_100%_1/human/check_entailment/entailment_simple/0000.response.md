Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description. The program uses two functions: `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and `func_2` to calculate the number of valid pairs.

In `func_2`, the program iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m`. For each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Then, it updates the count of valid pairs by adding the number of multiples of `y` that are less than or equal to `x`, plus 1 if `x` is a multiple of `y`. This is done using the `math.ceil` function to round up the division result and checking if `x` is a multiple of `y` using the modulo operator.

The program returns the total count of valid pairs, which is at least `-1 + m`.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of valid pairs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
