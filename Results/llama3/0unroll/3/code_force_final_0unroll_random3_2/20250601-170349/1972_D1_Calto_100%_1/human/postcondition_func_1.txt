This function calculates and returns a count value based on the input positive integers `n` and `m`. The count is calculated by iterating over a range from 1 to `m` (inclusive), performing arithmetic operations involving `n` and the current iteration number `i`, and incrementing the count based on the results of these operations. The function does not modify the input values `n` and `m`. The returned count is at least `-1 + m`.
