Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

`func_2` calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. It iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m` and calculates the number of valid pairs for each `i`. The calculation involves finding the maximum value of `x` such that `x / y` is an integer, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. The `math.ceil` function is used to round up the result to the nearest integer.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1.  The `func_1` function is not used anywhere in the program. It seems to be a leftover from a previous version of the code.
2.  The `func_2` function does not take into account the gcd of `a` and `b` when calculating the number of valid pairs. This is a crucial part of the problem statement.
3.  The program does not handle the case where `n` or `m` is 1 correctly. In this case, the number of valid pairs is simply `n * m`.

Due to these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
