Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

    1
    4
    1 1 1 1

The program outputs 0, but the correct output should be 1, because we can form a square with side length 1 using all 4 sticks.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for sticks that can form triangles (i.e., sticks with length that appears at least 3 times), but it does not consider other types of polygons, such as squares, pentagons, etc. The program should be modified to check for all possible polygon types, not just triangles.
