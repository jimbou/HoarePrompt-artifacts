Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then calculates and prints the total number of shapes that can be formed from each test case, where a shape is defined as a set of three identical integers. The function does not modify the input data and does not have any side effects beyond printing the results.**
