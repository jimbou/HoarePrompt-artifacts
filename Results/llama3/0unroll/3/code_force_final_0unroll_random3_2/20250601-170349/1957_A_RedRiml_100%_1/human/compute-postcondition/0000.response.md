Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the variable `w` is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The remaining input in stdin consists of t-1 test cases, each containing an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
