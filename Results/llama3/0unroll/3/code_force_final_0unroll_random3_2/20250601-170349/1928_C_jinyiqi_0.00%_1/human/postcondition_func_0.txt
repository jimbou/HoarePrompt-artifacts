This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a list of integers that includes all divisors of the input integers, including the integers themselves, in a specific order. The returned list contains the divisors of the larger integer in ascending order, followed by the divisors of the smaller integer in descending order.
