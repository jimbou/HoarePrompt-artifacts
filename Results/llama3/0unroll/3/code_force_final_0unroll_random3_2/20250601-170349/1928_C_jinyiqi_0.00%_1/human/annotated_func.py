#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1.
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: Output State: x is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, output1 is a list of integers, output2 is a list of integers.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list of integers that is a combination of `output2` and the reversed list `output1`. The reversed list `output1` contains two integers that are in reverse order of the original list `x`, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of two integers as input, where the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1. It returns a list of integers that includes all divisors of the input integers, including the integers themselves, in a specific order. The returned list contains the divisors of the larger integer in ascending order, followed by the divisors of the smaller integer in descending order.
