Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is (10, 2), the program outputs 4, which is correct. However, when the input is (10, 1), the program outputs 1, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, the settling does not exist for k = 1, so the output should be 0.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when x = 1. In this case, the program should return 0, but instead, it returns 1. This is because the program does not check if x = 1 before calculating the output.

To fix this issue, the program should add a condition to check if x = 1 and return 0 in this case. Here is the corrected code:

```
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        output = []
        if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
            sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
            for s in sep:
                if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                    output.append((s + 2) / 2)
        if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
            sep = func_1(n - x)
            for s in sep:
                if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                    output.append((s + 2) / 2)
        output = list(set(output))
        print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
