Output State: **`x` is a list of two integers, the first integer is greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer is greater than 1, `output1` is a reversed list of integers, `output2` is a list of integers.**

In this output state, the list `output1` has been reversed, meaning its elements are now in the opposite order. The other variables, `x` and `output2`, remain unchanged. The relationship between the integers in `x` is still valid, with the first integer being greater than or equal to the second integer, and the second integer being greater than 1.
