Functionality: **This function reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It takes no arguments and returns no values. The function iterates over a specified number of test cases, where each case involves reading a list of positive integers and a list of query values. For each query value, the function applies another function (`func_1`) to the query value and the list of positive integers, and appends the result to a list of results. The function then prints the list of results. The function does not modify the input values, but it does update the list of positive integers for each test case.**
