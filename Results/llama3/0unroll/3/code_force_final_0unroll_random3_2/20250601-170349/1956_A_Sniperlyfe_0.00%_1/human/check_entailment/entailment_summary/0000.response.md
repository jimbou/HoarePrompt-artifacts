Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the number of players declared as winners in a game based on a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k and the number of players n_i in each test case. The game involves kicking out players at positions specified by the sequence a, and the game ends when no players are kicked out in a round.

Function func_1 takes two arguments, n and p, where n is the number of players and p is the sequence of integers. It repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in p that are less than or equal to n from n until n is less than the minimum value in p. This process simulates the game, where players are kicked out at positions specified by p, and the function returns the final value of n, which represents the number of players declared as winners.

Function func_2 reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the results. It iterates over a specified number of test cases, where each case involves reading a list of positive integers p and a list of query values qs. For each query value n in qs, func_2 applies func_1 to n and p, and appends the result to a list of results. The function then prints the list of results.

Based on the execution summaries, func_1 correctly simulates the game and returns the number of players declared as winners, and func_2 correctly reads input, applies func_1 to each query value, and prints the results. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
