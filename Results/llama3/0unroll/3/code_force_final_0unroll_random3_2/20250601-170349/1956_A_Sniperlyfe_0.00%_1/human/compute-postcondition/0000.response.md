Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of positive integers such that for all `i`, `j` in `p`, `i` < `j` and 1 <= `i` <= 100, `t` is an integer**.

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `p` also remains unchanged, with all its elements being positive integers in ascending order, ranging from 1 to 100. The new variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer from the input.
