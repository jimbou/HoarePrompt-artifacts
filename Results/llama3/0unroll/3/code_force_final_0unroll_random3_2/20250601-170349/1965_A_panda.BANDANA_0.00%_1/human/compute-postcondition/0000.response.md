Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer. The list of integers contains positive integers.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer from the stdin, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, since one test case has been read. Each remaining test case still contains two inputs: an integer and a list of integers, where the integer is positive and the list contains positive integers.
