Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer and a list of positive integers. It then checks if the number 1 is present in each list and prints 'Bob' if it is, or 'Alice' if it's not. The function repeats this process for the number of test cases specified by the initial input, resulting in a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' outputs printed to the console.**
