Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed to the console, depending on whether 1 is present in each list of integers. The number of outputs is equal to the initial value of `t`. The value of `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration, and the input buffer is empty after all iterations. The values of `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` are updated in each iteration but do not persist after the loop finishes.**
