Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can remove the smallest number of stones from each nonempty pile, but the program only checks if 1 is in the list of pile sizes. This is not sufficient to determine the winner.

For example, consider the case where the list of pile sizes is [2, 2, 2]. In this case, the program will print "Alice", but the correct winner is actually "Bob". This is because Alice can only remove 1 stone from each pile on her first turn, leaving Bob with the opportunity to remove the remaining stones on his turn.

A correct solution would need to consider the smallest number of stones that can be removed from each nonempty pile, not just whether 1 is in the list of pile sizes.
