Reasoning:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the size of the smallest nonempty pile. The program, however, simply checks if the number 1 is present in the list of pile sizes and prints 'Bob' if it is, or 'Alice' if it's not. This is not a correct solution to the problem.

The correct solution would involve finding the smallest nonempty pile and determining the winner based on its size. If the size of the smallest nonempty pile is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

Correctness: **False**
