Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, sort each pair in ascending order, and print the sorted pairs. The program first reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, then iterates `t` times to read pairs of integers `x` and `y`. Inside the loop, it checks if `x` is less than `y` and prints the pair in ascending order accordingly.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly reads the input, sorts each pair of integers, and prints the sorted pairs. The use of the `map` function to convert the input strings to integers is also correct. The conditional statement to determine the order of printing `x` and `y` is straightforward and accurate.

Correctness: **True**
