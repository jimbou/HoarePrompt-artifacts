Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the number of test cases as input, then for each test case, it takes two integers x and y as input and prints the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y.

The program uses a simple if-else statement to determine which number is smaller and which is larger, and prints them in the correct order. This approach works for all possible inputs, including when x and y are equal.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
