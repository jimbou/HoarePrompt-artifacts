Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains x lines, each containing two space-separated integers.**

In this output state, the value of `x` is assigned the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains x lines, each containing two space-separated integers, as the first input (the integer t) has been consumed by the `input()` function.
