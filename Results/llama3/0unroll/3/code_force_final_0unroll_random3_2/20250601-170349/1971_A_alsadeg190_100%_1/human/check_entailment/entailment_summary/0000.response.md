Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, sort each pair in ascending order, and print the sorted pairs. The program correctly implements this functionality by comparing each pair of integers and printing the smaller value first, followed by the larger value.

The program's logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases for the input pairs, including when the two numbers are equal. The use of the `map` function to convert the input strings to integers is also correct.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example input and output provided in the problem description match the program's expected behavior.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, execution summary, and example input and output, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
