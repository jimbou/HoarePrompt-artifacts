Reasoning:

The problem requires the program to take two integers x and y as input and output the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y.

The given program defines a function func() that takes an integer x as input, representing the number of test cases. It then iterates over a range of x, taking two space-separated integers x and y as input in each iteration.

Inside the loop, the program checks if x is less than y. If true, it prints x and y. If false, it prints y and x. This logic ensures that the program always prints the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y.

The program correctly handles the input format, as specified in the problem description, and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
