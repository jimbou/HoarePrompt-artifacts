Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm described in the problem. The issue lies in the way the mapping between characters is created. The program iterates over the encoded string and for each character, it checks if it is already in the mapping. If not, it finds the first character in the alphabet that is not in the mapping values and assigns it to the current character. This approach does not guarantee that the correct symmetric character from the string r is assigned to each character in the encoded string.

A counterexample is the input "ttf". The correct decoding should be "fft", but the program outputs "ttf". This is because the program assigns 't' to 't' in the mapping, instead of assigning 't' to 'f' which is the correct symmetric character.

To correctly implement the decoding algorithm, the program should first create the string r by finding all distinct characters in the encoded string and sorting them in alphabetical order. Then, it should iterate over the encoded string and for each character, find its symmetric character in the string r and assign it to the decoded string.
