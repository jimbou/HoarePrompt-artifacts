Decodes a string of lowercase Latin letters by creating a mapping of encoded characters to decoded characters and returns the decoded string. The function accepts a string of encoded characters as input and returns a string of decoded characters, where each decoded character is a unique lowercase Latin letter. The function ensures that each encoded character is mapped to a unique decoded character, and the mapping is created on the fly as the function processes the input string.
