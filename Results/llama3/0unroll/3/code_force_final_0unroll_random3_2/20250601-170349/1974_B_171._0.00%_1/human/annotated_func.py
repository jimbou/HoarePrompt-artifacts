#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char
                    break
            decoded.append(chr(c))
        
    #State: Output State: The decoded list contains the decoded characters, and the mapping dictionary contains the mapping of lowercase Latin letters to their corresponding decoded characters.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns a string that contains all the decoded characters from the decoded list, where each character is a decoded version of a lowercase Latin letter according to the mapping dictionary.

#Overall this is what the function does:Decodes a string of lowercase Latin letters by creating a mapping of encoded characters to decoded characters and returns the decoded string. The function accepts a string of encoded characters as input and returns a string of decoded characters, where each decoded character is a unique lowercase Latin letter. The function ensures that each encoded character is mapped to a unique decoded character, and the mapping is created on the fly as the function processes the input string.
