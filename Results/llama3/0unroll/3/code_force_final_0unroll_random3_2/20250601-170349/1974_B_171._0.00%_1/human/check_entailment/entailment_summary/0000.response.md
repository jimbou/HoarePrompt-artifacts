Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program attempts to decode a string by creating a mapping of encoded characters to decoded characters. However, the approach used is incorrect. The program tries to map each encoded character to a decoded character by iterating over all lowercase Latin letters and assigning the first available letter as the decoded character. This approach does not correctly reverse the encoding process described in the problem.

The correct approach would be to first find all distinct characters in the encoded string and sort them in alphabetical order. Then, for each character in the encoded string, find its symmetric character in the sorted distinct characters and use that as the decoded character.

Correctness: **False**
