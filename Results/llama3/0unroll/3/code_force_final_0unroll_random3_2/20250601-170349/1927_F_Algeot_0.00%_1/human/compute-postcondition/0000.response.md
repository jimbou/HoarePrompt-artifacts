The code `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to 10^6 (1,000,000). This means that the Python interpreter can now handle recursive calls up to a depth of 1,000,000.

Output State: **The maximum recursion limit is set to 1,000,000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers n and m, followed by m lines, each containing three integers u, v, and w.**
