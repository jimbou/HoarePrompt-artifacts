Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. One such case is when the input is:

```
1
4
>><<
>><<
```

In this case, the program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES'. The robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the arrows in the second row are pointing to the right, but it does not consider the arrows in the first row. In this case, the arrow in the first row at position 1 is pointing to the right, which allows the robot to move to the second row and then to the right.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
