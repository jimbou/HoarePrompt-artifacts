Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), the second line contains a string of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', and the third line contains a string of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>'. The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5.**
