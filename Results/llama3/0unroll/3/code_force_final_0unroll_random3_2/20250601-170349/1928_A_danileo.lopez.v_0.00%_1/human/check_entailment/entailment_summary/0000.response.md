Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if at least one dimension of the rectangle is even, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for Bob to be able to obtain another rectangle. If at least one dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then combine them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
