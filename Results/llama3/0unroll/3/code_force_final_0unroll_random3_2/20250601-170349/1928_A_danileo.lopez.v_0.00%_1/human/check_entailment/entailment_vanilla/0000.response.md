Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if either the width (a) or the height (b) of the rectangle is even. If either of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, this approach is not entirely correct. The program is missing a crucial condition. If both a and b are odd, but not equal, then another rectangle can still be formed. For example, a 3x5 rectangle can be cut into two 3x2 rectangles and then rearranged to form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x5 rectangle.

The program should also check if a and b are not equal, in addition to checking if they are even. If a and b are not equal, then another rectangle can be formed, regardless of whether they are even or odd.

Therefore, the correct program should be:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 or a != b:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

Correctness: **False**
