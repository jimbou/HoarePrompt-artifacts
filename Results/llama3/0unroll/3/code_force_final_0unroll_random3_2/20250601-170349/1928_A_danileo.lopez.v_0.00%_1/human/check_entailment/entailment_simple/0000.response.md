Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem requires determining if a rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The key insight is that if either the length or width of the original rectangle is even, it can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and these can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly implements this insight by checking if either `a` or `b` is even using the modulo operator (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`). If either condition is true, it prints "Yes", indicating that a different rectangle can be formed. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "No", indicating that no different rectangle can be formed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `a` and `b` are both 1 (in which case no different rectangle can be formed).

Correctness: **True**
