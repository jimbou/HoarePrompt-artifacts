Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads the first line from stdin, which contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4).
	* `int()` converts this input to an integer.
	* The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Since `t` is now assigned a value, the output state will include this new information.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input, with the first line already read.**

In natural language, this means that the variable `t` now holds a value between 1 and 10^4, and the stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has already been read and processed.
