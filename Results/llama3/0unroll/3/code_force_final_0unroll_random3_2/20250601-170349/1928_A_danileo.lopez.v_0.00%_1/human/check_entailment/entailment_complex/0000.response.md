Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem statement asks to determine if it's possible to cut a rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then reassemble them into a different rectangle. The key insight here is that if either of the original rectangle's dimensions is even, it's always possible to cut it into two smaller rectangles and reassemble them into a different rectangle.

The program correctly implements this insight by checking if either `a` or `b` is even using the modulo operator (`a % 2 == 0` or `b % 2 == 0`). If either condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to form a different rectangle. If both conditions are false (i.e., both `a` and `b` are odd), it prints 'No', indicating that it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
