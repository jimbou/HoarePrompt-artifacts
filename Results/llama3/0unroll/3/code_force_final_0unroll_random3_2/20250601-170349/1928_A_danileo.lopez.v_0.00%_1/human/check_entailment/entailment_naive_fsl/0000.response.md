Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 2 2, the program outputs 'Yes', but according to the problem description, the 2 x 2 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if either a or b is even, but it does not consider the case where both a and b are even, which is not allowed according to the problem description. 

A correct solution would need to check if both a and b are even, and if so, output 'No'. Otherwise, it should output 'Yes'. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('No')
        elif a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```
