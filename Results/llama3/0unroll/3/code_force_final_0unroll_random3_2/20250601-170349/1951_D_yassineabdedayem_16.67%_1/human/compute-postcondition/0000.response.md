The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the first line of the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) â€” the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line is empty, and the following lines contain two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) â€” the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.**
