Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers, n and k. For each test case, it attempts to find a sequence of jewel purchases that Alice can make to end up with k jewels, given that she starts with n coins. If a valid sequence is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. If no valid sequence is found, it prints 'NO'. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.**
