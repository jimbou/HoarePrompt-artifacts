Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes the number of coins Alice has (n) and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (k) as input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k.
3. It initializes variables rep (to keep track of the number of stalls), number (to store the price per jewel for each stall), and tab (a list to store the prices for each stall).
4. The program enters a while loop that continues until one of the following conditions is met:
   - n becomes 0 (Alice has no more coins).
   - k becomes 0 (Alice has bought the desired number of jewels).
   - The number of stalls (rep) reaches 60.
   - The remaining amount of money (n) is less than the number of jewels (k) Alice still needs to buy.
5. Inside the loop, the program calculates the minimum and maximum possible prices per jewel for the current stall. The minimum price is the minimum of n divided by k and k, while the maximum price is the maximum of the integer division of n by k and k.
6. If the maximum price is equal to k and the product of n and the minimum price is less than or equal to k, the program sets the price per jewel to the minimum price and subtracts the maximum price from k. Otherwise, it sets the price per jewel to the maximum price and subtracts the minimum price from k.
7. The program appends the calculated price per jewel to the tab list, subtracts the product of the minimum price and the maximum price from n, and increments the rep counter.
8. After the loop, if k is 0, the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (len(tab)) and the prices for each stall (tab). If k is not 0, it prints "NO".

Correctness: **True**
