Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n is less than k. In this case, the program will print "NO" even if it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

For example, if n = 5 and k = 6, the program will print "NO" because n is less than k. However, it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly 6 jewels. One possible solution is to set up 6 stalls with prices 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1. Alice will buy 1 jewel from each stall, and she will have 0 coins left.

The program does not handle this case correctly because it checks if n is greater than or equal to k before setting up the stalls. If n is less than k, the program immediately prints "NO" without checking if it is possible to set up the stalls to achieve the desired outcome.

To fix this issue, the program should check if n is less than k and handle this case separately. If n is less than k, the program should check if it is possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. If it is possible, the program should print "YES" and the prices of the stalls. If it is not possible, the program should print "NO".
