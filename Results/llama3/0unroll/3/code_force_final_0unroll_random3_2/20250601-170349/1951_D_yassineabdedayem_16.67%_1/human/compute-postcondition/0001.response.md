Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' statements, each followed by either a sequence of numbers or nothing, depending on whether the loop was able to find a valid sequence of jewel purchases for Alice. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' statements is equal to the initial value of `t`. The stdin is empty, having been fully read by the loop. The value of `t` is unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.**
