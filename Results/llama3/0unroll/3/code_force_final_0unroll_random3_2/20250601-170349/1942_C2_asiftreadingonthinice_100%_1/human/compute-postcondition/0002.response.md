Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers, where each integer represents the minimum number of operations required to make the array a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, for each test case. The list has a length of t-1, where t is the initial value of tt. The output state is in the same format as the initial execution state, with the same variable names and data types. The values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated after the loop executes all the iterations.
