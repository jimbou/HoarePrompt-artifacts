Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly solve the problem. It first calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained by choosing `y` additional vertices. It then considers the cases where the chosen vertices are adjacent to each other, and updates the answer accordingly. Finally, it considers the cases where the chosen vertices are not adjacent to each other, and updates the answer by choosing the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `x` is 2, or when `y` is 0. It also correctly handles the case when the chosen vertices are adjacent to each other, and when they are not.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, and it correctly handles all the edge cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
