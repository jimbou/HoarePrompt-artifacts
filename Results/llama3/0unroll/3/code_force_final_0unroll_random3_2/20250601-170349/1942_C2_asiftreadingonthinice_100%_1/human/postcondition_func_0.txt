This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the minimum number of operations required to make an array a permutation of numbers from 1 to n for each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers representing the minimum number of operations required for each test case. The function performs the following actions: reads input, sorts the array, calculates the minimum number of operations required, and outputs the result for each test case.
