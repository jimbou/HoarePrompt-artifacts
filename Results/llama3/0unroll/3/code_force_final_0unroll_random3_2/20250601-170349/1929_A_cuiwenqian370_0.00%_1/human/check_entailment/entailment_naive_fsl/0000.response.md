Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order and then creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When all elements are equal, the beauty is 0.
* When there are only two elements, the beauty is the absolute difference between them.
* When there are more than two elements, the program correctly alternates between the largest and smallest remaining elements to maximize the beauty.

The program also handles edge cases, such as when the input array has only one element (although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, the program will still produce the correct result, which is 0).

Overall, the program is correct and produces the expected results for all potential cases.
