Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program first sorts the input array in ascending order. Then, it creates a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest elements from the sorted array. This is done to maximize the differences between consecutive elements, which in turn maximizes the beauty of the array.

The program then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array, which represents the maximum beauty of the array.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
