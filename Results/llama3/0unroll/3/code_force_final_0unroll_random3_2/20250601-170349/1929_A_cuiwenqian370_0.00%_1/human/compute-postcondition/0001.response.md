Output State: **left is n, right is -1, and new_arr is a list of n integers where the first half of the list contains the elements of arr in reverse order, and the second half of the list contains the elements of arr in the original order, but with the middle element (if n is odd) appended only once.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has rearranged the elements of the input list `arr` into a new list `new_arr` in a specific way. The first half of `new_arr` contains the elements of `arr` in reverse order, and the second half contains the elements of `arr` in the original order, but with the middle element (if the length of `arr` is odd) appended only once. The loop has also updated the values of `left` and `right` to `n` and `-1`, respectively, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
