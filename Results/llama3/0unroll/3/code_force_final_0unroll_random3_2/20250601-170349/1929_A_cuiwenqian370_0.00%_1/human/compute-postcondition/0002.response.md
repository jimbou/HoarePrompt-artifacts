Output State: **left is n, right is -1, new_arr is a list of n integers where the first half of the list contains the elements of arr in reverse order, and the second half of the list contains the elements of arr in the original order, but with the middle element (if n is odd) appended only once, and max_beauty is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `max_beauty` which is initialized to 0.
