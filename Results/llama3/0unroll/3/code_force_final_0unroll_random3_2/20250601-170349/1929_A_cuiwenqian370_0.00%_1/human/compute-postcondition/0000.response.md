The code snippet sorts the list `arr` in ascending order and initializes three new variables: `new_arr` as an empty list, `left` as 0, and `right` as `n - 1`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`. The sorting operation does not change the number of elements in `arr`, but it rearranges them. The initialization of `new_arr`, `left`, and `right` does not affect the values of `n` or the elements in `arr`.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 100, arr is a sorted list of n integers, each integer is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, new_arr is an empty list, left is 0, and right is n - 1.**
