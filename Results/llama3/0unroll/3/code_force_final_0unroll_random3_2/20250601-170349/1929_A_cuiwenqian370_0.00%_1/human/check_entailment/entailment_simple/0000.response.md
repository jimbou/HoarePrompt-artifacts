Reasoning: 

The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then rearranges it in a way that the first half of the array contains the elements in reverse order, and the second half contains the elements in the original order, with the middle element appended only once if the length of the array is odd. This rearrangement ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty of the array.

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the rearranged array. The use of the `abs` function ensures that the differences are always positive, which is necessary because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences, not the sum of the absolute differences.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
