Output State: **The output state will be the minimum cost to reach the final position from the starting position for each test case. The minimum cost is calculated by considering the minimum cost to reach each position from the starting position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. The minimum cost is updated at each position if the cost to reach that position is less than the current minimum cost. The final output will be the minimum cost for each test case, printed on a new line.**
