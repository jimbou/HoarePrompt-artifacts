This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, and two lists of n integers a and b. It calculates the minimum cost to reach the final position from the starting position for each test case by considering the minimum cost to reach each position from the starting position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. The function prints the minimum cost for each test case on a new line.
