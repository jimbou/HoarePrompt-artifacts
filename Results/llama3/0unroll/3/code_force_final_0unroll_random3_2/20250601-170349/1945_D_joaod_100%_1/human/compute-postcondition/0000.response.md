The code reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The input contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, where 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9.

The variable `cases` is assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer.

The output state is: `cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, where 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9.
