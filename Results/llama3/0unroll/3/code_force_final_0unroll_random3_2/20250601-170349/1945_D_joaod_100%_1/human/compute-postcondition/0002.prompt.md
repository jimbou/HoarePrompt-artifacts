You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m, where 1 <= m <= n <= 200000. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The third line contains n space-separated integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9.
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = sys.float_info.max
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: The output state will be the minimum cost to reach the final position from the starting position for each test case. The minimum cost is calculated by considering the minimum cost to reach each position from the starting position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. The minimum cost is updated at each position if the cost to reach that position is less than the current minimum cost. The final output will be the minimum cost for each test case, printed on a new line.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
