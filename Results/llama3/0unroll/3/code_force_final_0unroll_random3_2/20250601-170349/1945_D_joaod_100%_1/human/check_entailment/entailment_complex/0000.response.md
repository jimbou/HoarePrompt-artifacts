Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach the final position from the starting position. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of people in the queue (n), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (m), and the two lists of integers a and b.

2. It initializes the variables correctly, including the total cost and the best (minimum) cost.

3. The program iterates over the positions in the queue from the end to the beginning (i.e., from na_frente to 0). 

4. For each position, it checks if the current position is less than or equal to the final position. If it is, it updates the best cost if the current cost plus the cost to swap at the current position is less than the best cost.

5. Regardless of whether the current position is less than or equal to the final position, it updates the total cost by adding the minimum of the cost to swap at the current position and the cost to pass the current position.

6. Finally, it prints the best cost, which is the minimum cost for Kirill to reach the final position from the starting position.

Correctness: **True**
