Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach the final position from the starting position. The program iterates over the positions from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position and the cost to move from that position to the final position. It updates the minimum cost whenever it finds a position where the cost to reach that position plus the cost to move from that position to the final position is less than the current minimum cost. The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the cost to reach a position is less than the cost to move from that position to the final position, and when the cost to move from a position to the final position is less than the cost to reach that position.

Correctness: **True**
