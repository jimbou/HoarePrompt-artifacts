The code reads an integer `t` from the standard input, representing the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` from the standard input.

For each test case, the code calculates a sum using a generator expression. The sum is calculated as follows:

* For each integer `x` in the input, it calculates `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`, where `i` is the index of the integer in the input (0-based).
* The `//` operator performs integer division, which discards the remainder and returns the quotient.
* The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division.
* The `(i < 3)` expression is a boolean value that is `True` if `i` is less than 3 and `False` otherwise. In Python, `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0, so this expression is equivalent to `1` if `i` is less than 3 and `0` otherwise.

The sum is then divided by 3 using the `//` operator, which performs integer division.

The result of the calculation is converted to a string using the `str()` function and joined with newline characters using the `'\n'.join()` method. The resulting string is then printed to the standard output.

Output: **The results of the calculations for each test case, one per line, where each result is the sum of the calculated values for each integer in the input, divided by 3, converted to a string.**
