Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement asks to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The program correctly calculates this value by summing up the calculated values for each integer in the input and dividing the sum by 3.

2. The formula used in the program, `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)`, correctly calculates the value for each integer. This formula takes into account the number of pairs of integers that can be formed and the remaining single integer.

3. The program correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases, reads each test case, calculates the result, and prints the result for each test case.

4. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical errors.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
