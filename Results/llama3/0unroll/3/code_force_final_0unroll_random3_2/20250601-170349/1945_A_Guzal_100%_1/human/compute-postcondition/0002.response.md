Output State: The output state will be the number of groups that can be formed from the introverts, extroverts, and universals in each test case, or -1 if it is not possible to form groups. The number of groups will be the sum of the number of introverts and the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, rounded up to the nearest integer. If the total number of extroverts and universals is not a multiple of 3, 1 will be added to the total number of groups.
