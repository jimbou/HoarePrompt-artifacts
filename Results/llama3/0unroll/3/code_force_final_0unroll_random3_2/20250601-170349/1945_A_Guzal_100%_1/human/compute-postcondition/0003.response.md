Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It then calculates the number of groups that can be formed from these individuals, where each group consists of three people. If it is not possible to form groups, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the total number of groups, which is the sum of the number of introverts and the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, rounded up to the nearest integer.**
