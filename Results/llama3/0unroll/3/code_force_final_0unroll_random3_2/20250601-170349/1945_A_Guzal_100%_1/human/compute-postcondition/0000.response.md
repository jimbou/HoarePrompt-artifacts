Output State: **`n` is an integer (0 <= n <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9) â€” the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.**

In this output state, the variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, which is the number of test cases. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been read and assigned to `n`. Each remaining test case still contains three integers a, b, c, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
