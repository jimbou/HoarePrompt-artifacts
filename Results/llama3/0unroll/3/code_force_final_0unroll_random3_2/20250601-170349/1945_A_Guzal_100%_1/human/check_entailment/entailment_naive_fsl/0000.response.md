Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and if the remaining extroverts (b % 3) plus the universals (c) are less than 3. If this condition is true, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts, so it prints -1.

2. If the condition in step 1 is not met, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed by adding the number of introverts (a) to the integer division of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3 ((b + c) // 3). This is because each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

3. If there are any remaining people (i.e., (b + c) % 3 != 0), it increments the count of tents by 1. This is because these remaining people will need an additional tent.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, or where there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. 

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
