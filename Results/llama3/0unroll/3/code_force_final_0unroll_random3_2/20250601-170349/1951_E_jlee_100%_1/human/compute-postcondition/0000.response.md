The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` strings. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 <= |s| <= 10^6).**
