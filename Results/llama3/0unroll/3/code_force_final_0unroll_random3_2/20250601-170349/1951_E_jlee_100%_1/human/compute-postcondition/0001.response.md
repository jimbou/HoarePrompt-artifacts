Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each followed by either a single string (if 'YES' and the string can be split into two parts at the first character) or two strings (if 'YES' and the string can be split into two parts at a position other than the first character), or no additional strings (if 'NO'). The number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings will be equal to the initial value of `t`.**
