This function reads a series of strings from standard input, determines whether each string can be split into two parts that are identical when reversed, and prints the result. If a string can be split, it prints 'YES', the number of parts, and the parts themselves; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple strings, with the number of strings specified by the first input value.
