Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it handles all the cases as described in the problem description. 

The program first checks if the number of friends is 2, in which case it prints 2 because both friends need to be invited. 

If the number of friends is more than 2, it checks for each friend if their best friend's best friend is the friend themselves. If it finds such a pair, it prints 2 because inviting these two friends will result in at least two friends coming to the party. 

If it doesn't find such a pair, it prints 3 because in the worst case, inviting three friends will result in at least two friends coming to the party. 

This solution is correct because it covers all the possible cases and always prints the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least two friends come to the party. 

The program's logic is sound and it doesn't contain any errors. It correctly implements the problem's requirements and handles all the edge cases. 

Therefore, the program is correct and the answer is True.
