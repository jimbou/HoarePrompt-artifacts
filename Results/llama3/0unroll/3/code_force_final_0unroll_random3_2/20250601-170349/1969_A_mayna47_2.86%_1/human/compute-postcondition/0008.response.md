Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers from the second line of the test case, with each integer between 1 and n inclusive and not equal to its 1-based index. If n equals 2, then 2 is printed. Otherwise, the loop will print 2 and terminate as soon as it finds an index i such that v[v[v[i]]] equals i. If no such index is found after iterating over all indices from 1 to n, the loop will finish without printing anything, and the number 3 is being printed.***
