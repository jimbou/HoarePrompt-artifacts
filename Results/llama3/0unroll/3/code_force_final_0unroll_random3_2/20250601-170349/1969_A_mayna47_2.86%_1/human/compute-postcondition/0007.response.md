Output: **The loop will print 2 and terminate as soon as it finds an index i such that v[v[v[i]]] equals i. If no such index is found after iterating over all indices from 1 to n, the loop will finish without printing anything. The value of n and the list v remain unchanged, and the number 3 is being printed**
