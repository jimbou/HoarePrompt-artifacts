Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to his friends so that at least 2 of them come to the party.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and then reads the list of best friends `v`.

3. If `n` is 2, it directly prints 2 because in this case, Monocarp needs to send invitations to both friends.

4. If `n` is greater than 2, it checks for each friend `i` whether `v[v[v[i]]]` equals `i`. This condition checks whether there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships. If such a cycle is found, it prints 2 because Monocarp can send invitations to the two friends in the cycle and both will come to the party.

5. If no cycle of length 3 is found, it prints 3. This is because in the absence of a cycle of length 3, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them come to the party.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
