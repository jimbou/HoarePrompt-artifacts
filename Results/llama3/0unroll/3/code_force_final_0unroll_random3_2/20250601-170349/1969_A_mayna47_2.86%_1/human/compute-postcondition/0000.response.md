Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, v is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the n distinct integers from the second line of the test case, with each integer between 1 and n inclusive and not equal to its 1-based index.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is reduced by 1 because one test case has been processed. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, as specified in the precondition. The list `v` now contains `n+1` integers, where the first element is 0 (as initialized in the code) and the remaining elements are the `n` distinct integers from the second line of the test case. Each of these integers is between 1 and `n` inclusive and is not equal to its 1-based index, as specified in the precondition.
