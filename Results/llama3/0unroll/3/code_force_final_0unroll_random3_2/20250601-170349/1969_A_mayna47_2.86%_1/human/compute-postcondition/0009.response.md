Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, where the test case consists of an integer n and a list of n distinct integers. It then checks for a specific condition in the list, and if the condition is met, it prints 2. If the condition is not met and n is not equal to 2, it prints 3. If n is equal to 2, it only prints 2. The function does not modify the input values and does not return any value, only printing the result to the standard output.**
