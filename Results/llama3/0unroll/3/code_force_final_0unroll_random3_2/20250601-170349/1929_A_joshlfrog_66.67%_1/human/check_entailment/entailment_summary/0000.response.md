Reasoning: The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. The maximum beauty is achieved when the array is rearranged in ascending order, and the beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array and calculates their difference, which is the maximum beauty.

Correctness: **True**
