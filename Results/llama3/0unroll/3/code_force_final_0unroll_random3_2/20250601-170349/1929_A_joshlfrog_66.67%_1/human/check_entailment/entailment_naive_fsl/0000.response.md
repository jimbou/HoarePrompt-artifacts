Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, not just the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

For example, if the input is [1, 3, 2], the program will output 2 (3 - 1), but the correct output should be 3 (3 - 1 + 2 - 3).

To correctly calculate the maximum beauty, the program should sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
