Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin consists of `t` test cases, each of which starts with an integer `n` (between 2 and 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each between 1 and 10^9).
