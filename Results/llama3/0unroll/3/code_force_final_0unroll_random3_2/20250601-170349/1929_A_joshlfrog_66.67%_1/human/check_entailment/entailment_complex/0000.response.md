Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize this sum, the elements should be arranged in ascending order. The given program correctly implements this approach by finding the maximum and minimum values in each test case and printing their difference.

However, the program can be optimized by using the built-in `max` and `min` functions in Python, which would eliminate the need for the inner loop that finds the maximum and minimum values.

Correctness: **True**
