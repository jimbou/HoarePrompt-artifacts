Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by finding the maximum and minimum elements in the array and then subtracting the minimum from the maximum. However, this approach is incorrect.

The issue with the program is that it only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, whereas the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program does not take into account the order of the elements in the array.

For example, consider the input array [1, 3, 2]. The program would find the maximum element (3) and the minimum element (1) and calculate the beauty as 3 - 1 = 2. However, the correct beauty of the array would be (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **False**
