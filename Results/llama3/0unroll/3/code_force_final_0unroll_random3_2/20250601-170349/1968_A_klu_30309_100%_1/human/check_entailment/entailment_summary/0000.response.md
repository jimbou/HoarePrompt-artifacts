Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the test cases themselves.
2. For each test case `x`, it iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
3. For each `y`, it calculates the GCD of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function.
4. It keeps track of the maximum sum of GCD and `y` found so far, as well as the corresponding `y` value.
5. Once it finds a `y` that gives a maximum sum, it breaks out of the loop and moves on to the next test case.
6. The program correctly returns a list of `y` values, one for each test case, that maximize the sum of GCD and `y`.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, and the example output matches the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
