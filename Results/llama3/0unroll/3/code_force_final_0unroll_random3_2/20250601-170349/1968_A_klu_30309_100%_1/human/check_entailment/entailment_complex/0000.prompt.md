Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

# Annotated Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers, the length of test_cases is equal to t, and each integer in test_cases is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 1000.
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers, the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, and each integer in `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 1000, `results` is a list of integers, the length of `results` is equal to `t`, and each integer in `results` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where the length of the list is equal to the value of 't', which is a positive integer, and each integer in the list is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer 't' and a list of integers 'test_cases' as input, where the length of 'test_cases' is equal to 't' and each integer in 'test_cases' is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each integer in 'test_cases' with all smaller integers, and returns a list of integers representing the smallest integer 'y' for each 'x' in 'test_cases' such that the sum of the GCD of 'x' and 'y' plus 'y' is maximized. The returned list has the same length as 'test_cases', and each integer in the list is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
