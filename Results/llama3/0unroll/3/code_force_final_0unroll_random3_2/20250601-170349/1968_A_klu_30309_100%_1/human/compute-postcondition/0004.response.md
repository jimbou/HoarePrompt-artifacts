Functionality: **This function takes a positive integer 't' and a list of integers 'test_cases' as input, where the length of 'test_cases' is equal to 't' and each integer in 'test_cases' is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive). It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each integer in 'test_cases' with all smaller integers, and returns a list of integers representing the smallest integer 'y' for each 'x' in 'test_cases' such that the sum of the GCD of 'x' and 'y' plus 'y' is maximized. The returned list has the same length as 'test_cases', and each integer in the list is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.**
