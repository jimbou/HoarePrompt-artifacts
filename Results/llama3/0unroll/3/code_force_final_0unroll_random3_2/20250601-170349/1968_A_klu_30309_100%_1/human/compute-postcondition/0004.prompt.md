You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of integers, the length of test_cases is equal to t, and each integer in test_cases is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 1000.
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers, the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, and each integer in `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 1000, `results` is a list of integers, the length of `results` is equal to `t`, and each integer in `results` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where the length of the list is equal to the value of 't', which is a positive integer, and each integer in the list is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers, where the length of the list is equal to the value of 't', which is a positive integer, and each integer in the list is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
