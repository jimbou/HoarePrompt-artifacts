The code creates an empty list called `results`. This list is initially empty, meaning it does not contain any elements.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of integers, the length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`, and each integer in `test_cases` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 1000, `results` is an empty list.**
