Correctness: **False** 

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly check if it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

The program only checks if the count of elements in each array that are less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to k/2. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that every integer from 1 to k is included among the chosen elements.

For example, consider the input:

6 5 6
2 3 8 5 6 5
1 3 4 10 5

The program will output "YES" because the count of elements in each array that are less than or equal to 6 is greater than or equal to 3. However, it is not possible to choose exactly 3 elements from each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to 6 is included.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a different approach, such as using sets to keep track of the elements that are present in each array, and then checking if the union of the two sets contains all integers from 1 to k.
