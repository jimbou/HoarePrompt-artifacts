Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on certain conditions. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function iterates over a series of test cases, each containing integers n, m, k, and two lists of integers a and b. It counts the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k and checks if these counts meet certain conditions (count_a >= d and count_b >= d). If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output based on the conditions evaluated.**
