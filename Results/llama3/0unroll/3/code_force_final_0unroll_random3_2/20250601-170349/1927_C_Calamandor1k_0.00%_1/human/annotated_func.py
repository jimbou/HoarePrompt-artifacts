#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) and m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_j <= 10^6).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the conditions count_a >= d and count_b >= d are met. The values of t, n, m, k, a, and b will remain unchanged. The loop will iterate t times, and the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' statements, one for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on certain conditions. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function iterates over a series of test cases, each containing integers n, m, k, and two lists of integers a and b. It counts the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k and checks if these counts meet certain conditions (count_a >= d and count_b >= d). If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output based on the conditions evaluated.
