Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the position of the road in the village of Letovo such that at least half of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of 0s and 1s from standard input, calculates the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s in the string, and then finds the index where the absolute difference between the middle of the string and the current index is minimized, considering the balance of 0s and 1s on both sides of the index. It prints the index that satisfies this condition.

`func_2` reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer representing the number of houses and a string of 0s and 1s, and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s, checks the balance of 0s and 1s on both sides of each index, and finds the index that minimizes the absolute difference between the middle of the string and the current index.

Correctness: **True**
