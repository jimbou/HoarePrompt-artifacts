Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the index where the road should be laid to satisfy the condition of having at least half of the residents on each side of the village satisfied with the choice. The program iterates through the string 'a' and calculates the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s. It then checks for each index 'i' if the condition is satisfied and updates the answer if the absolute difference between the middle of the string and the current index is minimized. The program also handles the case where the road can be laid before the first house or after the last house. The main function, func_2, reads a series of test cases from standard input and processes each test case using func_1.

Correctness: **True**
