Output State: The value of variable 'S' is a list containing n+1 lists, each containing two elements: the count of 0's and 1's encountered in the string 'a' up to that point, respectively. The value of variable 'a' is unchanged. The value of variable 'n' is unchanged. The value of variable 'ans' is the index 'i' that satisfies the condition abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans) and has the maximum value of 'i' that satisfies the condition left * 2 >= lsum and right * 2 >= rsum. The value of variable 'satisfy' is unchanged. Stdin is empty.
