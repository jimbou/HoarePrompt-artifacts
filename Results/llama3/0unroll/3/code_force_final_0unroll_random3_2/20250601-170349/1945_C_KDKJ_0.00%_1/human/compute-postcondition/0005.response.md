Output State: The value of variable 'S' is a list containing n+1 lists, each containing two elements: the count of 0's and 1's encountered in the string 'a' up to that point, respectively. The value of variable 'a' is unchanged. The value of variable 'n' is unchanged. The value of variable 'ans' is the index 'i' where the condition 'abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)' is satisfied and either 'left * 2 >= lsum' and 'right * 2 >= rsum' or 'left * 2 < lsum' and 'right * 2 < rsum'. The value of variable 'satisfy' is unchanged. Stdin is empty.
