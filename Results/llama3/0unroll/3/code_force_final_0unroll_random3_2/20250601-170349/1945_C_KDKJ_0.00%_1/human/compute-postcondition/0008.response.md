Functionality: **The function reads an integer and a string of 0s and 1s from standard input, calculates the cumulative counts of 0s and 1s in the string, and then finds the index where the absolute difference between the middle of the string and the current index is minimized, considering the balance of 0s and 1s on both sides of the index. It prints the index that satisfies this condition.**
