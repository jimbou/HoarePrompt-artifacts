#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer, a and b are non-negative integers, n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b).
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans <= n * max(a, b)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the calculated answer (k * b + (n - k) * a) is less than or equal to the product of n and the maximum of a and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates a weighted sum of two values, 'a' and 'b', based on the proportion 'k' out of 'n', and returns whether this sum is less than or equal to the product of 'n' and the maximum of 'a' and 'b'.
