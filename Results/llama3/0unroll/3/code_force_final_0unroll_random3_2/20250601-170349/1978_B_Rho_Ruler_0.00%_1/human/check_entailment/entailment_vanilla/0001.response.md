Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem using a binary search approach. However, the implementation is incorrect.

The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the profit for a given value of `k`. However, the calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining `n-k` buns.

The condition in the `while` loop is also incorrect. The loop is supposed to find the maximum value of `k` that results in a profit less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. However, the condition `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` is not checking this correctly.

Moreover, the program is not correctly calculating the maximum profit. The maximum profit should be the maximum value of the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining `n-k` buns, not the value of `k` itself.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
