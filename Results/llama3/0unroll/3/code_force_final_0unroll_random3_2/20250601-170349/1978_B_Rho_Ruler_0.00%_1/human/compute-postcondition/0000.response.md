Output State: **k is an integer, a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer, n is a non-negative integer, ans is an integer equal to k * b + (n - k) * a**

In this output state, the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The variable `ans` is introduced and its value is calculated based on the given formula, which takes into account the values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. The final value of `ans` is the sum of two products: `k` multiplied by `b` and `(n - k)` multiplied by `a`.
