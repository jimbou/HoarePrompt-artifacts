Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing a single integer n representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates a sum value and a number (n + r), where r is determined based on the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n. It then prints the sum value and (n + r) followed by multiple lines of numbers arranged in a specific pattern. The function repeats this process for each test case, producing multiple sets of output.**
