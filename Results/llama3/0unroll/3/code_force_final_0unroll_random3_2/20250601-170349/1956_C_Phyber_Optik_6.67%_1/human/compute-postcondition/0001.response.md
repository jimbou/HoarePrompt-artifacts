To determine the output state after all executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the state.

The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer provided as input. In each iteration, it reads an integer `n` from the input and performs a series of calculations and print operations based on `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the loop does:

1. **Initialization**: It sets `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0. These variables are used to accumulate a sum and keep track of a value `r`, respectively.

2. **Inner Loop 1**: It iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each `i` in this range, it checks if the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true. If true, it updates `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`. If the condition is false, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.

3. **Printing**: After the inner loop, it prints the current value of `sum` followed by `n + r`.

4. **Inner Loop 2**: It iterates from 1 to `n + r` (inclusive). For each `j` in this range, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `1`, `j`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints `2`, `j % n`, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given this understanding, the output state after all executions of the loop have finished will depend on the values of `t` and the `n` values provided in the input for each iteration. However, since the problem asks for a description of the output state in a format similar to the initial execution state and does not provide specific values for `t` and `n`, we can describe the output state in general terms.

Output State: **The output will consist of multiple lines of output for each iteration of the outer loop (t times). Each set of output for an iteration will start with a line containing a sum value and a number (n + r), followed by multiple lines of numbers. The exact numbers and their arrangement depend on the values of n provided in the input. The state of variables not affected by the loop (e.g., t after the loop finishes) remains unchanged.**
