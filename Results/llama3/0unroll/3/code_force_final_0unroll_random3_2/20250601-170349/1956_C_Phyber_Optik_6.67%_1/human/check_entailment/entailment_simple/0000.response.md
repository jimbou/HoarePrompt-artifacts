Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program iterates over each test case, calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations required, and then prints the result.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers. It calculates the maximum sum by iterating over each row and column, and then prints the result along with the operations required to achieve it.

The program's output format matches the problem's requirements, with each test case's output starting with a line containing the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by multiple lines describing the operations.

Based on the provided execution states, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations required for each test case, and prints the result in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
