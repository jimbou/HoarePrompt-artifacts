Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations.

The program calculates the maximum sum by iterating over the range from 1 to n and adding the product of the current number and n to the sum if the product is greater than the current sum. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal arrangement of numbers in the matrix.

For example, when n = 3, the program calculates the maximum sum as 12 (3 * 4), but the optimal arrangement of numbers in the matrix is:

1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2

which has a sum of 15. The program's approach does not consider this optimal arrangement and therefore produces an incorrect result.

Additionally, the program's calculation of the number of operations is also incorrect. The program simply adds the number of rows (n) to the number of columns (r), but this does not accurately represent the number of operations required to achieve the maximum sum.

Overall, the program does not correctly solve the problem and produces incorrect results for certain inputs.
