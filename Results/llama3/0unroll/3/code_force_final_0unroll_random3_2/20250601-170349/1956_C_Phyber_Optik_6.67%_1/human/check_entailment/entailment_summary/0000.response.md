Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum. It then prints the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.

The program's logic is based on the idea of filling the matrix with the largest possible numbers. It starts by calculating the maximum sum that can be achieved by filling the first row with the numbers 1 to n, and then filling the remaining rows with the numbers 1 to n in a cyclic manner. This approach ensures that the sum of the numbers in the matrix is maximized.

The program's output format matches the problem's requirements, with the maximum sum and the number of operations printed on the first line, followed by the operations themselves. Each operation is represented by a line containing the type of operation (1 for row operation or 2 for column operation), the row or column index, and the permutation of numbers used in the operation.

Based on the execution summary, the program produces the correct output for the given test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
