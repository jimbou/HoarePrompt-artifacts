Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved and the number of operations required to achieve it.

The program first calculates the maximum sum by iterating over the range from 1 to n and adding the maximum possible value for each row. If the current row can be filled with the maximum possible values (i.e., n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n), it adds the sum of the maximum possible values for the entire row to the total sum. Otherwise, it adds the sum of the current row's values to the total sum.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve it. The number of operations is calculated as n + r, where r is the number of rows that can be filled with the maximum possible values.

The program then prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. For each row, it prints a line starting with "1" (indicating a Type 1 operation), followed by the row number, and then the permutation of numbers from 1 to n. For each column, it prints a line starting with "2" (indicating a Type 2 operation), followed by the column number, and then the permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The program correctly handles the case where n is 1, in which case the maximum sum is 1 and only one operation is required.

Therefore, the given program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
