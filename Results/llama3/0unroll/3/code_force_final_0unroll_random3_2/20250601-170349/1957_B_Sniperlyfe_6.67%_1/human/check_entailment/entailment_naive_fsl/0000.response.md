Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is 1 and `k` is any value. In this case, the program should return a single integer `k`, but instead, it returns an incorrect result.

For example, when `n` is 1 and `k` is 5, the program returns `[31]` instead of `[5]`. This is because the program is trying to distribute the value of `k` among `n` numbers, but when `n` is 1, it should simply return `k` as the only number in the sequence.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
