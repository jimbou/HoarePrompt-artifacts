This function generates a list of n integers where all integers except the last one are the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits minus 1, and the last integer is the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits minus 1 plus the remaining value of k. The function takes two integers n and k as input, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9, and returns the generated list of integers.
