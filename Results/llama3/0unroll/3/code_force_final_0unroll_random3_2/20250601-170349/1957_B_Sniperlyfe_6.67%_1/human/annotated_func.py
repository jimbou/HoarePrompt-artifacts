#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < 1 << k.bit_length() - 1, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list of n integers where all integers except the last one are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, and the last integer is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of n integers where all integers except the last one are the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits minus 1, and the last integer is the maximum possible value that can be represented by k bits minus 1 plus the remaining value of k. The function takes two integers n and k as input, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9, and returns the generated list of integers.
