Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of n zeros**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The code creates a new list `nums` with `n` elements, all initialized to zero. The length of the list `nums` is equal to the value of `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
