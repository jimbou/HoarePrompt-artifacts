Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < 1 << k.bit_length() - 1, `nums` is a list of n integers where all integers except the last one are (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, and the last integer is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains the same, and the value of `k` also remains the same. The list `nums` is updated such that the last integer in the list is incremented by the value of `k`. All other integers in the list remain the same, which is (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.
