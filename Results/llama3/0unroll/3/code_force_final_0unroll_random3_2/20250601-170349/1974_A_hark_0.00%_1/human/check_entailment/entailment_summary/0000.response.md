Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. 

`func_1` is a simple function that compares two integers and returns the smaller one. However, this function is not used anywhere in the program.

`func_2` is the core function that performs the calculations to determine the minimum number of screens needed. It reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` from standard input, representing the number of applications with 1x1 icons and 2x2 icons, respectively. It then performs calculations based on the values of `x` and `y` and prints the result.

`func_3` is the main function that reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then calls `func_2` `t` times, without modifying the state of `func_2` or standard input.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input. The calculations performed in `func_2` are correct, and the program handles all possible cases, including when `x` and `y` are both greater than 0, when `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, when `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, and when both `x` and `y` are 0.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
