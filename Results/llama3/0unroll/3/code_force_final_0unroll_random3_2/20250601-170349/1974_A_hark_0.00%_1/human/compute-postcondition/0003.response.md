The code prints the sum of two variables, `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory`. 

`bxsfory1` is an integer between 0 and 26, and `bxsfory` is an integer between 1 and 50.

Since the exact values of `bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of their sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of these two variables.

Output: **sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory (where bxsfory1 is an integer between 0 and 26 and bxsfory is an integer between 1 and 50)**
