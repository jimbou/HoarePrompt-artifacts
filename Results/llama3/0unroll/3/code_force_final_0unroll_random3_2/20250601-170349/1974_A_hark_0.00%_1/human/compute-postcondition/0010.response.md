Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 0 and 99, `y` is an integer between 0 and 99, stdin is empty. Either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0 or both `x` and `y` are 0. It is not the case that `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0. The current value of `x` is greater than 0 and the current value of `y` is 0.***
