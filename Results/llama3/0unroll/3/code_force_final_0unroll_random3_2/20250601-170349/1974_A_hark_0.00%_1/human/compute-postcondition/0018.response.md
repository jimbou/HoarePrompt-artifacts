Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, stdin is empty. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the sum of bxsfory1 and bxsfory is printed, where the sum is an integer between 1 and 76. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the smallest integer not less than y/2 is printed. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the ceiling of the division of `x` by 15 is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.**
