Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop consists of multiple screens, each represented as a 5x3 grid. There are two types of application icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

The program uses three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` is not used anywhere in the program, so it can be ignored.

`func_2` takes the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`) as input. It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place these icons. The calculation involves the following steps:

1. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`). It then subtracts the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on the same screens as the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory * 15 - y * 4`). If the result is positive, it calculates the number of additional screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`). The total number of screens needed is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
2. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
3. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it calculates the number of screens needed to place the 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`).
4. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

`func_3` takes the number of test cases (`t`) as input and calls `func_2` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the application icons. It handles all possible cases and edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
