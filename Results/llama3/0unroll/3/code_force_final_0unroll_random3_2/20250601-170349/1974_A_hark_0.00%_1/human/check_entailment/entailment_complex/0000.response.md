Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop, given the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

`func_1` is not relevant to the problem, as it only compares two integers and returns the smaller one.

`func_2` reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` from standard input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It then performs calculations based on the values of `x` and `y` and prints the result. The calculations seem to be correct, as they take into account the size of the icons and the number of screens needed to accommodate them.

`func_3` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and calls `func_2` that many times.

The program seems to be correct, as it reads the input values, performs the necessary calculations, and prints the result for each test case. The calculations in `func_2` appear to be correct, and the program does not seem to have any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
