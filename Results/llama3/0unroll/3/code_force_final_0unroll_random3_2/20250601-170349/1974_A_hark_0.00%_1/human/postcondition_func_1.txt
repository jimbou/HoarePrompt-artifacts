The function reads two space-separated integers x and y from standard input, where 0 <= x <= 99 and 0 <= y <= 99. It then performs calculations based on the values of x and y, and prints the result. If both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates the sum of two values, bxsfory and bxsfory1, and prints the sum. If x is 0 and y is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of y divided by 2. If x is greater than 0 and y is 0, it prints the ceiling of x divided by 15. If both x and y are 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to perform these calculations and print the result based on the input values.
