The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains t test cases, after this line, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The second line initializes an empty list `buffer`.

Output State: **t is an integer, buffer is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
