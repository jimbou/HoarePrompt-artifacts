This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose three distinct numbers from the given list and prints the result. If the list contains less than three elements, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
