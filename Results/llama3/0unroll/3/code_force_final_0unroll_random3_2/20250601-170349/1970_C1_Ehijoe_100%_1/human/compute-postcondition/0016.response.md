Postcondition: **The variables "s", "e", "tree", "prev", "curr", "i", "nodes", "ends", and "stdin" retain their values as described in the precondition. The variable "start" is equal to the integer read from stdin, and the variable "idx" is equal to the index of the start node in the tree. The variable "moves" is a list containing the index of the start node and the number of moves required to reach the end of the tree from the start node. If at least one move in the list "moves" has an odd value, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all moves in the list "moves" are even, and 'Hermione' is printed.**
