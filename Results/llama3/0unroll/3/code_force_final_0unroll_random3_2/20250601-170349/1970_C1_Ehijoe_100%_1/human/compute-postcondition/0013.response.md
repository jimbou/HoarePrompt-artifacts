Postcondition: ***The variable "s" is still equal to the first node in the list "ends", the variable "e" is still equal to the second node in the list "ends", the variable "tree" is now a list containing all the nodes in the path from the first node in the list "ends" to the second node in the list "ends" and also contains the second node in the list "ends", the variable "prev" is still equal to the second node in the list "ends", and the variable "curr" is still equal to the second node in the list "ends". The variable "i" is still equal to n - 1, the variable "nodes" is still a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, the variable "ends" is still a list of nodes that have only one adjacent node, and the variable "stdin" is now empty because it contained one integer that was read. Additionally, the variable "start" is now equal to the integer that was read from stdin, the variable "idx" is now equal to the index of the start node in the tree, and the variable "moves" is now a list containing the index of the start node and the number of moves required to reach the end of the tree from the start node. All moves in the list "moves" are even.***
