Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The variable "s" is now equal to the first node in the list "ends", the variable "e" is now equal to the second node in the list "ends", the variable "tree" is now a list containing the first node in the list "ends", the variable "prev" is now equal to the first node in the list "ends", and the variable "curr" is now equal to the first adjacent node of the first node in the list "ends" as specified in the defaultdict "nodes". The variable "i" is still equal to n - 1, the variable "nodes" is still a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, the variable "ends" is still a list of nodes that have only one adjacent node, and the variable "stdin" is still empty.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
