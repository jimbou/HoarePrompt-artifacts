Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t, where n is an integer between 2 and 200000 inclusive and t is 1, then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n inclusive, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.

        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: The variable "i" is now equal to n - 1, the variable "nodes" is now a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, and the variable "stdin" is now empty.

    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:

        if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][1]
        else:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][0]
        
    #State: Output State: The variable "s" is still equal to the first node in the list "ends", the variable "e" is still equal to the second node in the list "ends", the variable "tree" is now a list containing all the nodes in the path from the first node in the list "ends" to the second node in the list "ends", the variable "prev" is now equal to the second node in the list "ends", and the variable "curr" is now equal to the second node in the list "ends". The variable "i" is still equal to n - 1, the variable "nodes" is still a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, the variable "ends" is still a list of nodes that have only one adjacent node, and the variable "stdin" is still empty.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable "tree" now contains all the nodes in the path from the first node in the list "ends" to the second node in the list "ends", and the variables "prev" and "curr" are now equal to the second node in the list "ends". The other variables remain unchanged.

        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: The variables "s", "e", "tree", "prev", "curr", "i", "nodes", "ends", and "stdin" retain their values as described in the precondition. The variable "start" is equal to the integer read from stdin, and the variable "idx" is equal to the index of the start node in the tree. The variable "moves" is a list containing the index of the start node and the number of moves required to reach the end of the tree from the start node. If at least one move in the list "moves" has an odd value, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all moves in the list "moves" are even, and 'Hermione' is printed.
