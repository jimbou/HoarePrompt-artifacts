Output State: **The variable "i" is now equal to n - 1, the variable "nodes" is now a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, the variable "ends" is now an empty list, and the variable "stdin" is now empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable "i" remains equal to n - 1, the variable "nodes" remains a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, a new empty list "ends" is created, and the variable "stdin" remains empty.
