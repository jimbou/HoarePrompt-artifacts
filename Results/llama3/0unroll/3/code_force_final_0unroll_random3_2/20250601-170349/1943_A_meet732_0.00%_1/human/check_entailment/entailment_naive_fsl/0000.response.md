Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game strategy to maximize the MEX of Alice's array. It first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using the `cntl` list. If 0 is not present in the array, the MEX is 0. Otherwise, it starts from 2 (since 0 and 1 are already present) and decrements it for each number that appears less than twice in the array. The game ends when the count reaches 0 or the end of the array is reached, and the current number is printed as the MEX.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When 0 is not present in the array, it correctly prints 0.
* When 0 is present, it correctly starts from 2 and decrements it for each number that appears less than twice.
* When a number appears only once, it correctly decrements the count.
* When the end of the array is reached, it correctly prints the current number as the MEX.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
