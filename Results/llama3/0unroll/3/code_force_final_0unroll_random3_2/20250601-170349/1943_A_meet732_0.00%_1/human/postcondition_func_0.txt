This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an array of integers. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal to 0, or -1 if it's impossible to do so. The function iterates through each test case, counting the occurrences of each integer in the array, and then determines the minimum number of operations needed to reduce all elements to 0. If it's impossible to make all elements equal to 0, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum number of operations required.
