You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of stdin contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break
        
    #State: The output state will contain t number of lines, each containing a single integer. This integer represents the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array a_i equal to 0, or -1 if it's impossible to do so.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
