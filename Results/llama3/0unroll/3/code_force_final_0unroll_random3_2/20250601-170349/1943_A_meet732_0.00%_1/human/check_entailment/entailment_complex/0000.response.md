Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program first counts the occurrences of each integer in the array. If 0 does not occur, the score is 0. Otherwise, it checks if 0 occurs at least twice. If it does, the score is at least 1. Then, it iterates through the array, checking if each integer occurs at least twice. If it finds an integer that occurs less than twice, it decrements the score. If the score becomes 0 or it reaches the end of the array, it prints the current integer as the score.

The program correctly handles the cases where the score is 0, 1, or greater than 1. It also correctly handles the case where the array contains only one 0.

Correctness: **True**
