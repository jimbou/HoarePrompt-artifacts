Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided problem description. The program iterates through all test cases, processes each one independently, and outputs the result of each test case.

The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum score for each player. It first constructs the paths for both players by following the permutation, then calculates the maximum score for each player by considering all possible moves.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the game lasts for k turns, and the case where the players have the same score.

Correctness: **True**
