Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four lines of input. It calculates the maximum value of two expressions, resb and ress, based on the input values and prints the winner of each test case, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', depending on which expression has a higher maximum value. The function iterates through all test cases, processing each one independently, and outputs the result of each test case.**
