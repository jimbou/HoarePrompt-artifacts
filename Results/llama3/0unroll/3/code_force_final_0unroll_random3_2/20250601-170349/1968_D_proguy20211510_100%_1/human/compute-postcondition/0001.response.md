Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the values of 'YES', 'NO', 'MOD', and 'alpha' remain unchanged as 'YES', 'NO', 1000000007, and 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' respectively. The stdin is empty as all the test cases have been processed. The loop has printed the winner of each test case, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', based on the maximum value of the calculated expressions resb and ress for each test case.**
