Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the problem description. The program iterates through all test cases, processes each one independently, and outputs the result of each test case.

The program correctly calculates the maximum value of the expressions resb and ress for each test case, which represents the maximum score that Bodya and Sasha can achieve, respectively. It then compares these maximum values to determine the winner of each test case.

The program also correctly handles the case where the game lasts for k turns, where k can be a large number. It uses a while loop to traverse the permutation and calculate the score for each position, and it uses a for loop to calculate the maximum value of the expressions resb and ress.

The program also correctly handles the case where the permutation contains cycles. It uses a visited array to keep track of the positions that have been visited, and it breaks out of the while loop when it encounters a position that has already been visited.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
