Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The `test_cases` list also remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases, each with a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `results`, which is initialized as an empty list.
