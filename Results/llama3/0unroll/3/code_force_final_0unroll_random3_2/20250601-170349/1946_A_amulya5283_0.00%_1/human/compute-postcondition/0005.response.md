Functionality: **This function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input, where each test case is a list containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers. It sorts each test case's list of integers, finds the median, and then increments the smallest number in the second half of the sorted list until it is greater than the median. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of operations performed on the corresponding test case to make all elements in the second half of the sorted array greater than the median.**
