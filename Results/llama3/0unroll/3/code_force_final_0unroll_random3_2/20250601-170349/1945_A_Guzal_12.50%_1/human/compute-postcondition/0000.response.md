Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` lines, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `n` lines, each containing three integers a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9). The values of the other variables are not affected.
