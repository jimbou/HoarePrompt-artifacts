Output State: **The output state will contain `n` lines, each containing an integer. The integer on each line will be the calculated value of `k` for the corresponding input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `k` is calculated as `a` plus the integer division of `b + c` by 3, plus 1 if the remainder of `b + c` divided by 3 is not 0. If the conditions `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` are met, the output will be -1 instead. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged.**
