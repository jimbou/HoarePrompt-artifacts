Output State: **t is 0, and the output of each test case is printed to the console.**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations, and the value of `t` has been decremented to 0. For each test case, the code inside the loop has been executed, and the result ('YES' or 'NO') has been printed to the console. The initial state of `t` being a positive integer less than or equal to 50 and the presence of multiple test cases in stdin remain unchanged.
