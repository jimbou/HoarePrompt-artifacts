The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a binary string of the same length as the integer. The integer is a positive integer less than or equal to 50. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains one input: a binary string of the same length as the integer.**
