Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "MOOO! - Doja Cat" problem, which involves constructing a permutation `p` based on an array `a`. The program uses a loop to iterate over the array `a` and calculates the minimum excluded value (`mex`) for each iteration. The `mex` value is then used to construct the permutation `p`.

The program correctly handles the two cases mentioned in the problem statement:

1.  When `a_i > 0`, the program appends the current `minn` value to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it updates `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
2.  When `a_i <= 0`, the program appends the absolute difference between `abs(a_i)` and `minn` to the `mex` list. If this value is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.

The program then prints the calculated `mex` values, which represent the permutation `p`.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum excluded value for each iteration.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
