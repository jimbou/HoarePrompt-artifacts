This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum excluded value for each iteration. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The input is expected to contain an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n). The function processes each test case, calculating the minimum excluded value for each iteration, and prints these values separated by spaces. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
