Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n <= a_i <= n). n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, mex is an empty list, minn is 0, maxx is 0.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, leaving `t-1` test cases in stdin. The second line reads `n` integers from stdin and assigns them to `arr`, leaving no integers in stdin for this test case. The third line initializes an empty list `mex`. The fourth and fifth lines initialize `minn` and `maxx` to 0, respectively.
