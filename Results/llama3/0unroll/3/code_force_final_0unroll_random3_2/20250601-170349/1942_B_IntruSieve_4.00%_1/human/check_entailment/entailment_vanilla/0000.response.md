Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation p based on an array a, where a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i. The program uses a greedy approach to construct the permutation.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation (n) and the array a.

3. It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the constructed permutation and two variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

4. It then iterates over the array a. If the current element is positive, it appends the current `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` to `maxx + 1`.

5. If the current element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the current element and `minn` to the `mex` list. If this value is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.

6. Finally, it prints the constructed permutation.

The program's approach is correct because it ensures that the constructed permutation satisfies the condition a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i. The use of `minn` and `maxx` variables helps to maintain the correct order of elements in the permutation.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the case where the current element is negative, the program appends the absolute difference between the current element and `minn` to the `mex` list. This is incorrect because it should append the value that makes the equation a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i true.

Correctness: **False**
