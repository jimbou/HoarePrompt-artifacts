Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation p based on the given array a. The issue lies in the way the mex (minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array) is calculated and updated.

In the given program, the mex is calculated as the minimum non-negative integer that does not appear in the array, but it does not consider the case when the mex is equal to the current index i. In such cases, the mex should be updated to the next non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

For example, consider the input array a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]. The program will calculate the mex as [0, 1, 4, 2, 3], but the correct mex should be [0, 1, 3, 2, 4].

A correct implementation would involve maintaining a set of used indices and updating the mex accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    used = set()
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(min(j for j in range(n) if j not in used))
            used.add(mex[-1])
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - min(j for j in range(n) if j not in used)))
            used.add(mex[-1])
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```

This corrected program maintains a set of used indices and updates the mex accordingly, ensuring that the constructed permutation p satisfies the given array a.
