Output State: The loop iterates over the list of integers 'arr' of length 'n'. If an integer is positive, it appends the current value of 'minn' to the list 'mex', increments 'minn' by 1, and if 'minn' equals 'maxx', it increments 'minn' by 1 again. If an integer is not positive, it appends the absolute difference between the integer and 'minn' to 'mex', and if this difference is greater than 'maxx', it updates 'maxx' with this difference. After the loop finishes, 'mex' contains the calculated values, 'minn' is the maximum value it reached during the loop, and 'maxx' is the maximum absolute difference between any non-positive integer and 'minn'. The rest of the state remains unchanged.
