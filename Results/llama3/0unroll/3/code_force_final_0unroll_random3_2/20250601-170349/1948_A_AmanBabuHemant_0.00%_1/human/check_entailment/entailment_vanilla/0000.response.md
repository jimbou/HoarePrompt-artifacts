Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program uses the string '110' to build the answer, but this string contains digits, not uppercase Latin letters. The problem statement specifically asks for uppercase Latin letters.

2. The program checks if the length of the string '110' * (n // 2) is less than 200, but this check is unnecessary. The problem statement guarantees that if a solution exists, it will have a length of at most 200.

3. The program does not handle the case where n is 0 correctly. Although the problem statement does not explicitly mention this case, it is a valid input. The program should print 'YES' and an empty string in this case.

4. The program does not handle the case where n is a multiple of 2 but not a multiple of 4 correctly. In this case, the program should print 'YES' and a string with n special characters.

5. The program does not handle the case where n is greater than 100 correctly. In this case, the program should print 'NO' because it is impossible to build a string with more than 100 special characters using uppercase Latin letters.

Correctness: **False**
