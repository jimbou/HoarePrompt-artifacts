Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case is an integer representing the number of special characters. It then determines whether the number of special characters is even and less than 200. If it is, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string of '110' repeated n/2 times. If the number of special characters is odd or 200 or more, the function prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.**
