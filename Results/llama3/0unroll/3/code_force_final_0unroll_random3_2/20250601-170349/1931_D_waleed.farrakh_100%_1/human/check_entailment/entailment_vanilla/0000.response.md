Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The provided program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), the favorite integers x and y, and the array itself. The function iterates over each test case, initializes a frequency dictionary (freq) to store the counts of pairs with the same remainder when divided by x and y, and a count variable to store the total number of beautiful pairs.

For each element in the array, the function calculates the remainder when the element is divided by x (rx) and the remainder when the element is divided by y (ry). It then checks if the pair (rx, ry) is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, the function increments the count by the frequency of that pair. The function then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair (a % x, a % y).

Finally, the function appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the results list and returns it.

func_2 reads the input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to calculate the results. It then prints each result.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a frequency dictionary to efficiently count the pairs with the same remainder when divided by x and y, which reduces the time complexity of the algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
