Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair is considered beautiful if the sum of the two elements is divisible by x and the difference is divisible by y.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the remainder of each integer modulo x and y, and counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition. The function returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs in the corresponding test case that satisfy the condition.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads input from the console, parses it into a list of test cases, and calls `func_1` to process each test case. It then prints the results to the console.

The execution summaries of the functions indicate that they work together to solve the problem. `func_1` correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs in each test case, and `func_2` correctly reads input, calls `func_1`, and prints the results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
