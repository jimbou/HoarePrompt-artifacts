Output State: **`results` is a list of values returned by `func_1` for each tuple in `test_cases`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer, data is a list of strings, idx is an integer equal to 1 + 2 * t, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin**

In this output state, the value of `results` is a list of values returned by the function `func_1` for each tuple in `test_cases`. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, `data`, `idx`, and `input` remain unchanged.
