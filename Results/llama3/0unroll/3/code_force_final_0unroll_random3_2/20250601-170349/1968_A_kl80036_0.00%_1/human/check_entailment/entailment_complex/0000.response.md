Reasoning:

The problem statement asks to find an integer y (1 â‰¤ y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. The provided program divides each input integer x by 2 and prints the result as y.

The key observation here is that when x is even, x/2 is the largest possible y that satisfies the condition. This is because gcd(x, x/2) = x/2, and x/2 + x/2 = x, which is the maximum possible value.

When x is odd, x/2 is not an integer, but (x-1)/2 is the largest possible y that satisfies the condition. However, the program still prints x/2, which is the largest integer less than x/2.

In both cases, the program prints a y that satisfies the condition gcd(x, y) + y is maximum possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
