Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter. The program iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for tandem repeats of length j. If it finds a tandem repeat of length j, it prints the length of the repeat (which is 2*j) and returns.

The program correctly handles the case where there are no tandem repeats by printing 0. It also correctly handles the case where the input string contains only question marks, in which case it prints the length of the entire string.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains no question marks but does contain tandem repeats. In this case, the program will not find the tandem repeat and will incorrectly print 0.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
