Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates over the string from the middle to the start, checking for tandem repeats of length 2*j. It uses a sliding window approach, maintaining a count of the number of matching characters (including '?' characters) in the current window. If the count reaches j, it means a tandem repeat of length 2*j has been found, and the program prints the length and returns.

If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the program prints 0.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
