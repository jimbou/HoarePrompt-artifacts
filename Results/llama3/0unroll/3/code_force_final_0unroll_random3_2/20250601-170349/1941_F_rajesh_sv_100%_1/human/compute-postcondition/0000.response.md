Output State: **The value of `testcases` is returned by the function `func_3()`.**

In this output state, the value of `testcases` is no longer a non-negative integer, but rather the value returned by the function `func_3()`. The function `func_3()` is executed, and its return value is assigned to `testcases`. The initial state of `testcases` being a non-negative integer is no longer valid, as its value is now determined by the function `func_3()`.
