Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n non-decreasing integers, D is a sorted list of m unique integers, F is a list of k integers, max_diff is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, index is the index of the maximum difference in A, inf is a negative infinity value, left is the value of A at index - 1, right is the value of A at index, ans is the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, and `inf` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code only introduced new variables `left`, `right`, and `ans`, which were assigned values based on the existing variables. Specifically, `left` and `right` were assigned the values of `A` at indices `index - 1` and `index`, respectively, and `ans` was assigned the value of `max_diff`.
