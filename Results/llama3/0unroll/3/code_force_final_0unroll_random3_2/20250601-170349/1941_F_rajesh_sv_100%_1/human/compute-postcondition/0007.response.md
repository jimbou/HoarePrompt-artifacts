Output: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the minimum value of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A, considering all possible differences that can be obtained by subtracting a value from the list D and adding a value from the list F. The value of ans will be the minimum of its initial value and the minimum value obtained from the loop iterations. The values of n, m, k, A, D, F, max_diff, next_max_diff, index, inf, left, and right remain unchanged. The maximum value between the current value of ans and the next_max_diff is printed.**
