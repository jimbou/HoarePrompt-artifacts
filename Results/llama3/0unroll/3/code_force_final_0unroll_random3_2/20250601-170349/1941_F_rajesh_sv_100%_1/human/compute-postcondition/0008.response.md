Functionality: **This function calculates the minimum possible maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in a list A, considering all possible differences that can be obtained by subtracting a value from a sorted list D and adding a value from a list F. It returns the maximum value between the minimum possible maximum difference and the second maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A.**
