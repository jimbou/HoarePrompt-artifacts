This function memoizes the result of another function `func` by storing its results in a dictionary `d` for each unique tuple of arguments `args`. If `args` is not already in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)` and stores it in `d` before returning it. If `args` is already in `d`, it simply returns the previously computed result. The function returns the result of `func` for the given `args`, either by computing it and storing it in `d` or by retrieving it from `d` if it has been computed before.
