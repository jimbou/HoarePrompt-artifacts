Output: **the maximum value between the minimum value of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A and the next maximum difference (where the minimum value of the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in A is the minimum value obtained from the loop iterations and the next maximum difference is the maximum difference obtained from the loop iterations)**
