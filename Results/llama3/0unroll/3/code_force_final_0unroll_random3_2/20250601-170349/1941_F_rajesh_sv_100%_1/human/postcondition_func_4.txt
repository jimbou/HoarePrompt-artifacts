The function takes a delimiter string as input and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by splitting a string obtained from another function (func_2) using the provided delimiter, and then converting each resulting substring into an integer. The function does not modify the input delimiter string but uses it to process the string from func_2 into a list of integers.
