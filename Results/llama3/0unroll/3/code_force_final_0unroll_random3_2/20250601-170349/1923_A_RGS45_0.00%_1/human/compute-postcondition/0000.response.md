Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin consists of `t` test cases, each of which starts with an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. The values of `n` and the integers in the list are constrained as specified in the initial state.
