Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. 

Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index of the first '1' (representing a chip) from the left and the index of the first '1' from the right (by reversing the string). This effectively gives the range of cells that contain chips.

2. It then extracts the substring within this range (z = arr[x:n - y]).

3. Finally, it counts the number of '0's (representing free cells) within this substring and prints the result. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- If there are no free cells between the chips, the count of '0's will be 0, indicating that no operations are required.

- If there are free cells between the chips, the count of '0's will be greater than 0, indicating the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

- If there is only one chip, the count of '0's will be 0, indicating that no operations are required.

- If there are no chips, the program will not enter the loop, and no output will be printed, which is correct according to the problem description.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
