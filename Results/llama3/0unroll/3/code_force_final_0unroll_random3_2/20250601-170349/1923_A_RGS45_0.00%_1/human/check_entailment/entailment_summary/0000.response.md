Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.
3. It finds the index of the first '1' in the array `x` and the index of the last '1' in the array `y` (from the end).
4. It then extracts the subarray `z` from `x` to `n - y`, which represents the contiguous block of '1's.
5. Finally, it counts the number of '0's in the subarray `z` and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the contiguous block of '1's and counts the number of '0's within that block, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips.

Correctness: **True**
