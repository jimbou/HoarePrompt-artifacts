Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the minimum number of operations to move the chips in a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the input, processes it, and prints the output.

3. Inside the function, it first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

4. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the ribbon configuration as a string `arr`.

5. It then finds the index of the first '1' (representing a chip) from the left using `arr.find('1')` and assigns it to `x`.

6. It also finds the index of the first '1' from the right using `arr[::-1].find('1')` and assigns it to `y`.

7. The program then extracts the substring from `x` to `n - y` (exclusive) using `arr[x:n - y]` and assigns it to `z`.

8. Finally, it prints the count of '0's in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

9. The count of '0's in the substring `z` represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

10. The program does not handle any potential errors that might occur during input reading or processing.

11. The program assumes that the input will always be valid as described in the problem statement.

12. Based on the provided problem description and the given program, the program seems to correctly implement the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
