#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1).
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: Output State: The number of zeros in the longest contiguous subarray of ones in each test case, excluding leading and trailing zeros, will be printed to the console, and the value of `t` will remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the number of zeros in the longest contiguous subarray of ones in each test case, excluding leading and trailing zeros. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the results directly to the console. The input is expected to be in a specific format, with an integer t followed by t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. The function does not modify the input values, but only uses them to compute and print the desired output.
