This function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the number of zeros in the longest contiguous subarray of ones in each test case, excluding leading and trailing zeros. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the results directly to the console. The input is expected to be in a specific format, with an integer t followed by t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. The function does not modify the input values, but only uses them to compute and print the desired output.
