Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `arr`.

2. It finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in the array: The program uses the `find` method to find the index of the first '1' (`x`) and the last '1' (`y`) in the array. The `[::-1]` slice is used to reverse the array before finding the last '1'.

3. It extracts the subarray of interest: The program extracts the subarray `z` from `x` to `n - y`, which is the longest contiguous subarray of ones, excluding leading and trailing zeros.

4. It counts the number of zeros in the subarray: The program uses the `count` method to count the number of zeros in the subarray `z`.

5. It prints the result: The program prints the count of zeros in the subarray `z`, which is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
