#State of the program right berfore the function call: func is a function
    d = {}
    return wrapper
    #The program returns the wrapper function, which is a function that is not specified in the initial state, but is presumably defined elsewhere in the code.

#Overall this is what the function does:Returns a wrapper function that is presumably defined elsewhere in the code, without modifying the input dictionary d.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: args is a tuple of values of any type and d is a dictionary where keys are tuples of values of any type and values are the results of func(*args) for the corresponding key.
    if (args not in d) :
        d[args] = func(*args)
    #State: *args is a tuple of values of any type and d is a dictionary where keys are tuples of values of any type and values are the results of func(*args) for the corresponding key. If args is not in d, d[args] is the result of func(*args) for the current value of args. Otherwise, d remains unchanged.
    return d[args]
    #The program returns the result of func(*args) for the current value of args, which is stored in dictionary d with key args. If args is not in d, it returns the result of func(*args) for the current value of args, otherwise it returns the existing value in d for key args.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function memoizes the result of calling `func` with the provided `args` and returns the cached or newly computed result. It maintains a dictionary `d` to store the results of previous function calls, keyed by the input `args`. If the result for the given `args` is already in the dictionary, it returns the cached value; otherwise, it computes the result using `func(*args)`, stores it in the dictionary, and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be extracted from the given function signature as it does not contain any parameters.
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the first line of input from the standard input, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads the first line of input from the standard input, removes leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: func_2() returns a string that represents an integer.
    return int(func_2())
    #The program returns an integer that is represented by the string returned by func_2().

#Overall this is what the function does:Converts a string representation of an integer returned by func_2() to an integer and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: delimiter is a string
    return list(map(int, func_2().split(delimiter)))
    #The program returns a list of integers that are obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the delimiter string and then converting each split part to an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a delimiter string as input and returns a list of integers. It achieves this by splitting a string obtained from another function (`func_2`) using the provided delimiter, and then converting each resulting part into an integer. The function effectively transforms a string into a list of integers based on a specified delimiter.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No precondition can be determined as the function does not have any input parameters.
    return func_2()
    #The program returns the value returned by the function `func_2()`. No specific value can be determined as the function `func_2()` is not defined in the given code snippet.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calls another function named `func_2()` and returns its result, without performing any additional actions or modifications.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers, A is a list of n non-decreasing integers, D is a sorted list of m unique integers, F is a list of k integers, and inf is a negative infinity value.

    #State: The maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list A, index is the index of the maximum difference, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference, left is the element before the maximum difference, right is the element after the maximum difference, and ans is the minimum of the current ans and the maximum of the difference between D[l] + f and left, and the difference between right and D[l] + f.
    print(max(ans, next_max_diff))
    #This is printed: the maximum value between the minimum of the current ans and the maximum of the difference between D[l] + f and left, and the difference between right and D[l] + f, and the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list A

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a list A and then iterates through a list F to find the minimum difference between the maximum difference and the elements in a sorted list D. It returns the maximum value between the minimum difference found and the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in list A.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: testcases is a positive integer
    testcases = func_3()
    for _ in range(testcases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: The value of `testcases` is unknown because the function `func_3()` is not defined in the given initial state.

#Overall this is what the function does:Executes a loop a certain number of times, where the number of iterations is determined by the return value of `func_3()`, and calls `func_6()` in each iteration. The final state of the program is that `func_6()` has been called an unknown number of times, as the return value of `func_3()` is unknown.
