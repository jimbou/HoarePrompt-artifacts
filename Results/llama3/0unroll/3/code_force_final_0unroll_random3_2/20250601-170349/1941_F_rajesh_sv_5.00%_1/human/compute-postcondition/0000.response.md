Output State: **`testcases` is a value returned by `func_3()`, and its value is unknown because the function `func_3()` is not defined in the given initial state.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `testcases` is now the result of the function `func_3()`, but since we don't know what this function does or returns, we can't determine the exact value of `testcases`.
