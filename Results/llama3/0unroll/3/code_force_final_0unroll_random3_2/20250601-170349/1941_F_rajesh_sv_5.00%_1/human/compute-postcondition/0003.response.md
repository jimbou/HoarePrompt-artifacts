Output State: **max_diff is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list A, index is the index of the maximum difference, next_max_diff is the second maximum difference, left is the element before the maximum difference, right is the element after the maximum difference, and ans is the maximum difference.**

In this final state, the values of max_diff, index, and next_max_diff remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The variables left and right are assigned the values of the elements before and after the maximum difference in the list A, respectively. The variable ans is assigned the value of max_diff, which is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list A.
