This function memoizes the result of calling `func` with the provided `args` and returns the cached or newly computed result. It maintains a dictionary `d` to store the results of previous function calls, keyed by the input `args`. If the result for the given `args` is already in the dictionary, it returns the cached value; otherwise, it computes the result using `func(*args)`, stores it in the dictionary, and returns it.
