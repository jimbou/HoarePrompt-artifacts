Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input is "3 2 1". According to the problem description, this should output "NONE" because it does not form a stair or a peak. However, the program outputs "NONE" because it does not meet the condition for a stair or a peak, but it should output "NONE" because it does not meet the condition for a peak. 

The issue is with the condition `elif a < b > c:`. This condition is not correct because it is checking if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, but it is not checking if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c` and `a` is not equal to `c`. 

The correct condition should be `elif a < b and b > c:`. This condition checks if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, which is the correct condition for a peak.
