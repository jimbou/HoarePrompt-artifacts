This function reads a series of integer triplets from standard input, determines the relationship between the three integers in each triplet, and prints out a corresponding classification ('STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') for each triplet. The function does not modify the input values or return any values, but instead provides a printed output for each triplet based on its characteristics.
