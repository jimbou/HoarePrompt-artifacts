Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The key insight is that Alice should try to pick elements that will make the MEX of her array `c` as large as possible, while Bob should try to pick elements that will make the MEX of `c` as small as possible.

The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the input array `a`. It then iterates over the range `[0, N+1)` and checks if the count of each element is 1 or 0. If it finds an element with count 1, it increments a counter `t`. If it finds an element with count 0 or if `t` is greater than or equal to 2, it returns the current element as the MEX of `c`.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. If an element has count 1, it means that Alice can pick it and make the MEX of `c` larger. If an element has count 0, it means that Bob can pick it and make the MEX of `c` smaller. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2, it means that Alice has already picked two elements with count 1, and Bob can pick any element to make the MEX of `c` smaller.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases where `N` is 1 or 2, and where the input array `a` contains only one or two distinct elements.

Overall, the program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob, and it correctly handles all possible edge cases.
