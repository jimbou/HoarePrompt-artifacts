Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary where the key is the integer from the list `a` and the value is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`, `t` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` remains unchanged as it was before the code execution. The code only introduces a new variable `t` and assigns it the value 0. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged `cnt` dictionary and the newly introduced `t` variable with the value 0.
