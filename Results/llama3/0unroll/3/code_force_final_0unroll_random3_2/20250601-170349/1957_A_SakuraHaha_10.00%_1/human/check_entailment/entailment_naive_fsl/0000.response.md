Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that it only considers the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with 4 sides (quadrilaterals), but it does not consider polygons with more or fewer sides.

For example, if the input is:

3
1 1 1

The program will output 0, but the correct answer is 1, because we can form an equilateral triangle with the three sticks.

The program should be modified to consider all possible polygon sides, not just quadrilaterals.
