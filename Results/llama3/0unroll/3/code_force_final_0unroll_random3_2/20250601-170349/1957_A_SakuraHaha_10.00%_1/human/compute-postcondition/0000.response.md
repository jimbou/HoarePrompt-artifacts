Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer and 1 <= n <= 100. a is a list of n positive integers and 1 <= a_i <= 100. ans is 0. cnt is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases because one test case has been processed by the code. The first line of each test case still contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` space-separated integers. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. The list `a` contains `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 100, inclusive. The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and the dictionary `cnt` is empty.
