Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary called residue_map to store the residues of the numbers in the array modulo x and y. For each number in the array, it calculates the residue modulo x and y, and then checks if the corresponding residue pair is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs by the number of times this residue pair has been seen before.

The program then updates the dictionary with the current number's residue pair and increments its count.

The program repeats this process for all numbers in the array and finally returns the total count of beautiful pairs.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
