Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the problem description. The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to store the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions for each residue pair `(r_x, r_y)`. It iterates through the array, calculates the residue pair for each number, and increments the count of beautiful pairs by the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions for the complementary residue pair.

The program correctly handles the case where `x` or `y` is 1, as the residue pair `(r_x, r_y)` will be `(0, num % y)` or `(num % x, 0)` respectively, which is correctly handled by the program.

The program also correctly handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal, as the residue pair `(r_x, r_y)` will be `(num % x, num % x)`, which is correctly handled by the program.

The program has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, as it iterates through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, the `residue_map` can store n pairs.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the problem description, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
