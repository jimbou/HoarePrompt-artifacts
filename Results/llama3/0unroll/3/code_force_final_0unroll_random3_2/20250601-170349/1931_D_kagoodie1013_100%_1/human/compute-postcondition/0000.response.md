Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases. Each test case is a list of two elements. The first element is a list of three integers n, x, and y (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9). The second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is that we still have the same list of test cases with their respective constraints, and we have introduced a new empty list called `results`.
