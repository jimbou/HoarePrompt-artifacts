Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a dictionary (residue_map) to store the count of numbers in the array that have the same residue modulo x and y. It then iterates through the array, calculating the residue of each number modulo x and y, and increments the count in the dictionary accordingly.

The key insight here is that if a_i + a_j is divisible by x, then a_i % x == -a_j % x (or equivalently, a_i % x == (x - a_j % x) % x). Similarly, if a_i - a_j is divisible by y, then a_i % y == a_j % y.

The program uses this insight to count the number of beautiful pairs by iterating through the array and checking if the residue of each number modulo x and y matches the residue of any other number in the array.

However, there is a mistake in the program. The line `r_x = -num % x` should be `r_x = (x - num % x) % x` to correctly calculate the residue of num modulo x.

Correctness: **False**
