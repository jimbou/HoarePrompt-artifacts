#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases. Each test case is a list of two elements. The first element is a list of three integers n, x, and y (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9). The second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the count of pairs of numbers in each test case that satisfy the condition `a_i % x == a_j % x` and `a_i % y != a_j % y`, where `a_i` and `a_j` are elements of the array `arr`. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns the list 'results' which contains the count of pairs of numbers in each test case that satisfy the condition `a_i % x == a_j % x` and `a_i % y != a_j % y`, where `a_i` and `a_j` are elements of the array `arr`. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of integers and an array of numbers. It processes each test case by counting the pairs of numbers in the array that satisfy the condition `a_i % x == a_j % x` and `a_i % y != a_j % y`, and returns a list of these counts. The input list of test cases remains unchanged.
