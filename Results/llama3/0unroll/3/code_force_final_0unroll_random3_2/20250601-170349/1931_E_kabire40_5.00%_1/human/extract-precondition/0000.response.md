Precondition: **stdin contains a sequence of lines, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), and each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6), followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
