Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a sequence of lines, where each line contains either 'Sasha' or 'Anna'. The number of lines is equal to the value of t in the initial state. Each line corresponds to the result of the loop's execution for the respective input values of n, m, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**
