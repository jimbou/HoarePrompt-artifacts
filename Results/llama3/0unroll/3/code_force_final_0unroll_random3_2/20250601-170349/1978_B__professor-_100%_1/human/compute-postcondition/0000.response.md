The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the first line of the input, and the stdin now contains the remaining lines of input (t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each containing three integers n, a, and b.**
