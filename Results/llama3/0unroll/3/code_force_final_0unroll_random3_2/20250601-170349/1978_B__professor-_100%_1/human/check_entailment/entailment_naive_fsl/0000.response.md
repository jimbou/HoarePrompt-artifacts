Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. 

Here's why:

1. If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it's optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The program correctly calculates the maximum profit as `n * a` in this case.

2. If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it's optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The program correctly calculates the maximum profit using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program calculates the maximum profit by selling `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. The profit from the modified price buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`, and the profit from the usual price buns is `a * n`. The program correctly adds these two profits together.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, and the examples provided in the problem description match the output of the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
