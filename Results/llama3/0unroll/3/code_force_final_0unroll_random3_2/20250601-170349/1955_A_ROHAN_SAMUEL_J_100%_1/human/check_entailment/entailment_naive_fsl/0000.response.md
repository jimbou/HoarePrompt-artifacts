Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: when n is odd and when n is even. 

When n is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it buys (n - 1) / 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (b) and one yogurt at the regular price (a).

When n is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying two yogurts at the promotion price (b). If it is, it buys all yogurts at the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it buys n / 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (b).

The program correctly handles all possible cases and calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".
