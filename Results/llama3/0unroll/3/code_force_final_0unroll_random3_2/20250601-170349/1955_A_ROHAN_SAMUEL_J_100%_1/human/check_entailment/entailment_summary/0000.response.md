Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum cost for buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka" based on the provided problem description. The program iterates through each test case, and for each case, it determines the minimum cost by considering the conditions specified in the problem.

The program first checks if the number of yogurts (n) is odd. If it is, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it calculates the total cost by buying n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b) and adding the cost of one yogurt at the regular price (a).

If the number of yogurts is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, the program calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the regular price (a * n). Otherwise, it calculates the total cost by buying n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b).

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, and it correctly handles all possible scenarios. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
