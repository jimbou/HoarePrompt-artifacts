Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to calculate the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles. The program iterates through each test case, and for each case, it determines the minimum cost based on the values of n, a, and b.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is odd or even, and it considers the conditions where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is more advantageous than buying them at the regular price.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case. The output state matches the expected output format, with each line containing a single integer representing the minimum cost for the corresponding input line.

Correctness: **True**
