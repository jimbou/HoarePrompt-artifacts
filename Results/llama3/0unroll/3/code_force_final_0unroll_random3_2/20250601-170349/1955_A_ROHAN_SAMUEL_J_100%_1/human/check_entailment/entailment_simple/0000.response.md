Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program iterates over the input test cases, and for each case, it calculates the minimum cost based on the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

The program correctly handles the different scenarios:

1.  If n is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If so, it calculates the total cost as a * n. Otherwise, it calculates the cost as n // 2 * b + a, which accounts for buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
2.  If n is even, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If so, it calculates the total cost as a * n. Otherwise, it calculates the cost as n // 2 * b, which accounts for buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible scenarios based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
