Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes into account the promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.

2. For each test case, it reads three integers: n (the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy), a (the price for one yogurt), and b (the price for two yogurts on promotion).

3. The program then checks if the number of yogurts (n) is odd. If it is, it checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the price of one yogurt (a * n). Otherwise, it calculates the total cost by buying n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b) and adding the cost of one yogurt at the regular price (a).

4. If the number of yogurts (n) is even, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (2 * a) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (b). If it is, it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of yogurts by the price of one yogurt (a * n). Otherwise, it calculates the total cost by buying n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (n // 2 * b).

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
