Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem, where the goal is to assign distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. A clique is a set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques required to partition the graph, initializes two lists `arr` and `cliquess` to store the clique numbers for each vertex, and then calls the `make_array` function to populate these lists.

The `make_array` function takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It calculates the midpoint of the range defined by `left` and `right`, and then populates the `arr` and `cliquess` lists with consecutive integers starting from `small_element` (left + 1) up to `big_element` (right + 1), divided into two segments at the midpoint. The `clique` value is assigned to the corresponding elements in the `cliquess` list.

The program then prints the populated `arr` list, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` list.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the graph partitioning problem. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of cliques and initializes the lists, while the `make_array` function correctly populates the lists with the required values.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
