Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2)**

The code snippet calculates and assigns values to four new variables: small_element, big_element, mid, and not_mid. The values of these variables are determined based on the initial values of left and right. The small_element is assigned the value of left + 1, and the big_element is assigned the value of right + 1. The mid variable is calculated as the integer division of the difference between big_element and small_element by 2, which is equivalent to (right - left + 1) // 2. The not_mid variable is calculated as the difference between the total range (right - left + 1) and the mid value. The values of left, right, clique, arr, and cliquess remain unchanged.
