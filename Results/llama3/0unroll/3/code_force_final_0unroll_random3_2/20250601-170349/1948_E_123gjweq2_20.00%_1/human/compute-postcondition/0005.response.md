Functionality: **Populates a portion of two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, with specific values. It takes a range defined by `left` and `right`, and a `clique` value as input. The function sets consecutive integers in `arr` starting from `small_element` (left + 1) up to `big_element` (right + 1), divided into two segments at the midpoint, and assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`. The function modifies the input lists in place, without returning any value.**
