Based on the precondition, the `cliquess` list contains n integers, where each integer represents the number of the clique it belongs to. The `print(*cliquess)` statement will print the elements of the `cliquess` list.

Since the exact values of the integers in the `cliquess` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the clique numbers for each element in the list.

Output: **[clique numbers for each element in the list cliquess]**
