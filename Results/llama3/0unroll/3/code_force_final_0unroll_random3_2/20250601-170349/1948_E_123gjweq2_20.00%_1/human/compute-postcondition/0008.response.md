Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It divides the range of n into cliques of size k, assigns each element in the range to a clique, and prints the clique number for each element. The function also prints the total number of cliques and the clique numbers for each element in a separate list. The output provides a mapping of each element in the range to its corresponding clique number, effectively partitioning the range into cliques of size k.**
