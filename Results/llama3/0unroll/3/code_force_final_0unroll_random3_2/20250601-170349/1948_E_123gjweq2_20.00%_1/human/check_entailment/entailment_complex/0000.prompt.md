Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, cliques is a positive integer, arr is a list of n integers where each integer is equal to the number of the clique it belongs to, cliquess is a list of n integers where each integer is equal to the number of the clique it belongs to.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: [clique number 1], [clique number 2], ..., [clique number n] (where each clique number is an integer representing the clique that the corresponding element in the list belongs to)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: the number of cliques
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: [clique numbers for each element in the list cliquess]

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It divides the range of n into cliques of size k, assigns each element in the range to a clique, and prints the clique number for each element. The function also prints the total number of cliques and the clique numbers for each element in a separate list. The output provides a mapping of each element in the range to its corresponding clique number, effectively partitioning the range into cliques of size k.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a positive integer, arr and cliquess are lists of length at least right + 1.
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The elements of arr from index left to left + mid - 1 are populated with consecutive integers starting from small_element, and the corresponding elements in cliquess are set to clique.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The elements of arr from index left + mid to left + mid + not_mid - 1 are populated with consecutive integers starting from big_element - not_mid + 1 and ending at big_element, and the corresponding elements in cliquess are set to clique.

#Overall this is what the function does:Populates a portion of two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, with specific values. It takes a range defined by `left` and `right`, and a `clique` value as input. The function sets consecutive integers in `arr` starting from `small_element` (left + 1) up to `big_element` (right + 1), divided into two segments at the midpoint, and assigns the `clique` value to the corresponding elements in `cliquess`. The function modifies the input lists in place, without returning any value.
