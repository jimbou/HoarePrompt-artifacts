Output State: **The output state is a sequence of numbers where each number is either 1 more or 1 less than the previous number, starting from 1 and ending at n. The sequence alternates between incrementing and decrementing by 1, with the first number being 1. For example, if n = 5, the output would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If n = 6, the output would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.**
