This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then maps each integer to a corresponding character in the alphabet (0 -> 'a', 1 -> 'b', ..., 25 -> 'z') and prints the resulting string for each test case. The function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty.
