Output State: **`a` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).**

In natural language, the output state is that a new variable `a` is created and assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The state of the standard input (stdin) remains unchanged, still containing multiple test cases, each with two lines: the first line with a single integer n, and the second line with n integers.
