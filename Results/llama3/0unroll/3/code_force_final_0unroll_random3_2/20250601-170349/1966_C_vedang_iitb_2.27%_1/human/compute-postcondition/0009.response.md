Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `a`, the length of `a` is more than 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The length of `a` is still more than 1, and `n` is still not equal to 2, as these conditions are not affected by the code. The new variable `winNext` is introduced, which is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2` when called with the arguments `a[1:]` (the list `a` without its first element) and `n - 1`.
