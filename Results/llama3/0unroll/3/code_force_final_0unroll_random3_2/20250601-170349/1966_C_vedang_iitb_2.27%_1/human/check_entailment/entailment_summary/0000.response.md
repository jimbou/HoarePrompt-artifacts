Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly removes duplicates from the input list, sorts it, and calculates the differences between consecutive elements. This is a crucial step in the game, as it allows us to focus on the differences between the pile sizes, which determines the possible moves.

Function 2 (`func_2`) is a recursive function that determines the winning move for the game. It correctly handles the base cases (when there is only one or two piles) and the recursive case. The function returns 1 if the current player can win and 2 otherwise.

The main program correctly reads the input, calls `func_1` to process the input list, and then calls `func_2` to determine the winner. The output is printed accordingly.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the game's rules. The use of recursion in `func_2` is appropriate, as it allows us to elegantly handle the game's recursive nature.

Overall, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.
