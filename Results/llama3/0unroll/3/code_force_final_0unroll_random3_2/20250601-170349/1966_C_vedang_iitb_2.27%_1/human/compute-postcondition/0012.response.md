Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of positive integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `a`, the length of `a` is more than 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` is the value returned by `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`, and either `winNext` is not equal to 2 or (`winNext` is equal to 1 and `a[0]` is equal to 1).***
