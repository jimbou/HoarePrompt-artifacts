#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers.

    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):

    #State: Output State: a_new is a list of non-negative integers where each element is the difference between the corresponding element in a_new and the previous element in a_new, a is a list of positive integers, a_temp is a sorted list of unique positive integers from a.
    return a_new
    #The program returns a list of non-negative integers where each element is the difference between the corresponding element in a_new and the previous element in a_new, which are derived from a sorted list of unique positive integers from list a.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements. The function returns a new list containing these differences, which are non-negative integers. The original input list remains unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers and n is a positive integer equal to the length of a.
    if (n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1, which is equal to the length of the list 'a' that contains positive integers.
    else :
        if (n == 2) :
            if (a[0] % 2 == 0) :
                return 1
                #The program returns the number 1
            else :
                return 2
                #The program returns the number 2.
        else :
            winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
            if (winNext == 2 or winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1) :
                return 1
                #The program returns the integer 1
            else :
                return 2
                #The program returns 2

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winning move for a game based on a list of positive integers and its length. Returns 1 if the current player can win, and 2 otherwise.
