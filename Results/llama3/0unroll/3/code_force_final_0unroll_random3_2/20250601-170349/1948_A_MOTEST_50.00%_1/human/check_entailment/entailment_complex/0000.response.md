Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program takes the number of test cases and the number of special characters for each test case as input, and then constructs a string by repeating uppercase ASCII letters in a specific pattern.

The program correctly handles the case where n is 1 by printing 'NO', as it is impossible to construct a string with exactly one special character. For n greater than 1, the program constructs a string by repeating uppercase ASCII letters in a pattern that ensures exactly n special characters.

The program's logic for constructing the string is correct. When n is even, it repeats each letter twice, resulting in n/2 pairs of special characters. When n is odd, it starts with 'AAA' (which has 2 special characters) and then repeats each letter twice, resulting in (n-1)/2 pairs of special characters, plus the initial 2 special characters.

The program's output format is also correct, printing 'YES' followed by the constructed string for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
