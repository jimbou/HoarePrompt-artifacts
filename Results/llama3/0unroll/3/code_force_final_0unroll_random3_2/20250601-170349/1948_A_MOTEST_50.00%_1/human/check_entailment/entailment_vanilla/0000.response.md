Reasoning:

1. The program first clears the screen using `os.system('cls')`, which is not necessary for the problem but does not affect the correctness of the program.

2. It then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the number of special characters `n`.

4. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have a string with only one special character.

5. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `ans` by repeating each uppercase letter twice. The number of special characters in this string is `n`, so it prints 'YES' and the string `ans`.

6. If `n` is odd, it constructs a string `ans` by starting with 'AAA' (which has 2 special characters) and then repeating each uppercase letter twice. The number of special characters in this string is `n`, so it prints 'YES' and the string `ans`.

7. The program handles all possible cases correctly and produces the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
