Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem description. It checks if the input number `n` is 1, in which case it prints "NO" because there is no suitable string with exactly one special character. For all other cases, it constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating uppercase Latin letters.

The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly. When `n` is even, it constructs a string by repeating each letter twice, resulting in `n/2` pairs of identical letters. When `n` is odd, it starts with the string "AAA" (which has 3 special characters) and then adds `n/2 - 1` pairs of identical letters.

The program also handles the case where `n` is greater than the number of uppercase Latin letters (26). In this case, it will still produce a correct string by repeating the letters.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
