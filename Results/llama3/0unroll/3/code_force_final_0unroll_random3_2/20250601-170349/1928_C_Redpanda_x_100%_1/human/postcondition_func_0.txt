This function takes a positive integer n as input and returns a generator that yields all the prime factors of n. The function first calculates the prime factors of n and their respective powers, then iterates over these prime factors, yielding each one. The function does not modify the input variable n. After the function concludes, the state of the program is unchanged except for the generator, which has been exhausted.
