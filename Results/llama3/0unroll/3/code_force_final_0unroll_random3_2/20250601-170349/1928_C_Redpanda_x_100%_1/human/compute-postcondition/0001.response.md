The code `yield 1` generates a value of 1 and suspends the execution of the function, allowing the caller to receive the value. This means that the function will return a value of 1, but the state of the variables k, primes, and factors will not be changed.

Output State: **k is a non-negative integer, primes is a list of prime numbers, factors is a dictionary where the keys are prime numbers and the values are their corresponding powers, and the function returns a value of 1.**
