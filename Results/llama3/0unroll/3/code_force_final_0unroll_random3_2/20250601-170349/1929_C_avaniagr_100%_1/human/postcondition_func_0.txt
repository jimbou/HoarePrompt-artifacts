This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers: k, x, and a. It then determines whether the value of 'a' is greater than or equal to a calculated value 'z' based on the values of 'k' and 'x'. The function prints 'YES' to the console if 'a' is greater than or equal to 'z', and 'NO' otherwise, for each test case.
