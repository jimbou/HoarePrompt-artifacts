Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  The program first checks if `x` is less than `k - 1`. In this case, Sasha can guarantee a win by betting `1` coin if he has not lost before or if he has won the previous bet, and betting `2` coins if he has lost the previous bet. If Sasha has at least `x + 1` coins initially, he can guarantee a win. Otherwise, he cannot.
2.  If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins initially to guarantee a win. This is because he needs to have enough coins to bet `2` coins after losing `x` times in a row.
3.  If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, the program calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee a win. This is done by simulating the betting process, where Sasha bets the minimum number of coins required to win after losing `x` times in a row. The program calculates the minimum number of coins required by iteratively adding the minimum number of coins needed to win after losing `x` times in a row.
4.  Finally, the program checks if Sasha has at least the calculated minimum number of coins initially. If he does, the program prints "YES", indicating that Sasha can guarantee a win. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Correctness: **True**
