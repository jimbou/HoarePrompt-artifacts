Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the strategy to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins by placing bets at the casino. The program considers different cases based on the values of x and k, and for each case, it checks whether Sasha has enough initial coins to guarantee winning.

The program correctly handles the cases where x < k - 1, x == k - 1, and x > k - 1. For x < k - 1, it checks if Sasha has at least x + 1 coins. For x == k - 1, it checks if Sasha has at least x + 2 coins. For x > k - 1, it calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee winning and checks if he has at least that many coins.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having at least n coins. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases, and the correctness is **True**.
