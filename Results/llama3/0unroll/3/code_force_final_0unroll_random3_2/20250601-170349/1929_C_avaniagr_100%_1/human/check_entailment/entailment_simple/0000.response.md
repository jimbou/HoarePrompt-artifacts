Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants based on the given conditions.

The program first checks if x is less than k-1. If this is the case, Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants if he has at least x+1 coins initially. This is because he can place a bet of 1 coin, and if he wins, he will have k coins. If he loses, he will have x coins left, and he can place another bet of 1 coin. Since x < k-1, he can repeat this process until he wins, and he will always have at least x+1 coins.

If x is equal to k-1, Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants if he has at least x+2 coins initially. This is because he can place a bet of 1 coin, and if he wins, he will have k coins. If he loses, he will have x coins left, and he can place another bet of 1 coin. Since x = k-1, he can repeat this process until he wins, and he will always have at least x+2 coins.

If x is greater than k-1, the program calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to have initially to guarantee having as many coins as he wants. This is done by calculating the sum of the geometric series with first term k-2 and common ratio 1/(k-1), up to x-k+3 terms. If Sasha has at least this many coins initially, he can place bets in such a way that he will always have at least this many coins, regardless of the outcome of the bets.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants based on the given conditions, and it prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
