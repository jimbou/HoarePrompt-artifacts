Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
2 4 1

The program will output:

999999999 999999999 999999999

However, this output does not satisfy the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Specifically, 4 ≠ 999999999 mod 999999999.

The issue with the program is that it simply subtracts the current element from the previous element to calculate the next element in the sequence. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will satisfy the given condition.

A correct approach would be to find a sequence that satisfies the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. One possible solution is to start with a_1 = x_2 and then calculate a_i = x_i + a_{i-1} for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. This ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

For example, for the input:

3
2 4 1

A correct output would be:

3 5 4

This output satisfies the condition x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
