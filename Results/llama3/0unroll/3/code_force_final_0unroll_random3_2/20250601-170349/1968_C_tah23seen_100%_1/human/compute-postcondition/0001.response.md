Output State: **ans is a list of n elements where ans[i] = sum(arr[i:]) for all i in range(n), i is -1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `ans` now contains the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `arr` from the end to the beginning, and the variable `i` has reached -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
