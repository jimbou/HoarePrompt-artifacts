#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and n is an integer such that n = len(arr) + 1 and 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x <= 500 for all x in arr.
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: ans is a list of n elements where ans[i] = sum(arr[i:]) for all i in range(n), i is -1.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' that contains the cumulative sum of the elements in the list 'arr' from each index to the end, where 'ans' has 'n' elements and 'n' is the number of elements in 'arr'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the cumulative sum of elements in a given list 'arr' from each index to the end and returns a new list 'ans' containing these cumulative sums. The returned list 'ans' has the same number of elements as 'arr' plus one. The function takes a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'n' as input, where 'n' is equal to the length of 'arr' plus one. The function does not modify the original list 'arr'.
