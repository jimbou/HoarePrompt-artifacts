Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a greedy approach. The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to `10**9`. Then, it iterates from the second last element to the first element of the input array `arr`. For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the value of `ans[i]` as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. This is based on the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}`, which can be rewritten as `a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i`.

However, this approach is incorrect. The condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` does not imply that `a_i = a_{i-1} - x_i`. The correct implication is that `a_i` can be any number that is congruent to `x_i` modulo `a_{i-1}`, i.e., `a_i = a_{i-1} * k + x_i` for some integer `k`.

Moreover, the program does not ensure that the calculated values of `ans[i]` are within the range `[1, 10**9]`, which is a requirement of the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
