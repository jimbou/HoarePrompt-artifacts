This function calculates the cumulative sum of elements in a given list 'arr' from each index to the end and returns a new list 'ans' containing these cumulative sums. The returned list 'ans' has the same number of elements as 'arr' plus one. The function takes a list of integers 'arr' and an integer 'n' as input, where 'n' is equal to the length of 'arr' plus one. The function does not modify the original list 'arr'.
