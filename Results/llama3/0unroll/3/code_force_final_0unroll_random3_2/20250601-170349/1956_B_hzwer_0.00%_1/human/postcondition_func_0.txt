This function determines the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from a given set of cards, where each card has a value between 1 and n (inclusive), and each value appears at most twice. It takes no explicit parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting multiple test cases with two inputs per case: an integer n and a space-separated list of n integers representing the card values. The function returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed using the given cards, considering all possible combinations and adhering to the condition that each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence.
