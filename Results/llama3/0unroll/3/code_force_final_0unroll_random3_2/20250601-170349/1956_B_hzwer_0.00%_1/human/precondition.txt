stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a space-separated list of n integers (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n). The integer n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n are positive integers (1 <= a_i <= n) and each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
