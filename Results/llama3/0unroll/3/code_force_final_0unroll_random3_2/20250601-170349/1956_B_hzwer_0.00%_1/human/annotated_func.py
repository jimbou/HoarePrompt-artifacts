#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: dp is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of pairs that can be formed using the first i cards and j pairs, with all elements calculated based on the given conditions.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed using 0 cards and 0 pairs.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from a given set of cards, where each card has a value between 1 and n (inclusive), and each value appears at most twice. It takes no explicit parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting multiple test cases with two inputs per case: an integer n and a space-separated list of n integers representing the card values. The function returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed using the given cards, considering all possible combinations and adhering to the condition that each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the sequence.
