Precondition: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), the second line contains a character (one of "CDHS"), and the third line contains a space-separated list of 2n two-character strings, where each string represents a card with a rank (one of "23456789") and a suit (one of "CDHS"). All cards are different.**
