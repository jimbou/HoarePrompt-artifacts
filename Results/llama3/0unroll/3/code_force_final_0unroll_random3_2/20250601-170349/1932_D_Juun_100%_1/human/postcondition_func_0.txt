This function processes a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a trump suit and a set of cards. It attempts to pair up cards of the same suit, using trump cards to complete pairs when necessary. If it is impossible to pair up all cards, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. Otherwise, it prints out the paired cards, with trump cards paired together and non-trump cards paired in sorted order.
