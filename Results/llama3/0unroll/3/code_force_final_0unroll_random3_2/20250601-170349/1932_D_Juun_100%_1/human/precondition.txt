stdin contains one or more test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line is an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), the second line is a single character, the trump suit, which is one of "CDHS", and the third line is a space-separated list of 2n two-character strings, each representing a card, with the first character being the rank of the card, one of "23456789", and the second character being the suit of the card, one of "CDHS". All cards are different.
