You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), the second line contains a character (one of "CDHS"), and the third line contains a space-separated list of 2n two-character strings, where each string represents a card with a rank (one of "23456789") and a suit (one of "CDHS"). All cards are different.
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: stdin contains t-2 test cases, trump is a character (one of "CDHS"), trumps is a list of ranks of cards that are of the trump suit, answers is a list of strings, each string is a space-separated list of two cards of the same suit, sorted by rank, suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values are either None or a rank of a card.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The answers list has been updated with new strings, each representing a pair of cards of the same suit, sorted by rank. The trumps list has been modified, with some elements removed. The suits dictionary remains unchanged, with the same keys and values as before. The stdin, trump, and t variables remain unchanged.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The trumps list is empty, and the answers list, suits dictionary, stdin, trump, and t variables remain unchanged.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The trumps list is empty, and the answers list, suits dictionary, stdin, trump, and t variables remain unchanged.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
