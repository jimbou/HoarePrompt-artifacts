Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where there are two cards of the same suit that are not trump cards, and there are no trump cards left to beat them. In this case, the program will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' even if it is possible to reconstruct the rounds played in the game.

For example, if the input is:

3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

The program will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' because it tries to use a trump card to beat the 3C, but there are no trump cards left. However, it is possible to reconstruct the rounds played in the game by having the first player play the 3C and the second player play the 4C.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle the case where there are two cards of the same suit that are not trump cards, and there are no trump cards left to beat them. One possible solution is to add a check to see if there are any cards of the same suit that can be played together, and if so, add them to the answers list.
