Output State: The loop has iterated over the suits dictionary, and for each suit with a non-None rank, it has appended a string to the answers list in the format '{rank}{suit} {trump_rank}{trump}' where trump_rank is the last element of the trumps list. If the trumps list was not empty, it has also removed the last element from the trumps list. If the trumps list was empty, it has printed 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returned from the function. The stdin, trump, and suits variables remain unchanged.
