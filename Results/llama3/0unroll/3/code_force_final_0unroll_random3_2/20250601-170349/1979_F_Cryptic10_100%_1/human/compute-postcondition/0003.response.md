Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5). For each test case, it generates a sequence of integers representing the final order of elements in the set vx after performing a series of operations. The operations involve removing elements from the set vx and appending them to lists p1 and p2 in a specific order. The final order of the elements is the reverse of the order in which they were appended to p1 and p2. The function then prints the final order of elements for each test case to standard output, with each sequence starting with '! ' followed by a sequence of space-separated integers.**
