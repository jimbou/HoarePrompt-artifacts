Output State: **`q` is a function that prints '? %d' % d and returns a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5).**

In this output state, the function `q` is defined as a lambda function that takes an argument `d`. When called, it prints the string '? %d' % d, where `d` is the argument passed to the function, and then returns a list of integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` within the range 2 to 10^5.
