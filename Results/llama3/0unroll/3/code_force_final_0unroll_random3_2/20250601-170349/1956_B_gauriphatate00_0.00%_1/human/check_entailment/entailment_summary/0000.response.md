Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game by taking turns optimally. The game involves two players, each with n cards, and the objective is to maximize the score by selecting cards that will result in points.

Function 1 (func_1) calculates the minimum value between the number of elements in list 'a' that appear exactly twice and half of the positive integer 'n'. This function is used to determine the maximum number of points a player can score.

Function 2 (func_2) reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by a list of n integers between 1 and n (inclusive), with each integer appearing at most twice in the list. The function calls func_1 for each test case and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list.

Based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that func_1 correctly calculates the maximum number of points a player can score, and func_2 correctly reads input, processes it, and prints the results. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
