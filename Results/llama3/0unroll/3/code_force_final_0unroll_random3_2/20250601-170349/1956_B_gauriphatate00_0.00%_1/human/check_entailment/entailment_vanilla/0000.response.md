Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game, given the cards in their hand and the optimal strategy of their opponent.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a` as input. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each card in the hand. Then, it calculates the number of pairs of cards with the same value by summing up the counts that are equal to 2. Finally, it returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2`, which represents the maximum number of points the player can score.

Function 2, `func_2`, reads the input data from the standard input, processes each test case, and prints the results. It uses the `func_1` function to calculate the maximum number of points for each test case.

The reasoning behind the correctness of the program is as follows:

* The `Counter` class correctly counts the frequency of each card in the hand.
* The calculation of the number of pairs of cards with the same value is correct.
* The minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` correctly represents the maximum number of points the player can score, since the player can only score points for pairs of cards with the same value, and the opponent's optimal strategy will try to minimize the player's score.
* The `func_2` function correctly reads the input data and processes each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
