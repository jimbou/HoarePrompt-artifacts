This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to be a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer n followed by a list of n integers between 1 and n (inclusive), with each integer appearing at most twice in the list. The function calls another function, func_1, for each test case and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list.
