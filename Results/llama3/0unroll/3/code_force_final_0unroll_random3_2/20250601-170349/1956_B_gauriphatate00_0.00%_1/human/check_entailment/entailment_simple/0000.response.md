Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The problem statement asks for the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally. The program correctly calculates this by counting the number of pairs of cards with the same integer (i.e., `pairs`) and returning the minimum of this count and half of the total number of cards (`n // 2`). This is because you can only score points by playing a card that has a pair on the table, and you can only play at most half of the total number of cards.

2. The program correctly handles the input and output. It reads the input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into individual data points, and processes each test case separately. It then appends the result of each test case to the `results` list and prints each result at the end.

3. The program correctly handles the edge cases. For example, if `n` is 1, the program correctly returns 0, because you cannot score any points with only one card. Similarly, if `n` is an even number, the program correctly returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`, because you can only play at most half of the total number of cards.

4. The program is efficient. It uses a `Counter` object to count the number of pairs of cards with the same integer, which has a time complexity of O(n). It then uses a simple loop to process each test case, which has a time complexity of O(t), where t is the number of test cases. Overall, the program has a time complexity of O(t \* n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
