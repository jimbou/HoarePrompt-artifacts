Reasoning: 

The problem description requires us to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by playing optimally, given the cards in our hand. The provided functions seem to be implementing a solution to this problem.

Function 1 calculates the minimum value between the number of elements in the list 'a' that appear exactly twice and half of the positive integer 'n'. This is a key insight into the problem, as it recognizes that we can only score points by playing cards that have a pair in our hand, and that we can only play at most half of the total cards.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It calls Function 1 for each test case and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the functions are correctly implementing the solution to the problem. The functions are correctly calculating the maximum number of points that can be scored by playing optimally, given the cards in our hand.

Correctness: **True**
