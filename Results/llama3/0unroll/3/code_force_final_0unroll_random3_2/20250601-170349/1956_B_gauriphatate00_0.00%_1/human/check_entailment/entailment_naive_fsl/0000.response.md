Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The function `func_1` takes the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a` as input, and returns the minimum of the number of pairs of cards with the same integer and `n // 2`. This is because the player can score a point for each pair of cards with the same integer, but only if the total number of pairs does not exceed `n // 2`.

The function `func_2` reads the input from the standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result. It uses the `func_1` function to calculate the maximum number of points that can be scored for each test case.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles the cases where the number of pairs of cards with the same integer is less than or equal to `n // 2`, and where the number of pairs is greater than `n // 2`. It also correctly handles the cases where the input is valid and where the input is invalid (e.g., when the number of cards is not a positive integer).

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
