Output State: **The values of arr from index start_index to start_index + i - 1 have been updated to i - 1.**

In this output state, the function `make_stairs` is called with the argument `i - 1`, which means the function will update the values of `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` to `i - 1`. The values of `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` were previously updated to `i`, but now the values from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` have been updated to `i - 1`.
