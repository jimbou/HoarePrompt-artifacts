Postcondition: ***`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i-1]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` and the current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`. Otherwise, the values of `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` have been updated to `i - 1`.***
