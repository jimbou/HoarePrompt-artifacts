Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation. The operation involves choosing two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, computing `x` as the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the set `{a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r}`, and simultaneously setting `a_l := x, a_{l+1} := x, ..., a_r := x`.

The program uses a recursive approach with memoization to find the maximum sum of elements in the array. The `func_1` function calculates the maximum sum for a given subarray, and the `func_2` function constructs the sequence of operations to achieve this maximum sum.

The program correctly handles the base cases, such as when the length of the subarray is 1 or when the maximum sum is achieved by setting all elements in the subarray to the same value. It also correctly handles the recursive cases, where it splits the subarray into two parts and calculates the maximum sum for each part.

The `make_stairs` function is used to construct the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. It correctly handles the case where the subarray is already in the desired state (i.e., all elements are equal to their index) and the case where the subarray needs to be modified to achieve the desired state.

Overall, the program correctly implements the recursive approach with memoization to solve the problem, and it correctly handles all the possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
