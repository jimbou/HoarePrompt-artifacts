Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by applying a specific function (`func_1`) to all subarrays within a given range (`start_index` to `end_index`) of an input array (`arr`), considering the values of the elements at the current index and the results of the function applied to subarrays. It uses memoization to store and reuse previously computed results. The function returns the maximum value obtained, which is either the value associated with the key in the dictionary `res_dict`, the maximum of 1 and the value of `arr` at the index `start_index` (when `start_index` equals `end_index`), or the maximum value of the function applied to all subarrays within the range plus the value of the element at the current index.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes as input two indices, start_index and end_index, and an array arr, and returns a list of tuples representing the subarrays that meet certain conditions. If the length of the subarray is 1 and the value at the start_index is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list. If the maximum value of the subarray is equal to the square of its length, the function returns a list containing a tuple of the start_index and end_index. Otherwise, the function iterates over the subarray and checks if the sum of the values at each index and the maximum values of the subarrays on either side is equal to the maximum value of the subarray. If such an index is found, the function returns the sum of the results of calling another function, func_2, on the subarrays on either side. If no such index is found, the function checks if the sum of the value at the start_index and the maximum value of the subarray starting from the next index is equal to the maximum value, and if so, returns the result of calling func_2 on the subarray starting from the next index. If none of these conditions are met, the function checks if the sum of the value at the end_index and the maximum value of the subarray ending at the previous index is equal to the maximum value, and if so, returns the result of calling func_2 on the subarray ending at the previous index.

Otherwise, the values of `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` have been updated to `i - 1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a subarray within a given array is already in a "staircase" configuration (i.e., each element is equal to its index within the subarray). If it is, the function returns without modifying the array. If not, the function recursively attempts to transform the subarray into a staircase configuration by updating the elements of the array and storing the start and end indices of the modified subarrays in a result list. The function takes four parameters: a non-negative integer `i`, a list of integers `arr`, a non-negative integer `start_index`, and a list of tuples `res`. The function returns nothing, but modifies the input array `arr` and the result list `res` in place.
