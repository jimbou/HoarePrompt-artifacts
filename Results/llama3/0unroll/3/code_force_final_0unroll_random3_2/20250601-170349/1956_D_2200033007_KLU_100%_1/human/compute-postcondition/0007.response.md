Output State: **i is 0, arr is a list of integers with arr[start_index] equal to 1, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, res is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers with (start_index, start_index) appended to it, is_already_stairs is False, and there exists a j in the range [0, 0] such that arr[start_index + j] is not equal to j.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The list `arr` has been modified such that the element at index `start_index` is now equal to 1. The value of `start_index` remains the same, within the valid range of indices for `arr`. The list `res` has been updated by appending a new tuple containing the value of `start_index` twice. The boolean variable `is_already_stairs` remains False. Additionally, the condition regarding the existence of a `j` in the range `[0, 0]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` still holds true, as the modification to `arr` at index `start_index` does not affect this condition.
