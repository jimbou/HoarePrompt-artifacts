Output State: **i is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, res is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and is_already_stairs is False. Additionally, there exists a j in the range [0, i] such that arr[start_index + j] is not equal to j. Moreover, arr[start_index + i] is not equal to i. res now contains the tuple (start_index, start_index + i).**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `arr`, `start_index`, and `is_already_stairs` remain unchanged. The list `res` has been updated to include the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, which represents the range of indices in `arr` that have been processed. The existence of a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` and `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i` is still valid, as the code does not modify the values in `arr`.
