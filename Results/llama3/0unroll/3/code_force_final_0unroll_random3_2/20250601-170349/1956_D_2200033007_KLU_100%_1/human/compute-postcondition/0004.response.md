Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with `i` being a non-negative integer, `arr` being a list of integers, `start_index` being a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, and `res` being a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. Additionally, `is_already_stairs` remains True, indicating that for all `j` in the range `[0, i]`, `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`.**
