Output State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is True if and only if the subarray of `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` is a staircase (i.e., each element is equal to its index in the subarray), otherwise `is_already_stairs` is False.
