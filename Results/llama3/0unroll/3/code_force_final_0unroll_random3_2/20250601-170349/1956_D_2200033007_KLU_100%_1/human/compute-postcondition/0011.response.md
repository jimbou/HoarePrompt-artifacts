Output State: **`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i-1]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`. The current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, and the range of `j` has been updated to `[0, i-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, but its effect on the state is not specified, so we assume it only changes the value of `i`.
