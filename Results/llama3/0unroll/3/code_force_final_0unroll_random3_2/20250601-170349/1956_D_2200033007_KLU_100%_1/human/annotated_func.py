#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes as input two indices, start_index and end_index, and an array arr, and returns a list of tuples representing the subarrays that meet certain conditions. If the length of the subarray is 1 and the value at the start_index is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list. If the maximum value of the subarray is equal to the square of its length, the function returns a list containing a tuple of the start_index and end_index. Otherwise, the function iterates over the subarray and checks if the sum of the values at each index and the maximum values of the subarrays on either side is equal to the maximum value of the subarray. If such an index is found, the function returns the sum of the results of calling another function, func_2, on the subarrays on either side. If no such index is found, the function checks if the sum of the value at the start_index and the maximum value of the subarray starting from the next index is equal to the maximum value, and if so, returns the result of calling func_2 on the subarray starting from the next index. If none of these conditions are met, the function checks if the sum of the value at the end_index and the maximum value of the subarray ending at the previous index is equal to the maximum value, and if so, returns the result of calling func_2 on the subarray ending at the previous index.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a subarray within a given array is already in a "staircase" configuration (i.e., each element is equal to its index within the subarray). If it is, the function returns without modifying the array. If not, the function recursively attempts to transform the subarray into a staircase configuration by updating the elements of the array and storing the start and end indices of the modified subarrays in a result list. The function takes four parameters: a non-negative integer `i`, a list of integers `arr`, a non-negative integer `start_index`, and a list of tuples `res`. The function returns nothing, but modifies the input array `arr` and the result list `res` in place.
