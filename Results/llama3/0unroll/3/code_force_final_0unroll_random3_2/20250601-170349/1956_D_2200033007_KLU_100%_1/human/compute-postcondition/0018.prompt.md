You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1, and res is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers.
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False if there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, otherwise `is_already_stairs` is True.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with `i` being a non-negative integer, `arr` being a list of integers, `start_index` being a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, and `res` being a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. Additionally, `is_already_stairs` remains True, indicating that for all `j` in the range `[0, i]`, `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`.
    #State: *`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement in the given code snippet. The program simply terminates without returning any value.
    #State: *`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: Output State: The values of arr from index start_index to start_index + i have been updated to i.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: *`i` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, `res` is a list of tuples of two non-negative integers, and `is_already_stairs` is False. Additionally, there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then there exists a `j` in the range `[0, i-1]` such that `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j` and the current value of `arr[start_index + i-1]` is equal to `i-1`. Otherwise, the values of `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` have been updated to `i - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with `i` being a non-negative integer, `arr` being a list of integers, `start_index` being a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i` - 1, and `res` being a list of tuples of two non-negative integers. Additionally, `is_already_stairs` remains True, indicating that for all `j` in the range `[0, i]`, `arr[start_index + j]` is equal to `j`.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement in the given code snippet. The program simply terminates without returning any value.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
