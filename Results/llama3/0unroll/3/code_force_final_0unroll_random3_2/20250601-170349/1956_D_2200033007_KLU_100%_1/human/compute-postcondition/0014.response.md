Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated. The value of the variable 'j' has been incremented from 'start_index' to 'start_index + i', and the value of 'arr[j]' has been set to 'i' for each iteration. The other variables in the precondition, 'i', 'arr', 'start_index', 'res', and 'is_already_stairs', remain unchanged.
