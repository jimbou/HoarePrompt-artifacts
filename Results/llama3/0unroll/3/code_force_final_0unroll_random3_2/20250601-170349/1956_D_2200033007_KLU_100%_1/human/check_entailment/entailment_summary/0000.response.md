Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum sum of elements in an array by performing a specific operation (setting a subarray to its MEX) no more than 5 * 10^5 times.
2. Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by applying the operation to all subarrays within a given range of the input array. It uses memoization to store and reuse previously computed results, which is efficient for this problem.
3. Function 2 (`func_2`) takes the result of `func_1` and constructs a list of tuples representing the subarrays that need to be modified to achieve the maximum sum. It correctly handles the cases where the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, and where the maximum value is not equal to the square of the subarray length.
4. Function 3 (`make_stairs`) is a helper function that transforms a subarray into a "staircase" configuration, which is necessary for achieving the maximum sum. It correctly checks if the subarray is already in a staircase configuration and modifies it accordingly.

The program correctly uses these functions to find the maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum. The output format is also correct, as it prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
