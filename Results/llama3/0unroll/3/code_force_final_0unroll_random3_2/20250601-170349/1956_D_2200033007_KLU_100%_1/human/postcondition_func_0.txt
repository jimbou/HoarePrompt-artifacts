This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by applying a specific function (`func_1`) to all subarrays within a given range (`start_index` to `end_index`) of an input array (`arr`), considering the values of the elements at the current index and the results of the function applied to subarrays. It uses memoization to store and reuse previously computed results. The function returns the maximum value obtained, which is either the value associated with the key in the dictionary `res_dict`, the maximum of 1 and the value of `arr` at the index `start_index` (when `start_index` equals `end_index`), or the maximum value of the function applied to all subarrays within the range plus the value of the element at the current index.
