Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input array contains a zero at the end. In this case, the function `func_2` will not be able to find a way to maximize the sum of the elements, because it only checks for the maximum value by splitting the array into two parts or by keeping the current element and recursively calling `func_2` on the rest of the array. However, when the array ends with a zero, the maximum sum can be achieved by replacing the zero with the length of the array, which is not considered by the function.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 2, 3, 0]`, the program will not be able to find the maximum sum, which is `16` (by replacing the zero with `4`). The program will only find a sum of `14` (by keeping the current elements).
