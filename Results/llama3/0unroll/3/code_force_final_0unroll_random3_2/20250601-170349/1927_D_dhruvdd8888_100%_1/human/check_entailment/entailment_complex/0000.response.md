Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

Here's why:

1. The program correctly groups consecutive equal integers in the list into subarrays and stores their start and end indices, along with the integer value. This is done by iterating over the list and appending a tuple to the 'arr' list whenever a new integer is encountered.

2. For each query pair (l, r), the program correctly finds the subarray that contains the range [l, r] using binary search. It uses the 'bisect_left' function from the 'bisect' module to find the insertion point for the tuple (l, 0, 0) in the 'arr' list, which is sorted by the start index of the subarrays.

3. The program then checks if the found subarray contains the range [l, r] and prints the start and end indices of the subarray if it exists, or (-1, -1) if no such subarray is found. It handles edge cases where the range [l, r] is not fully contained within a subarray or is outside the bounds of the list.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the range [l, r] is not fully contained within a subarray by checking if the start index of the subarray is greater than 'l' and if the end index of the subarray is less than or equal to 'r'.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the range [l, r] is outside the bounds of the list by checking if the start index of the subarray is greater than 'l' and if the end index of the subarray is less than 'N'.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the range [l, r] is fully contained within a subarray by printing the start and end indices of the subarray.

7. The program correctly handles the case where no subarray contains the range [l, r] by printing (-1, -1).

Therefore, the given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Correctness: **True**
