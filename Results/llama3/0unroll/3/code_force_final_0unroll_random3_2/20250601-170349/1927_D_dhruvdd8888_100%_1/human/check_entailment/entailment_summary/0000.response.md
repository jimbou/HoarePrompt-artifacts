Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j for each query.

The program first groups consecutive equal integers in the list into subarrays and stores their start and end indices, along with the integer value. This is done efficiently using a single pass through the list.

Then, for each query pair (l, r), it uses binary search to find the subarray that contains the range [l, r]. If such a subarray is found, it prints the start and end indices of the subarray. If no such subarray is found, it prints (-1, -1).

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the range [l, r] is not fully contained within a subarray or is outside the bounds of the list.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
