stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then multiple pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list of integers. The second integer is the number of pairs of integers. The list of integers contains integers between 1 and 10^6. The pairs of integers are boundaries of a query and are between 1 and the length of the list of integers.
