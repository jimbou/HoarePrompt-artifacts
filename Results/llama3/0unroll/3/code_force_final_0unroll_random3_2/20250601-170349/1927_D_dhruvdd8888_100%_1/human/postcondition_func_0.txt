This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer q, and q pairs of integers. It groups consecutive equal integers in the list into subarrays and stores their start and end indices, along with the integer value. Then, for each query pair (l, r), it finds the subarray that contains the range [l, r] and prints the start and end indices of the subarray if it exists, or (-1, -1) if no such subarray is found. The function handles edge cases where the range [l, r] is not fully contained within a subarray or is outside the bounds of the list.
