Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices i and j (or determining that they do not exist) such that l ≤ i ≤ r, l ≤ j ≤ r, and a_i ≠ a_j for each query.

The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables. It then creates a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a subarray of the original list of integers. The first element of each tuple is the starting index of the subarray plus one, the second element is the ending index of the subarray, and the third element is the value of the subarray.

The program then iterates over the queries. For each query, it uses binary search to find the index of the tuple in the list that corresponds to the subarray that contains the left boundary of the query. It then checks the starting and ending indices of this subarray to determine if there are two different elements in the subarray that are within the boundaries of the query. If such elements exist, it prints their indices; otherwise, it prints -1 -1.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the subarray that contains the left boundary of the query starts before the left boundary, ends after the right boundary, or does not exist.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
