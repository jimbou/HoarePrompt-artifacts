You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and finally q pairs of integers. The integers in the list are between 1 and 10^6. The integers in the pairs are between 1 and n.
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed N+1 iterations. The variable 'i' has the value N, 'num' has the value -1, 's' has the value N, and 'arr' contains N tuples, each representing a subarray of the original list of N integers. The first element of each tuple is the starting index of the subarray plus one, the second element is the ending index of the subarray, and the third element is the value of the subarray. The 'nums' list and the 'e' variable remain unchanged.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed 0 iterations. The variable 'i' has the value 0, 'num' has the value -1, 's' has the value 0, 'arr' contains 0 tuples, each representing a subarray of the original list of 0 integers. The first element of each tuple is the starting index of the subarray plus one, the second element is the ending index of the subarray, and the third element is the value of the subarray. The 'nums' list and the 'e' variable remain unchanged. 'LA' has the value -1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
