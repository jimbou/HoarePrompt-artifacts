Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in a given array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program uses a technique of grouping consecutive equal elements in the array and storing their start and end indices along with the value of the elements in a list `arr`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `tc` and iterating over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums` itself, and the number of queries `q`.
3.  It then initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of the array. It also appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of the array to simplify the logic for the last group of equal elements.
4.  The program then iterates over the array, and whenever it encounters an element that is different from the current `num`, it appends a tuple `(s + 1, i, num)` to the list `arr`, where `s + 1` is the start index of the group, `i` is the end index of the group, and `num` is the value of the elements in the group. It then updates `s` to the current index `i`.
5.  After processing the entire array, the program iterates over each query. For each query, it uses binary search to find the index `eli` in the list `arr` such that the start index of the group at `eli` is greater than or equal to the query's left boundary `l`.
6.  It then retrieves the start and end indices `s` and `e` of the group at `eli`, along with the value of the elements in the group.
7.  Based on the values of `s` and `e` relative to the query's boundaries `l` and `r`, the program determines whether it can find two indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions. If it can, it prints the indices; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.
