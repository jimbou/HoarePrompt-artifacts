This function resolves a card game by processing a series of test cases from standard input. It takes no parameters and returns no value. For each test case, it reads the trump suit and a set of cards, then resolves the cards according to the game rules, printing the resolved cards to standard output. If a test case cannot be resolved, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits. The function processes all test cases in the input, printing the resolved cards for each case.
