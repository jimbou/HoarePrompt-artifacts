Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the card game and resolves the cards in each test case according to those rules. The program handles all possible cases, including when a test case cannot be resolved, in which case it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly uses the trump suit and the ranks of the cards to determine which cards can beat which other cards. The use of a dictionary to keep track of the suits and their corresponding ranks is a good approach, and the program correctly updates this dictionary as it processes each card.

The program also correctly handles the case where there are remaining trump cards after all other cards have been resolved, printing these cards in pairs as required by the game rules.

Overall, the program is well-structured and correctly implements the rules of the card game.

Correctness: **True**
