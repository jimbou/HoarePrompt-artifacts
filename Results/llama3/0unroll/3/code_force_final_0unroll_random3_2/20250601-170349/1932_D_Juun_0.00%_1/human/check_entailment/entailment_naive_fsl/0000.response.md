Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when there are two cards of the same suit and rank in the discard pile. In this case, the program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" because it cannot find a way to beat one card with the other. However, it is possible to beat one card with the other if they have the same suit and rank.

For example, if the input is:

3
S
3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S 3S

The program will print "IMPOSSIBLE" because it cannot find a way to beat one 3S with the other. However, it is possible to beat one 3S with the other because they have the same suit and rank.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
