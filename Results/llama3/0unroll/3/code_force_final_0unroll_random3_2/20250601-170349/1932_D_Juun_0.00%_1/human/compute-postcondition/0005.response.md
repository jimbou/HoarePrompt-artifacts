Output State: **trump is the trump suit of the second test case, trumps is an empty list, answers contains the resolved cards for the current test case, and suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None.**

The code sorts the list `trumps` in ascending order. Since `trumps` is initially an empty list, sorting it does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected.
