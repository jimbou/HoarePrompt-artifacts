Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and 2n distinct two-character strings representing the cards, where the first character is the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', or '9') and the second character is the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). trump is the trump suit of the first test case, trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, and suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None.**

The first line reads and discards the first integer from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. The second line reads the trump suit of the first test case and assigns it to the variable trump. The third and fourth lines initialize two empty lists, trumps and answers, respectively. The fifth line initializes a dictionary suits with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None. No other variables are affected.
