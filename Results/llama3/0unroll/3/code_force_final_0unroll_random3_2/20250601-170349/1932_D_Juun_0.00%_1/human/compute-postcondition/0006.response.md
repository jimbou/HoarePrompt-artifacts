Output State: **trumps is an empty list.**

The loop will continue to execute until the trumps list is empty. In each iteration, two elements are popped from the trumps list and printed. Since the loop condition is trumps != [], the loop will stop when trumps is an empty list. Therefore, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will be that trumps is an empty list.
