Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and 2n distinct two-character strings representing the cards, where the first character is the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', or '9') and the second character is the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). trump is the trump suit of the first test case, trumps is an empty list, answers is an empty list, and suits is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values None.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
