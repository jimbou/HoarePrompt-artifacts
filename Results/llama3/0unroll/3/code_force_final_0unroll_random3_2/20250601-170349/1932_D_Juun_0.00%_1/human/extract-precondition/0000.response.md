Precondition: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character representing the trump suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'), and 2n distinct two-character strings representing the cards, where the first character is the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', or '9') and the second character is the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S').**
