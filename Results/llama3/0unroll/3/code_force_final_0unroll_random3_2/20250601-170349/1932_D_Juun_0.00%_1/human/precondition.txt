stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 16), a character (one of "CDHS"), and a space-separated list of 2n two-character strings, each representing a card with a rank (one of "23456789") and a suit (one of "CDHS"). All cards are different.
