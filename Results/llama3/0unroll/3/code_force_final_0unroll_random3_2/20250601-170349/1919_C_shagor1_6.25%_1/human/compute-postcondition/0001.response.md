Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It then processes the list to find the number of times the largest value (y) needs to be updated when the current value is greater than both the largest (y) and second largest (x) values. The function prints the count of such updates for each test case.**
