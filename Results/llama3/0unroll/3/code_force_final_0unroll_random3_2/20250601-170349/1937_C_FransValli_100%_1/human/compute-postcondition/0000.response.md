Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is the final state of the variables after the last iteration. The variable 'maxi' holds the maximum value found in the last test case, 'mini' holds the minimum value found in the last test case, and 'arr' holds the list of values that are equal to the minimum value found in the last test case. The input buffer is empty, and the output buffer contains the results of all the print statements executed during the loop iterations.**
