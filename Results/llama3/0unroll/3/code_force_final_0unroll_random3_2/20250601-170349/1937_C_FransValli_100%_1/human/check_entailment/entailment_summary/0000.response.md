Reasoning:
The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where it needs to find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The program uses a query-based approach to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of indices and determine the maximum and minimum values.

The program first finds the maximum value by comparing each index with the current maximum. It then finds the minimum value by comparing the maximum value with each index and updating the list of indices with equal minimum values. Finally, it finds the minimum value among the list of equal minimum values and outputs the maximum and minimum indices.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses at most 3n queries as required by the problem statement. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, iterating through all test cases and outputting the maximum and minimum values found in the last test case.

Correctness: **True**
