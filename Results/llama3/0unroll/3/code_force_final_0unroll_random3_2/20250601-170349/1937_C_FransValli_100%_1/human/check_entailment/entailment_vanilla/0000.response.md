Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It first finds the index `maxi` of the maximum element in the array by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the indices of the elements that have the same maximum value as `maxi` and stores them in the list `arr`. Finally, it finds the index `mini` of the minimum element among the elements in `arr` by comparing each element with the current minimum.

The program uses at most 3n queries, as required by the problem statement. The first loop uses n-1 queries to find `maxi`, the second loop uses n-1 queries to find the elements with the same maximum value as `maxi`, and the third loop uses at most n-1 queries to find `mini`.

The program correctly finds the indices `maxi` and `mini` such that `p[maxi] ^ p[mini]` is maximized, as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
