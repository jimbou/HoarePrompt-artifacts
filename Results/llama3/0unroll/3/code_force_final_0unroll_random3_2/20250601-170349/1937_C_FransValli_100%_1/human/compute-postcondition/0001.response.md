Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer 'n'. For each test case, it finds the maximum and minimum values within a range of 1 to 'n' by querying the input buffer and updates the output buffer with the results. The function iterates through all test cases, and after the last iteration, it outputs the maximum and minimum values found in the last test case, along with the list of values equal to the minimum value. The function does not return any values but modifies the output buffer with the results of all test cases.**
