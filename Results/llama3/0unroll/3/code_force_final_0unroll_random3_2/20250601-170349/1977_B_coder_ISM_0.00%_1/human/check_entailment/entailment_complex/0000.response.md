Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to find a valid array of integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} for a given positive integer x.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the positive integer x and converts it to its binary representation using the bitwise AND operator (&) and the pow function.
3. The program then applies the required modifications to the binary string:
	* It replaces consecutive '1's with '-1' and '0' by iterating over the string and checking if the current character and the next character are both '1'. If so, it replaces the current character with '-1' and the next character with '0'.
	* It then swaps any '-1' followed by '1' with '0' and '-1' by iterating over the string again and checking if the current character is '-1' and the next character is '1'. If so, it swaps them.
4. After applying the modifications, the program prints the modified binary representation along with its length.
5. The program repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
