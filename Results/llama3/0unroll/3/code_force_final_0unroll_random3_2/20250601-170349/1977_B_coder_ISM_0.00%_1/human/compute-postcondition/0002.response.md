Output State: The loop will have executed `t` number of times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). After each execution, the loop will have printed the binary representation of the input number `x` with some modifications. The modifications include changing consecutive '1's to '-1' and '0', and then changing any '-1' followed by '1' to '0' and '-1'. The loop will also print the length of the modified binary representation. The output state will be the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop will have printed the modified binary representations and their lengths for each of the `t` test cases.
