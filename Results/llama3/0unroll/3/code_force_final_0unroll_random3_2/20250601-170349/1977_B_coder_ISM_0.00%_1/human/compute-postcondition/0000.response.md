Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads a line from the standard input (stdin).
	* Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first line of input contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases.
	* `int()` converts the read input to an integer.
	* The value of `t` is assigned the converted integer.

Now, let's calculate the output state:

* `t` is assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
* The remaining test cases are still in the stdin, waiting to be read.
* The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line already read)**
