#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. Each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 <= x < 2^30).
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        
        s = []
        
        length = 30
        
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')

                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'

    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `t` number of times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). After each execution, the loop will have printed the binary representation of the input number `x` with some modifications. The modifications include changing consecutive '1's to '-1' and '0', and then changing any '-1' followed by '1' to '0' and '-1'. The loop will also print the length of the modified binary representation. The output state will be the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the loop will have printed the modified binary representations and their lengths for each of the `t` test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case is a positive integer. For each test case, it converts the integer to its binary representation, applies a series of modifications to the binary string (replacing consecutive '1's with '-1' and '0', and then swapping any '-1' followed by '1' with '0' and '-1'), and prints the modified binary representation along with its length. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, leaving the program state unchanged after execution.
