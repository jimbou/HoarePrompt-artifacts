Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the input 2. The program outputs [1, 0, 1] with a length of 3, but the correct output should be [0, 1] with a length of 2, because 2 can be represented as 2^1, which corresponds to the array [0, 1]. 

The issue arises from the fact that the program does not handle the case where the input number is a power of 2 correctly. It incorrectly adds an extra '1' at the end of the array, which is not necessary. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle the case where the input number is a power of 2 separately.
