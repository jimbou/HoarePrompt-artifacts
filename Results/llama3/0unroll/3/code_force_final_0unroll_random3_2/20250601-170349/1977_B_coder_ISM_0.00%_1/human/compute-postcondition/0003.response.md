Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case is a positive integer. For each test case, it converts the integer to its binary representation, applies a series of modifications to the binary string (replacing consecutive '1's with '-1' and '0', and then swapping any '-1' followed by '1' with '0' and '-1'), and prints the modified binary representation along with its length. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, leaving the program state unchanged after execution.**
