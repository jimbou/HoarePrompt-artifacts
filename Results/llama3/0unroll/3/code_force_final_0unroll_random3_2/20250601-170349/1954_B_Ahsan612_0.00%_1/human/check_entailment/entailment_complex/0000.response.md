Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same number in a list of integers. The program iterates through the list, tracking the count of consecutive occurrences of the same number, and updates the minimum count if a smaller count is found. If no consecutive occurrences are found, it outputs -1.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the list contains only one unique number (in which case it outputs -1) or when the list is empty (in which case it doesn't output anything).

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases and the list of integers from stdin and printing the minimum count for each test case.

The use of the `inf` variable to initialize the minimum count is a good practice, as it ensures that the minimum count is updated correctly even if the list contains only one unique number.

Overall, the program is well-structured, readable, and correct.

Correctness: **True**
