Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its neighboring elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the length of the current sequence of the same number. It updates the minimum length of such a sequence as it iterates through the array. If the minimum length is still infinity at the end of the iteration, it means that all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of the sequence.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same.

Correctness: **True**
