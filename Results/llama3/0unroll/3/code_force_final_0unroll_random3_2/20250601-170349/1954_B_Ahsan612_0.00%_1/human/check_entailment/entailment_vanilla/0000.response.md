Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are the same. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, which is stored in the variable `minn`. If `minn` is still infinity at the end of the iteration, it means that all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program increments the index `i` twice in each iteration of the while loop, which means that it skips every other element in the array. This is incorrect because the program needs to check every element in the array to find the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same.

Correctness: **False**
