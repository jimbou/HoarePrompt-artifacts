Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same number in a list of integers. The program iterates through the list, tracking the count of consecutive occurrences of the same number, and updates the minimum count if a smaller count is found. If no consecutive occurrences are found, it outputs -1. The program processes all test cases and prints the minimum count for each case.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the list contains only one unique number (in which case it outputs -1), and when the list contains multiple unique numbers (in which case it outputs the minimum count of consecutive occurrences).

The program also correctly handles the constraints on the input, such as the number of test cases, the length of the list, and the range of the numbers in the list.

Correctness: **True**
