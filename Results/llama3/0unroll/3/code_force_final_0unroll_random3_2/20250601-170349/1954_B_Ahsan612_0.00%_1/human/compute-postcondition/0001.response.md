Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the same number in each list of integers. For each test case, it iterates through the list, tracking the count of consecutive occurrences of the same number, and updates the minimum count if a smaller count is found. If no consecutive occurrences are found, it outputs -1. The function processes all test cases and prints the minimum count for each case.**
