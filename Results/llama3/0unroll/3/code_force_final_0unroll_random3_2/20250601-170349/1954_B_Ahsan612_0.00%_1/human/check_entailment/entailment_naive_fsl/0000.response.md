Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has only one element. In this case, the program will output -1, but the correct output should be -1 only if it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that it stops being beautiful. If the array has only one element, it is already not beautiful, so the correct output should be 0.

For example, if the input is:

1
1

The program will output -1, but the correct output should be 0.
