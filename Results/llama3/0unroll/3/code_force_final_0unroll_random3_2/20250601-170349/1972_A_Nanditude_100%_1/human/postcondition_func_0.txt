This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two sorted lists of integers. It then compares the elements of the two lists and prints the count of elements in the second list that are less than the corresponding element in the first list. The function repeats this process for each test case and finally leaves the standard input empty.
