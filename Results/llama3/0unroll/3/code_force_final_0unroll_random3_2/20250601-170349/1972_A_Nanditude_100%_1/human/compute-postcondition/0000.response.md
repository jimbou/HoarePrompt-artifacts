Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two lists of integers of the same length as the first integer. The lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case because one test case has been read and processed. The remaining test cases still contain three inputs: an integer and two lists of integers of the same length as the first integer, and the lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
