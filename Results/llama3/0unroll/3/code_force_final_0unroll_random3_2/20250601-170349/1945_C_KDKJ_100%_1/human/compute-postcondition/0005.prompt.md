Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, where the first list contains 0 and 0, and each subsequent list contains the cumulative count of 0s and 1s in the string `a` up to that point, `ans` is -1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = i
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - i
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
