Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the position of the road in the village of Letovo such that at least half of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

Function func_1 reads an integer n and a string a of length n from standard input, where a consists only of 0s and 1s. It calculates the cumulative count of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the index closest to the middle of the string where the cumulative count of 0s and 1s is closest to half the length of the string. The function then prints this index.

Function func_2 reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer followed by a string of 0s and 1s. The function processes each test case by calling func_1.

Based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, it can be concluded that the program is correct. The program correctly calculates the cumulative count of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the index closest to the middle of the string where the cumulative count of 0s and 1s is closest to half the length of the string. The program also correctly processes multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
