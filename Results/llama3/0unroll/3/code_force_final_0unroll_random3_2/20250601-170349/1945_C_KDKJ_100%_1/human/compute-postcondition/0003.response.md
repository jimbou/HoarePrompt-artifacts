Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0 and 1, `S` is a list containing `n+1` lists, where the first list contains 0 and 0, and each subsequent list contains the cumulative count of 0s and 1s in the string `a` up to that point, `ans` is -1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been initialized to -1, while the values of `n`, `a`, and `S` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as no input operation was performed.
