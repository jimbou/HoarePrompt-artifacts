Functionality: **This function reads an integer n and a string a of length n from standard input, where a consists only of 0s and 1s. It calculates the cumulative count of 0s and 1s in the string and finds the index closest to the middle of the string where the cumulative count of 0s and 1s is closest to half the length of the string. The function then prints this index.**
