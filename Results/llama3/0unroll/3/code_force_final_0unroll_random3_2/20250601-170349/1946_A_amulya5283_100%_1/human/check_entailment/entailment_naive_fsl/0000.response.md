Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array has an even number of elements and the median is the average of the two middle elements. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4]. The median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5. However, the program will calculate the median as 2 (the smaller of the two middle elements) and then incorrectly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

To fix this issue, the program needs to handle the case when the array has an even number of elements and the median is the average of the two middle elements.
