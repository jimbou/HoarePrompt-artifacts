This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers. It sorts the list and prints the number of occurrences of the median element for each test case. If the list contains only one element, it prints 1. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results in the same order they were input.
