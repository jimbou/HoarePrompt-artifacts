Reasoning: 

The program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. 

Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (n) and the array itself (a).

3. It sorts the array in ascending order.

4. If the length of the array is 1, it prints 1 because the median of a single-element array is the element itself, and increasing it requires one operation.

5. If the length of the array is more than 1, it calculates the index of the median element (mdx). The median of an array with an odd length is the middle element, and the median of an array with an even length is the average of the two middle elements. However, in this problem, we are only interested in increasing the median, so we consider the lower median (the smaller of the two middle elements in the case of an even-length array).

6. It then counts the number of occurrences of the median element in the sorted array, starting from the median index (mdx) to the end of the array. This is because increasing any of these occurrences will increase the median.

7. Finally, it prints the count, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Correctness: **True**
