Output State: **The output state is the number of occurrences of the median element in the sorted list for each test case.**

In natural language, the output state is the count of the middle element in the sorted list for each test case. The loop iterates over each test case, sorts the list of integers, and then counts the occurrences of the median element (which is the middle element in the sorted list). The count is then printed as the output for each test case.
