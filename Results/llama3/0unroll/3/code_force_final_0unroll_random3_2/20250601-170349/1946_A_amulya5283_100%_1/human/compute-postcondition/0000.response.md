The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. Since `t` is assigned the first integer from the input, `t` is a positive integer and does not exceed 10^5. The remaining input in stdin is a list of `t` integers, each followed by a list of n integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and does not exceed 10^5, stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers, n is a positive integer and does not exceed 10^5, the integers in the list are positive and do not exceed 10^9.**
