Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers.
2.  It sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
3.  If the list contains only one element, it prints 1, as the median of a single-element list is the element itself, and increasing it requires one operation.
4.  For lists with more than one element, the program calculates the median index `mdx` using the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula correctly handles both even and odd-length lists.
5.  The program then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the list and counts the number of occurrences of the median element. This is done using a simple loop that increments the `res` variable whenever it encounters an element equal to the median.
6.  Finally, the program prints the count of median occurrences, which represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases and outputs the results in the same order they were input.

Correctness: **True**
