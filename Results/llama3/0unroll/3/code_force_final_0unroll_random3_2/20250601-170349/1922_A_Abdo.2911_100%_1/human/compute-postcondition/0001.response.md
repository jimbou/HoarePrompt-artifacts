Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each corresponding to whether a test case has a possible combination of strings a, b, and c that meet the given conditions. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed will be equal to the initial value of t. The value of t will be unchanged, and the values of n, a, b, and c will be updated for each test case but will not be printed.**
