This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. It then checks for each test case whether there exists a combination of strings a, b, and c that meet certain conditions (i.e., a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i] but not both). If such a combination exists, it prints 'YES' to the console; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results, leaving the input values unchanged.
