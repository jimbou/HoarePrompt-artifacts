Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The program iterates over each character in the strings a, b, and c, and checks the conditions specified in the problem description.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

* If a[i] == b[i], it checks if c[i] != a[i]. If this condition is true, it sets possible to True and breaks the loop.
* If a[i] != b[i], it checks if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]. If this condition is false, it sets possible to True and breaks the loop.

The program correctly prints "YES" if possible is True, indicating that there exists a template t that matches the conditions, and "NO" otherwise.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
