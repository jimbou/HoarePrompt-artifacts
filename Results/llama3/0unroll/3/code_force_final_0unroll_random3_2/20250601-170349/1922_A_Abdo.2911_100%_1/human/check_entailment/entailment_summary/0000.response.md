Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program then checks for each character position `i` in the strings whether the conditions for a template `t` are met. Specifically, it checks:
	* If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) for the template to match.
	* If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must not be equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` for the template to match.
4. If the program finds a position `i` where the conditions are met, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
5. After checking all positions, if `possible` is `True`, the program prints "YES", indicating that a template `t` exists that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
