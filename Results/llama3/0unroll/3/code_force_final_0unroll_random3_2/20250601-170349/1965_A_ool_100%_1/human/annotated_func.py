#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'.
    #State: *A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged, and the first element of set_ is 1
    not_c = True

        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:

    #State: Output State: A is True, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, and not_c is False.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: A is True if not_c is False, otherwise A is False. set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, and not_c is True if not_c was originally True, otherwise not_c remains False.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Bob' because not_c is True, which makes A False.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner of a game based on a list of positive integers. The function takes a list of positive integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and checks if the list represents a contiguous sequence of integers starting from 1. If the sequence is contiguous, the function returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'.
