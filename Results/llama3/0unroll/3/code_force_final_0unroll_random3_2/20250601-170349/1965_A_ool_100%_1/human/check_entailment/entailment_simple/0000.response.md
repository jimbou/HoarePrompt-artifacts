Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the initial number of stones in each pile.

The function `func_1` first checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If it does, Alice can win by choosing k equal to the size of the smallest pile, so the function returns 'Alice'.

If the smallest pile has only one stone, the function checks if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. If they are, it means that Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, so Alice will lose. In this case, the function returns 'Bob'.

If the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are not all 1, it means that Alice can find a move that will leave Bob with a pile that has a size that is not a multiple of the smallest pile size. In this case, Alice will win, so the function returns 'Alice'.

The main part of the program reads the input, calls the function `func_1`, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
