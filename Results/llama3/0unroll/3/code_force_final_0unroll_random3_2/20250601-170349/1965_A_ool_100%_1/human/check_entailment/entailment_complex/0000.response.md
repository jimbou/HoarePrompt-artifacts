Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given list of positive integers. The function `func_1` takes a list of positive integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and checks if the list represents a contiguous sequence of integers starting from 1. If the sequence is contiguous, the function returns 'Bob', otherwise it returns 'Alice'. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the first player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

The program correctly handles the case where the smallest pile has only one stone, in which case Alice can only remove one stone from each pile, and Bob can win on the next turn. It also correctly handles the case where the smallest pile has more than one stone, in which case Alice can remove all stones from each pile and win.

The program also correctly handles the case where the list of piles is not contiguous, in which case Alice can win by removing stones from each pile in a way that leaves Bob with no valid moves.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
