Output State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the value False to the variable A. The second line creates a new list, set_, which contains the unique elements from the original list arr. The third line sorts the list set_ in ascending order. The original list arr remains unchanged throughout the execution of the code.
