Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
1 2 4

The program will output "Bob", but the correct output should be "Alice". This is because Alice can choose k=1 on her first turn, leaving the piles as 0, 1, 3. Then, Bob cannot make a move, and Alice wins.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the smallest pile is 1 and if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are 1. However, it does not consider the actual values of the piles and the possible moves that can be made. A correct solution would need to consider the game tree and the possible moves that can be made by both players.
