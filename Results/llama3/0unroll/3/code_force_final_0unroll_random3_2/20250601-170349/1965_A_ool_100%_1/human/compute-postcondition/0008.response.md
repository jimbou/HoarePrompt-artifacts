Output State: **A is False, set_ is a sorted list of unique positive integers from arr, arr remains unchanged, the first element of set_ is 1, and the current value of not_c is True**

In this output state, the value of A has been changed to False, because the code `A = not A` negates the original value of A, which was True. The other variables, set_, arr, and not_c, remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
