Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly simulates the game between Bodya and Sasha based on the input test cases. The program accurately updates the players' scores and determines the winner of the game.

The program first reads the input test cases, which include the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. It then reads the permutation and the array.

The program initializes variables to track the players' scores and their current positions. It then simulates the game by iterating through the turns. In each turn, it updates the players' scores and their current positions based on the permutation and the array.

The program uses a clever optimization to avoid unnecessary iterations. It keeps track of the maximum score that each player can achieve by staying at their current position or moving to the next position in the permutation. This allows it to break out of the loop early if the remaining turns are not enough to change the outcome of the game.

Finally, the program prints the result of each test case, indicating whether Bodya wins, Sasha wins, or the game ends in a draw.

Correctness: **True**
