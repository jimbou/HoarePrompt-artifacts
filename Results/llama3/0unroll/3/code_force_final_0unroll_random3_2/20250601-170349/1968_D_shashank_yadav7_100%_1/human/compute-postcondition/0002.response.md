Output State: The loop will execute t times, each time processing a test case from the input. The output will be a string indicating the winner of the game ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case. The variables n, k, b, s, p, a, sp, bp, bm, and sm will be updated accordingly for each test case, but their values will not be retained after each iteration. The final output state will be the last output string printed by the loop.
