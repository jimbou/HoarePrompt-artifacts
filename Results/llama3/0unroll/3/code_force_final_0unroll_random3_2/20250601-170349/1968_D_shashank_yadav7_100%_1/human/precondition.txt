The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S, where n is the length of the permutation, k is the duration of the game, and P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively. The second line contains a permutation p of length n, and the third line contains an array a of length n. n, k, P_B, P_S are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The permutation p and array a contain non-negative integers such that 1 <= p_i, a_i <= 10^9 for all i.
