This function simulates a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on input test cases. For each test case, it processes the game state, updating variables to track the players' scores, and determines the winner of the game. The function then prints the result of each test case, indicating whether Bodya wins, Sasha wins, or the game ends in a draw. The function iterates through multiple test cases, processing each one independently and printing the corresponding result.
