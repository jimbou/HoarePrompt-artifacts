Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The game lasts for k turns, but the program only simulates the game for n turns, where n is the length of the permutation. This means that if k is greater than n, the program will not correctly calculate the scores of the players.

For example, if the input is:

10
8 10 4 1
5 1 4 3 2 8 6 7
1 1 2 1 2 100 101 102

The program will only simulate the game for 8 turns, but the game actually lasts for 10 turns. This means that the program will not correctly calculate the scores of the players, and the output will be incorrect.

To fix this bug, the program should simulate the game for k turns, not n turns. The program should also handle the case where k is greater than n correctly.
