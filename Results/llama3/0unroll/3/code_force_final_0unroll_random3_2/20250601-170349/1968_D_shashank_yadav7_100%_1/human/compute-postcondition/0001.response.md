Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time processing a test case from the input. After all iterations, the output state will be a series of printed results, one for each test case, indicating whether 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' wins based on the calculated values of `bm` and `sm`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` will remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop.
