Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n integers representing the array a.**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `t` is now equal to the number of test cases. The stdin still contains the same test cases, but the first line of each test case has been read and is no longer in the input buffer. The values of the other variables are not affected.
