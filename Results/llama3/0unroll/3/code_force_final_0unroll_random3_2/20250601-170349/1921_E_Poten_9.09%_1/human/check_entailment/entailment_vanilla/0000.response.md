Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board between two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are well-defined in the problem description.

Upon analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the game's logic and rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input test cases and extracts the necessary information, such as the board dimensions, Alice's position, and Bob's position.
2. The program checks for the base cases where the game ends in a draw, such as when Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row. This is correctly implemented.
3. The program then checks for the cases where Alice or Bob can win. The logic for determining the winner is based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob, as well as the number of moves required to reach each other. This logic is correctly implemented, taking into account the game's rules and constraints.
4. The program handles the cases where the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's column positions is greater than 1, which requires additional checks to determine the winner. This is correctly implemented.
5. The program correctly outputs the result of each test case, either "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw", based on the game's outcome.

After carefully reviewing the program, I found no logical errors or inconsistencies with the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
