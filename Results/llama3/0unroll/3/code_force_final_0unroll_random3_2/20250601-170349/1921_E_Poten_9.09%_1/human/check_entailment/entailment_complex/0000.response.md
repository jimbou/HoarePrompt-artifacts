Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the input provided. The program checks various conditions to determine if the game is a draw or if either Alice or Bob wins. The conditions are based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob, the dimensions of the grid, and the number of moves each player can make.

The program handles all possible cases, including when Alice and Bob are on the same row or column, when they are on different rows and columns, and when the game is a draw. The program also correctly handles the case when the grid has only one row or column.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the game. The program's output matches the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
