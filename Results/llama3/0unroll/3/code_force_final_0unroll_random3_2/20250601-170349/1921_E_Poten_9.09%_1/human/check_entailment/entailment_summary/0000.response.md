Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the input provided. The program considers all possible scenarios and correctly determines whether the game is a 'Draw', or if either 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins.

The program first checks if Alice's initial position is below Bob's initial position or if the board has only one row. In these cases, the game is a 'Draw'. Then, it checks if the difference between Alice's and Bob's initial positions is even or odd. Based on this, it determines the possible moves for Alice and Bob and checks if either of them can win.

The program also correctly handles the cases where the difference between Alice's and Bob's initial positions is greater than 1. In these cases, it checks if the difference between their positions is greater than the absolute difference between their row positions divided by 2. If it is, the game is a 'Draw'. Otherwise, it checks if Alice or Bob can win based on their possible moves.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the input provided.

Correctness: **True**
