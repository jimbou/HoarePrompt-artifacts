Output State: **test_cases is an integer, answers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to test_cases. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers, and the first line reads one integer, stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The second line initializes an empty list called answers. No other variables are affected.
