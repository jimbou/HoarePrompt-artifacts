Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column but not in the same row, and the difference between their rows is greater than 1. In this case, the program should check if Alice can reach Bob's position by moving diagonally, but it does not do so.

For example, consider the input:

10 10 2 5 8 5

In this case, Alice is at position (2, 5) and Bob is at position (8, 5). The program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can reach Bob's position by moving diagonally.

The program only checks if the difference between Alice's and Bob's columns is greater than 1, but it does not check if the difference between their rows is greater than 1. Therefore, it does not correctly handle this case.
