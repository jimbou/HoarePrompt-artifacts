Output State: **The output state is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the corresponding input string can be split into two substrings that are not equal to the first character of the string. If the string can be split, the output also includes the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. The output state has the same length as the input list of strings.**
