Functionality: **This function takes a list of strings as input, where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters. It checks each string to determine if it can be split into two substrings that do not start with the same character as the original string. If such a split is possible, it outputs 'YES', the number of splits (1 or 2), and the resulting substrings. If no such split is possible, it outputs 'NO'. The function processes multiple input strings and returns a list of output strings, each corresponding to the result of the split check for the respective input string.**
