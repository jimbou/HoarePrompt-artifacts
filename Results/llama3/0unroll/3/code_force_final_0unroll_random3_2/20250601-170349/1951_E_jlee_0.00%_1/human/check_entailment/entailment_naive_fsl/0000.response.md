Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One case where the program fails is when the input string has a length of 2 and the two characters are different. In this case, the program should print "YES" and partition the string into two substrings of length 1, but it does not.

For example, if the input is "ab", the program should print:

YES
2
a b

But the program does not handle this case correctly.
