Output State: **The loop iterates over the input test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the values of s, e, and _ based on the input values l and r. If the current value of ppp is 23, it prints the list of N+1 integers, nums. The loop continues until all test cases have been processed. The final state of the variables is: N remains unchanged, nums remains unchanged, s and e have been updated based on the last test case, num remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged, LA remains unchanged, and stdin is empty.**
