Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer N, a list of N integers, an integer q, and q pairs of integers. The function groups consecutive equal integers in the list and stores the start and end indices of each group. Then, for each query pair (l, r), it finds the group that contains l and checks if r is within the same group. If so, it prints the start and end indices of the group. If not, it prints -1 -1. If the current value of ppp is 23, it prints the list of N+1 integers. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been consumed.**
