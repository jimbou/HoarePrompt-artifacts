Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the query range (l, r) is equal to the range of a single segment in the array. In this case, the program should return -1 -1 because there are no two different elements in the range. However, the program currently returns the start and end indices of the segment, which is incorrect.

For example, if the input array is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2] and the query is (1, 3), the program should return -1 -1 because there are no two different elements in the range [1, 3]. However, the program currently returns 1 3, which is incorrect.
