Output State: **N is a non-negative integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is 0, e is 0, num is the first integer in the list of N integers, arr is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the variable N holds a non-negative integer value, which is the number of integers in the first input. The variable nums is a list of N+1 integers, where the first N integers are the input integers and the last integer is -1. The variables s and e are initialized to 0. The variable num holds the value of the first integer in the list of N integers. The variable arr is an empty list. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now has three inputs remaining: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.
