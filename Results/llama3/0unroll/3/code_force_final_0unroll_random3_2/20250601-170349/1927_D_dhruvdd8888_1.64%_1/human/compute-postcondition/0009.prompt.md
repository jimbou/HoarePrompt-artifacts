You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n integers, then an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. n and q are non-negative integers and n is greater than 1.
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: N is a non-negative integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is N, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples, each containing three integers, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: A list of N+1 integers (where N is a non-negative integer)
    #State: *N is a non-negative integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is N, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples, each containing three integers, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. If the current value of ppp is 23, the list of N+1 integers, nums, is printed.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The loop iterates over the input test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the values of s, e, and _ based on the input values l and r. If the current value of ppp is 23, it prints the list of N+1 integers, nums. The loop continues until all test cases have been processed. The final state of the variables is: N remains unchanged, nums remains unchanged, s and e have been updated based on the last test case, num remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged, LA remains unchanged, and stdin is empty.

```

Return Postconditions: N is a non-negative integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is N, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples, each containing three integers, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers. The current value of ppp is 23, and the list of N+1 integers, nums, is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
