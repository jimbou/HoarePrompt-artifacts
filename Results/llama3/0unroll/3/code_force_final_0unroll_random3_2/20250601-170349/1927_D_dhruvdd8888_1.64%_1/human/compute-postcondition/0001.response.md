Output State: The loop iterates N+1 times, and after each iteration, the value of 'num' is updated to the current element in the 'nums' list. If the current element is different from the previous one, a tuple containing the index 'i', the current element, and the cumulative sum 's' is appended to the 'arr' list. The cumulative sum 's' is updated to the current index 'i'. The loop ends after N+1 iterations, and the final state is: N remains unchanged, nums remains unchanged, s is the last index N, e remains unchanged, num is the last element in the list of N integers, and arr contains tuples of indices, elements, and cumulative sums where the elements are different from the previous ones.
