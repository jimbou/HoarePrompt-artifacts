Based on the initial state, the code `print(nums)` will print the list of N+1 integers.

Since `nums` is a list of N+1 integers, the output will be a list containing N+1 integer values. The exact values of these integers are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot provide a specific numerical output.

However, we can describe the output as a list of N+1 integers, where N is a non-negative integer.

Output: **A list of N+1 integers (where N is a non-negative integer)**
