Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to find a pair of different elements among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r for each query, or report that such a pair does not exist. The program uses a binary search approach to find the appropriate range for each query, and it handles the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
