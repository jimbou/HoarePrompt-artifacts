Output State: **N is a non-negative integer, nums is a list of N+1 integers, s is N, e is 0, num is the last integer in the list of N integers, arr is a list of tuples, each containing three integers, LA is the second last index of arr, stdin contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining: an integer q, and then q pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of LA is calculated as the second last index of arr, which is one less than the length of arr. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases with three inputs remaining.
