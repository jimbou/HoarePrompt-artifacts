Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality by grouping consecutive equal integers in the list and then using these groups to answer the queries. The use of binary search (bisect_left) to find the group that contains the left boundary of the query is efficient, and the program handles edge cases correctly. The program also follows the specified input and output formats.


Correctness: **True**
