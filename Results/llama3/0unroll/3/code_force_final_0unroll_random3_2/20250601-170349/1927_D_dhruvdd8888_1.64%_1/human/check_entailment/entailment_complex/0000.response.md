Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly processes multiple test cases from standard input, groups consecutive equal integers in the list, and finds the group that contains the query pair (l, r) to determine if r is within the same group. The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the query pair (l, r) is not within the same group or when the current value of ppp is 23. 

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. The use of bisect_left from the bisect module to find the appropriate group for the query pair (l, r) is efficient and correct. The program also handles the case where the query pair (l, r) is not within the same group by checking if e >= r and printing -1 -1 accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
