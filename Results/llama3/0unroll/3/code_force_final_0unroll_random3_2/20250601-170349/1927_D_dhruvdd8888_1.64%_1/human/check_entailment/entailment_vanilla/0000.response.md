Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in a given array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program uses a technique of grouping consecutive equal elements together and storing their start and end indices in an array `arr`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums` itself, and the number of queries `q`.

3. It then initializes an array `arr` to store the start and end indices of consecutive equal elements in `nums`. It does this by iterating over `nums` and whenever it encounters a different element, it appends the start and end indices of the previous group to `arr`.

4. After constructing `arr`, the program iterates over each query. For each query, it uses binary search to find the index `eli` in `arr` such that the start index of the group at `eli` is greater than or equal to the query's left boundary `l`.

5. If `eli` is not out of bounds and the start index of the group at `eli` is greater than `l`, it means that the group at `eli-1` contains `l`. If the start index of the group at `eli-1` is 1, it means that all elements before `l` are equal, so the program prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints the end index of the group at `eli-1` and the start index of the group at `eli`.

6. If the start index of the group at `eli` is not greater than `l`, it means that `l` is within the group at `eli`. If the end index of the group at `eli` is greater than or equal to the query's right boundary `r`, it means that all elements between `l` and `r` are equal, so the program prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints the start index of the group at `eli` and the end index of the group at `eli` plus 1.

7. If `eli` is out of bounds, it means that all elements in `nums` are equal, so the program prints `-1 -1`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.
