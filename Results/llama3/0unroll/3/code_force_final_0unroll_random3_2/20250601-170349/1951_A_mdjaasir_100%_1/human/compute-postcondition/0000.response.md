Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains two inputs: first a binary string of the same length as the integer that was inputted before `t` and then another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case because one test case has been read and processed. Each remaining test case still contains two inputs: first a binary string of the same length as the integer that was inputted before `t`, and then another integer and a binary string of the same length as the integer.
