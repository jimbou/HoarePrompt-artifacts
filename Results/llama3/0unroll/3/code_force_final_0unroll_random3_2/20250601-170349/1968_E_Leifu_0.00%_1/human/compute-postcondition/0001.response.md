Output State: **The loop will print a series of numbers to the console, with each iteration of the outer loop printing a different set of numbers. The first two lines of each iteration will always be "1 1" and "1 2". If the input number `n` is 3, the third line will be "2 3", otherwise it will be "2 4". For `n` greater than 3, the loop will print additional lines with the number `j` repeated twice, where `j` ranges from 4 to `n` inclusive. The value of `t` will be unchanged, and the input numbers will be consumed from stdin.**
