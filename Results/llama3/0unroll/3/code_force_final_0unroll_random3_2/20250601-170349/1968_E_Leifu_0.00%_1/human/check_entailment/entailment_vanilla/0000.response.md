Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes the number of test cases (t) as input, and then for each test case, it takes the size of the grid (n) as input.

The program starts by printing the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for all test cases. This is a valid starting point, as these two points will always have a Manhattan distance of 1.

For n = 3, the program prints the coordinate (2, 3) in addition to the initial two points. This is also a valid solution, as the set of Manhattan distances will be {0, 1, 2, 3}, which has a size of 4.

For n > 3, the program prints the coordinate (2, 4) in addition to the initial two points. Then, it enters a loop that prints the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n. This is also a valid solution, as the set of Manhattan distances will include all values from 0 to n-1, which has a size of n.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
