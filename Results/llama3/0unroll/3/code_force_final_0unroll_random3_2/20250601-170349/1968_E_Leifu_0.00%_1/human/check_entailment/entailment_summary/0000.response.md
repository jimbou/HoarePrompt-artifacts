Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by printing a series of numbers to the console, with each set of numbers corresponding to a different input number `n`. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

For `n = 3`, the program prints "1 1", "1 2", and "2 3", which is a correct solution. However, for `n > 3`, the program prints "1 1", "1 2", "2 4", and then additional lines with repeated numbers from 4 to `n`. This is not a correct solution, as it does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

In particular, the program fails to consider the optimal arrangement of cells for `n > 3`, which involves placing cells in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances. The program's approach of simply printing repeated numbers from 4 to `n` does not achieve this goal.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for `n > 3`, and the overall correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
