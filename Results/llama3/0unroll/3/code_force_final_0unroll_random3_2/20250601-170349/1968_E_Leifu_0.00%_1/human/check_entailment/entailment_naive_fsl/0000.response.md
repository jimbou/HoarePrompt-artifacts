Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4

However, the correct output should be:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

The program does not correctly handle the case when n is even and greater than 2. It prints the same output for n = 3 and n = 4, which is incorrect.

The program should be modified to handle the case when n is even and greater than 2 correctly. One possible solution is to use a different approach to generate the output, such as using a loop to generate the coordinates of the cells.

Here is an example of a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if j % 2 == 1:
                print('1 ' + str(j))
            else:
                print(str(n) + ' ' + str(j))

This program correctly handles the case when n is even and greater than 2, and generates the correct output for all potential cases.
