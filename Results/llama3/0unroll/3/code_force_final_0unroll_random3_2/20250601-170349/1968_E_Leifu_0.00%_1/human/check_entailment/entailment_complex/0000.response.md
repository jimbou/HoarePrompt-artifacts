Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints a series of numbers to the console, with each set of numbers corresponding to a different input number n. For each n, it prints "1 1" and "1 2", followed by either "2 3" if n is 3, or "2 4" and additional lines with repeated numbers from 4 to n if n is greater than 3.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances can be achieved by placing the cells in a specific pattern. For n = 3, the optimal arrangement is (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which gives a set of distinct Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3}. For n > 3, the optimal arrangement is to place the cells in a diagonal pattern, starting from (1,1) and (1,2), and then placing the remaining cells in a diagonal line, which gives a set of distinct Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints the optimal arrangement for each input number n.

Correctness: **True**
