Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program starts by printing the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for each test case. If n is 3, it prints the coordinate (2, 3). Otherwise, it prints the coordinate (2, 4) and then prints the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n inclusive.

The program's approach is based on the observation that the Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is equal to |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. By placing cells at coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3) for n = 3, and at coordinates (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n inclusive for n > 3, the program ensures that the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

The program's output matches the expected output provided in the problem description, and it correctly handles the different cases for n. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
