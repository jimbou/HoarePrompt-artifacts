Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM suffix. The program handles all possible hour values from 00 to 23 and correctly determines whether the time is AM or PM. The use of if-elif-else statements to handle each hour value may seem cumbersome, but it is a straightforward and effective way to solve the problem.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as 00:00 being 12:00 AM and 12:00 being 12:00 PM.

The output of the program matches the expected output for the given example input, and the program should produce the correct output for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**
