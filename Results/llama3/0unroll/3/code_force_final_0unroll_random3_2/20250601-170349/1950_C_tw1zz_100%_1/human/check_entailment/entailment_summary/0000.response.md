Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM suffix. It handles all possible hour values from 00 to 23, converting them to the corresponding 12-hour format with the correct AM/PM designation. The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as 00:00 being converted to 12:00 AM and 12:00 being converted to 12:00 PM.

Correctness: **True**
