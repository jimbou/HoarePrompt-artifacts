Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input hour is '12' correctly. According to the problem description, '12' should be converted to '12' in 12-hour format, but the program converts it to '12' in 24-hour format. 

For example, if the input is '12:00', the program will output '12:00 PM', which is correct. However, if the input is '12:01', the program will also output '12:01 PM', which is incorrect. The correct output should be '12:01 PM' for '12:01' in 24-hour format, but the program does not handle this case correctly.

A correct implementation would be to use a more general approach to convert the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, rather than using a long chain of if-elif statements. For example:

```
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h = int(h)
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            time = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            time = 'AM'
        print(f'{h}:{m} {time}')
```

This implementation correctly handles all cases, including the case when the input hour is '12'.
