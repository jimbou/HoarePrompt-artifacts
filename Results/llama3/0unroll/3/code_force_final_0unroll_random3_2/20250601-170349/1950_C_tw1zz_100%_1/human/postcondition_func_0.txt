This function reads a series of times in 24-hour format from standard input, converts each time to 12-hour format with AM/PM suffix, and prints the converted times. It processes multiple lines of input, where the first line specifies the number of times to follow, and each subsequent line contains a time in the format hh:mm. The function handles all possible hour values from 00 to 23, converting them to the corresponding 12-hour format with the correct AM/PM designation.
