Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert a 24-hour time format to a 12-hour time format with AM/PM suffix. The program iterates over each test case, splits the input time into hours and minutes, and then determines the equivalent 12-hour time based on the hour value.

The program uses a series of if-elif statements to handle each possible hour value from '00' to '23'. For hours '01' to '11', it sets the time to 'AM', and for hours '12' to '23', it sets the time to 'PM'. For hours '13' to '23', it also adjusts the hour value to the corresponding 12-hour value (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.).

The program then prints the converted time in the format 'hh:mm AM' or 'hh:mm PM'.

Based on the provided execution states, the program correctly converts each input time to its equivalent 12-hour time format with AM/PM suffix.

Correctness: **True**
