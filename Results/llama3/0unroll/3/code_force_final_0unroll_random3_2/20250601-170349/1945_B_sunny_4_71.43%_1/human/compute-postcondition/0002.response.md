Functionality: **This function reads a series of input sets from standard input, where each set contains three integers: a, b, and m. For each set, it calculates the ceiling division of m by a and m by b, adds these two results together, and prints the sum. The function repeats this process for a specified number of sets, t, which is also read from standard input.**
