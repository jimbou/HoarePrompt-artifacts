Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time by dividing the time the firework is visible in the sky (m) by the frequency of launching for each installation (a and b), adding 1 to account for the ceiling division, and then summing the results.

The program correctly handles the case where the firework is visible for a fraction of a minute, as it uses integer division (//) to calculate the number of whole minutes the firework is visible, and then adds 1 to account for the remaining fraction of a minute.

The program also correctly handles the case where the frequency of launching for one or both installations is greater than the time the firework is visible in the sky, as it will simply calculate the number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time as 1 or 2, depending on the relative values of a, b, and m.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
