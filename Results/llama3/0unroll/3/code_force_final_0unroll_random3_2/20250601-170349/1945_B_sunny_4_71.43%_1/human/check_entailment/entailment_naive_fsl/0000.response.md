Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The program uses the formula `A = int(m / a) + 1` to calculate the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that can be seen in the sky at the same time, and `B = int(m / b) + 1` to calculate the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The program then adds `A` and `B` to get the total number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program correctly handles the case where `m` is not a multiple of `a` or `b`, because the `int(m / a)` and `int(m / b)` expressions truncate the result to the nearest integer, effectively rounding down to the nearest whole number. This ensures that the program does not overcount the number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

The program also correctly handles the case where `a` or `b` is 1, because in this case the `int(m / a)` or `int(m / b)` expression will evaluate to `m`, and the `+ 1` will add 1 to the result, correctly counting the firework that is launched at time 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
