Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The program checks the conditions for Sasha to guarantee winning any number of coins, and it correctly outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the input values of k, x, and a.

The program handles the different cases correctly:

* If x < k - 1, Sasha can guarantee winning by betting 1 coin if he wins or loses.
* If x == k - 1, Sasha can guarantee winning by betting 1 coin if he wins, and 2 coins if he loses.
* If x > k - 1, Sasha can guarantee winning by betting an amount that is calculated based on the value of x and k.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when a is less than the required amount to guarantee winning.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
