The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing three integers k, x, and a. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9).**
