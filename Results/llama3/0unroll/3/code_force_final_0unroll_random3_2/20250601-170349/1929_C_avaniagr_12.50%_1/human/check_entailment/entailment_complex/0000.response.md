Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins based on the given conditions.

The program correctly handles the different cases based on the values of `x` and `k`. 

- If `x` is less than `k-1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x+1`. This is because Sasha can afford to lose `x` times and still have enough coins to make a winning bet.

- If `x` is equal to `k-1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x+3`. This is because Sasha needs to have enough coins to make a winning bet after losing `x` times, and also to make a bet that is at least twice the previous bet.

- If `x` is greater than `k-1`, it calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to have to guarantee a win after `x+1` bets. This is done by simulating the betting process, where Sasha loses `x` times and then wins. The program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to this calculated value.

In all cases, the program correctly prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee a win, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
