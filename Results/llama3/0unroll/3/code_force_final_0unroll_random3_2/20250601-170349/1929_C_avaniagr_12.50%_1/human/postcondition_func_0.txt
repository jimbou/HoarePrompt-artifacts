This function determines whether a given set of conditions are met for each of multiple input sets, where each set consists of three integers k, x, and a. It reads the number of input sets t from standard input, followed by t lines, each containing k, x, and a. For each set, it checks if a is greater than or equal to a calculated value based on k and x, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, or 'NO' otherwise. The calculated value depends on the values of k and x, with different formulas applied for different ranges of x relative to k. The function outputs t lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the condition is met for each input set.
