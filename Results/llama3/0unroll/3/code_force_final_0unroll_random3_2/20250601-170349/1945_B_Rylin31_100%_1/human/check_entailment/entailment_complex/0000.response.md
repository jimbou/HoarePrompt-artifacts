Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The given program calculates this by adding the number of fireworks that can be seen from each installation (m // a and m // b) and then adding 2.

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

- The number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation is m // a, because each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes, and the first installation launches fireworks every a minutes. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation at any given time is m // a.

- Similarly, the number of fireworks that can be seen from the second installation is m // b.

- The program then adds 2 to the sum of these two numbers. This is because the problem statement mentions that if one firework was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one minute. This means that at any given time, there can be at most two fireworks visible from each installation that were launched m minutes apart.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

Correctness: **True**
