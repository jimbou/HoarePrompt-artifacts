This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains three integers a, b, and m. For each test case, it calculates and prints the result of the expression m // a + m // b + 2. The function does not modify the input values and does not return any value; it only prints the calculated results for each test case.
