Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the line where the maximum number of fireworks is calculated: `print(m // a + m // b + 2)`. This line assumes that the maximum number of fireworks is always 2 more than the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation that can be seen in the sky at the same time. However, this is not always the case.

For example, consider the input `a = 1, b = 1, m = 1`. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time is 3 (one from each installation and one that is visible for 1 minute). However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
