Output State: The output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of t lines of output, each containing an integer. If the input integer n is 1, the output will be 1. If n is a power of 2, the output will be 2 to the power of the exponent. Otherwise, the output will be 2 to the power of the largest integer less than the base-2 logarithm of n. The value of n_cases will remain unchanged.
