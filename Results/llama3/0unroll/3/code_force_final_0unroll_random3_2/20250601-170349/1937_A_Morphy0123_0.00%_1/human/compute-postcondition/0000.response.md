Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains one integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9) representing the length of the array a.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `n_cases` is assigned the value of the first line of input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The remaining lines still contain integers representing the number of test cases and the length of the array a.
