Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is an integer representing the length of an array. For each test case, it calculates and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given number. If the number is a power of 2, it prints the number itself. If the number is 1, it prints 1. The function processes all test cases and terminates after printing the results.**
