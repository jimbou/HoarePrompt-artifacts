Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the number of undecided transition videos is more than n // 4 - 1. In this case, the program will assign 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transition videos based on the number of 'F's and 'S's in the input, but it does not guarantee that the resulting sequence of transition videos will not have more than ceil(3n/4) videos of the same type in a row.

For example, consider the input:

6
.?F???
?.???
??.???
???.???
????.???
?????.?

In this case, the program will assign 'F' to the undecided transition videos in the first row, resulting in the sequence:

.FFFFF

However, this sequence has 5 'F's in a row, which is more than ceil(3*6/4) = 4. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.

Note that the program may work correctly for some inputs, but it is not guaranteed to work correctly for all inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
