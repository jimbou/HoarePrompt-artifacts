Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts n+1 inputs, where n is an integer between 2 and 24, and the next n inputs are strings of length n containing characters '.', 'F', 'S', or '?'. The function then analyzes the input strings, identifies patterns, and prints the updated strings with '?' characters replaced based on the identified patterns. The function performs the following actions:**

*   Reads n+1 inputs from stdin.
*   Processes the input strings to identify patterns.
*   Replaces '?' characters in the input strings based on the identified patterns.
*   Prints the updated strings to stdout.

**The function does not return any value; it only prints output to stdout.**
