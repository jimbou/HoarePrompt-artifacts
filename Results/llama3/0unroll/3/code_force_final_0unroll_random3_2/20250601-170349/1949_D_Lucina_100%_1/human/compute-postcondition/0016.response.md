Postcondition: ***The output state is updated based on the comparison of the lengths of lists sa and sb. If the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb, the value of nx is updated to contain the string of characters that are not '?' in the corresponding row of the 2D list xx, and 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions in the loop, and the values of i and j are updated to n + 1. The values of sa, sb, n, a, b, xx, stdin, and t remain unchanged. If the length of sa is less than the length of sb, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception that sb now contains the indices of the list b where the value is greater than 0 and the corresponding value in list a is 0, as well as the indices where both a and b are 0.***
