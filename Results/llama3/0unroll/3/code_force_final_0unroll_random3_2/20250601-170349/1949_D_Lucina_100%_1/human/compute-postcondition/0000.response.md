Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 24 (inclusive), a is a list of n+1 zeros, b is a list of n+1 zeros, xx is a list containing an empty string, stdin contains n inputs: strings of length n, each string containing characters '.', 'F', 'S', or '?'**.

The code snippet reads an integer n from stdin and assigns it to the variable n. It then initializes two lists, a and b, each containing n+1 zeros. Additionally, it creates a list xx containing a single empty string. The remaining n inputs in stdin are strings of length n, each containing characters '.', 'F', 'S', or '?'. The number of 'F' and 'S' characters in all strings is at most n/2 (rounded down). The i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j.
