You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (2 <= n <= 24), and the next n inputs are strings of length n, each string containing characters '.', 'F', 'S', or '?'.

    #State: *The output state is updated based on the comparison of the lengths of lists sa and sb. If the length of sa is greater than or equal to the length of sb, the value of nx is updated to contain the string of characters that are not '?' in the corresponding row of the 2D list xx, and 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions in the loop, and the values of i and j are updated to n + 1.
