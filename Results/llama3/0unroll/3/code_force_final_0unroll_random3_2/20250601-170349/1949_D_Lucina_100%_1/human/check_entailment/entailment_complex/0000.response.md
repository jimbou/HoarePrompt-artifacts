Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly reads the input from stdin, processes it, and prints the output to stdout. It handles the different cases based on the lengths of lists sa and sb, and replaces the '?' characters in the input strings with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions in the loop. 

The program also ensures that the i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j, as required by the problem description. 

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. 

Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
