Precondition: **stdin contains n+1 inputs: the first input is an integer n (2 <= n <= 24), and the next n inputs are strings of length n, each string containing characters '.', 'F', 'S', or '?'. The number of 'F' and 'S' characters in all strings is at most n/2 (rounded down). The i-th character of the j-th string and the j-th character of the i-th string are the same for all i and j.**
