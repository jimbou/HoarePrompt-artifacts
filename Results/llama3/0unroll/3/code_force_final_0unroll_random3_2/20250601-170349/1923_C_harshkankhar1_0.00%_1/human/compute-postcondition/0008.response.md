Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer n, an integer q, and a list of n integers. It calculates the cumulative sums of the input list and another list where each element is either 1 or 2 based on the corresponding element in the input list. It then prints the cumulative sums of the input list. After that, it reads q queries, each consisting of two integers x and y, and for each query, it checks if the cumulative sum of the input list from index x to y is less than the cumulative sum of the other list from index x to y. If so, it prints 'NO', otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function repeats this process until all test cases are processed.**
