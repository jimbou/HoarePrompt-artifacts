Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the subarray has only one element. In this case, the program will print 'NO' because it checks if `x == y` and prints 'NO' if true. However, according to the problem description, a subarray with only one element can be good if the element is greater than 1. 

For example, if the input is:

1
1 1
2
1 1

The program will print 'NO', but the correct answer is 'YES' because the subarray [2] is good.

The program should be modified to handle this edge case correctly.
