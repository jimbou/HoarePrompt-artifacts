Output State: **The number of test cases has been reduced by 1, n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of n+1 positive integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are the input integers, b is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the number of test cases has been reduced by 1 because one test case has been processed. The variable n now holds the value of the first input integer, which is a positive integer. The variable q also holds the value of the second input integer, which is a positive integer. The list a now contains n+1 positive integers, where the first element is 0 and the rest are the input integers. The list b is a list of n+1 zeros. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been processed.
