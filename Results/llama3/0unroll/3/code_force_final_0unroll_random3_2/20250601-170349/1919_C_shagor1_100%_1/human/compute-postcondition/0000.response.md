The code snippet is simply `pass`, which means it does nothing and does not affect the state of the program. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).**
