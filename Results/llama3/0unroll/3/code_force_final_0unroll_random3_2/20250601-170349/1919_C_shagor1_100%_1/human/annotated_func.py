#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n).
    pass

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It processes each test case and produces output based on the input values.
