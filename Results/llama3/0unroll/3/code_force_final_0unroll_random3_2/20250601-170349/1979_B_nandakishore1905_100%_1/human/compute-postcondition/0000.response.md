Output State: **The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the two input integers. If the absolute difference is a power of 2, it will be printed as is. If the absolute difference is odd, 1 will be printed. Otherwise, the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the absolute difference will be printed.**
