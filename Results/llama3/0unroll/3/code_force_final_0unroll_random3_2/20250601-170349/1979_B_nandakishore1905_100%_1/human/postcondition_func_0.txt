The function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two distinct non-negative integers. It calculates the absolute difference between these integers, and then prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to this difference. If the difference is a power of 2, it prints the difference as is. If the difference is odd, it prints 1. The function repeats this process for each test case, producing a series of integers as output.
