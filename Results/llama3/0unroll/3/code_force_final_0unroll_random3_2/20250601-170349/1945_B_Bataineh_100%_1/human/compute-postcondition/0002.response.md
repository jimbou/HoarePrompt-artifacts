Functionality: **This function reads a series of input values from standard input, where each set of values consists of three integers: a, b, and m. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make a and b equal to m, considering all possible cases where m is less than, greater than, or equal to a and b. The function processes multiple sets of input values, as specified by an initial integer t, and outputs the calculated minimum operations for each set.**
