You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(input())
        
        res = [0] * n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
        
        res[0] = ans % m % MOD
        
        c = 1
        
        l = 0
        
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
                res[c] = ans % m % MOD
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is as follows: The value of `MOD` remains unchanged at 1000000006. The value of `t` has been consumed and is no longer available. The loop has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has calculated and printed the `res` array. The `res` array contains the result of the calculation for each test case, which is the product of the elements in the `arr` array, taken modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`, for each position in the array. The `ans` variable has been updated and used to calculate the `res` array for each test case. The `c`, `l`, and `r` variables have been used to keep track of the current position in the `arr` and `s` arrays, and have been updated accordingly. The `s` array has been consumed and is no longer available. The `arr` array has been consumed and is no longer available. The `n` and `m` variables have been consumed and are no longer available. The `res` array has been printed for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
