Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. The program uses a variable `MOD` to avoid overflow when calculating the product of the array elements. It also uses variables `l` and `r` to keep track of the current position in the array when removing elements from the left or right.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the product of all elements in the array at the beginning and then updates the product by removing elements. But it does not correctly handle the case when the product becomes zero. When the product becomes zero, removing any element will not change the product, but the program still updates the product as if the removed element was not zero.

Correctness: **False**
