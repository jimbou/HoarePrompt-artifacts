This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It takes no arguments and returns no value. For each test case, it reads two integers (n and m) and an array of n integers, followed by a string of n characters ('L' or 'R'). It calculates the product of the array elements modulo m and MOD (10^9 + 6), and then updates the product by removing elements from the left or right based on the characters in the string. The final product values are stored in an array and printed for each test case.
