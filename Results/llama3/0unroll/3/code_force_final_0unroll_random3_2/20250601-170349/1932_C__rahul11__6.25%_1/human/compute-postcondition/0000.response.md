Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000006, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and the third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of MOD is set to 1000000006, and the input remains the same as in the initial state, waiting for further processing.
