Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, flag is False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not equal, otherwise flag is True, ans is Infinity, val is the first element of arr, cnt is 0**

In this output state, the values of `stdin`, `n`, `arr`, and `flag` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces two new variables, `ans` and `val`, and assigns them the values of `Infinity` and the first element of `arr`, respectively. Additionally, a new variable `cnt` is introduced and initialized to 0.
