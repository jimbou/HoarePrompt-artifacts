Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the array contains only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the array [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. The program will return 1, but the correct answer is 2, because we need to remove at least two elements to make the array not beautiful.

The problem with the program is that it only checks for the minimum count of consecutive elements, but it does not consider the case when the elements are alternating. The program should also check for the minimum count of alternating elements.

Here is an example of how the program can be corrected:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        val1, val2 = arr[0], arr[1]
        cnt1, cnt2 = 0, 0
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == val1:
                cnt1 += 1
            elif arr[i] == val2:
                cnt2 += 1
        print(min(cnt1, cnt2))
```

This corrected program first checks if the array contains only one distinct element. If it does, it prints -1. Otherwise, it finds the two distinct elements and counts their occurrences. The minimum count is the answer.
