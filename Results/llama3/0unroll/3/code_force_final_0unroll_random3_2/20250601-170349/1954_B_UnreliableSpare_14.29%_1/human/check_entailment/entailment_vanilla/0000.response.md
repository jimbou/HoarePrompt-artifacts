Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

3. It then checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.

4. If the array contains different elements, it initializes a variable `ans` to infinity and a tuple `(val, cnt)` to `(arr[0], 0)`. The variable `ans` is used to store the minimum count of consecutive elements that need to be removed, and the tuple `(val, cnt)` is used to keep track of the current value and its count.

5. The program then iterates over the array. If the current element is the same as the current value `val`, it increments the count `cnt`. If the current element is different, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and then updates `(val, cnt)` to `(arr[i], 1)`.

6. After the loop, it updates `ans` one more time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` because the last sequence of consecutive elements is not handled in the loop.

7. Finally, it prints `ans` as the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
