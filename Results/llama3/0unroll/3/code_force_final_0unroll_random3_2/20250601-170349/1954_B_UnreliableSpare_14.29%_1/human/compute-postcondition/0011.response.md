Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` is the minimum between the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in `arr` and the total number of occurrences of the first element in `arr`. The value of `cnt` is the total number of occurrences of the first element in `arr`. The value of `flag` is false.

When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum between the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in `arr` and the total number of occurrences of the first element in `arr`.

Output: **the minimum between the previous minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in arr and the total number of occurrences of the first element in arr**
