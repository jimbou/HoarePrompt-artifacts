Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if all elements in the array are equal. If they are, it prints -1, as it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. If not all elements are equal, it finds the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive occurrences of the first element.

3. The program uses the `Decimal` class to initialize `ans` to infinity, which is a good practice to avoid potential integer overflow issues.

4. The program correctly updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element.

5. Finally, the program prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
