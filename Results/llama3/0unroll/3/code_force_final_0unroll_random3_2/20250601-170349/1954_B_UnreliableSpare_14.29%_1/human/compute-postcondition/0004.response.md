Output State: The loop iterates over the list 'arr' and updates the variables 'ans', 'cnt', and 'val' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. After the loop finishes executing, the output state is as follows:

- 'ans' is updated to be the minimum value between its initial value (Infinity) and the count of consecutive occurrences of the value 'val' in the list 'arr'. If there are no consecutive occurrences of 'val', 'ans' remains Infinity.
- 'cnt' is the count of consecutive occurrences of the value 'val' in the list 'arr'. If 'val' does not appear consecutively in 'arr', 'cnt' is 0.
- 'val' remains the same as its initial value, which is the first element of the list 'arr'.

The other variables 't', 'n', 'arr', and 'flag' remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
