Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and n, flag is True**

In this output state, the code has read the first test case from stdin, which consists of an integer n and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The value of n is stored in the variable n, and the list of integers is stored in the variable arr. The variable flag is set to True. The remaining t-1 test cases are still in stdin, waiting to be read.
