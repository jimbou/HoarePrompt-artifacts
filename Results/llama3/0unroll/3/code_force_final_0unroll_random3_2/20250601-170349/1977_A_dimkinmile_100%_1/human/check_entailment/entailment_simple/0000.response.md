Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program uses the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` to check if it's possible to build the tower. This condition is based on the fact that the difference between the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m) must be even and non-negative.

The reasoning behind this condition is as follows:

* If the difference between n and m is even, it means that the number of cubes added and removed can be paired up, resulting in a net addition or removal of an even number of cubes. This is possible only if the number of moves is even.
* If the difference between n and m is non-negative, it means that the number of cubes added is greater than or equal to the number of cubes removed. This is a necessary condition to build a tower with m cubes.

The program correctly prints 'Yes' if the condition is met and 'No' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
