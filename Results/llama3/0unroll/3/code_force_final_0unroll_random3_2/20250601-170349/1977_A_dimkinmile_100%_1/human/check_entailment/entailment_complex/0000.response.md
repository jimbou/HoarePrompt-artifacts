Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower.

The program uses a simple yet effective approach. It checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. This is because the number of moves `n` must be sufficient to add or remove cubes to reach the desired height `m`. If the difference is even, it means that the number of moves can be divided into pairs of add and remove operations, which would result in a net change of 0 or 2 cubes. If the difference is non-negative, it means that the number of moves is sufficient to add or remove cubes to reach the desired height.

The program correctly implements this logic using the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)`. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, I conclude that the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
