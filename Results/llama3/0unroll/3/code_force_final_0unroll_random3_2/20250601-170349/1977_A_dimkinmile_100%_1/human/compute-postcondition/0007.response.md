Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). If the difference between `n` and `m` is even and greater than or equal to 0, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
