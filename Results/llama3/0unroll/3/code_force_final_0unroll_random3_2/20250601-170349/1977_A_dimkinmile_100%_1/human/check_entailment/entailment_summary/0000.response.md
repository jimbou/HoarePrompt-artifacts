Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The given program checks if the difference between n and m is even and non-negative. This condition is necessary and sufficient to determine if it's possible to build the tower.

Here's why:

* If the difference between n and m is even, it means that the number of moves (n) is either equal to the number of cubes (m) or can be divided into pairs of moves that add and remove a cube, effectively canceling each other out. This leaves the remaining moves to add the required number of cubes.
* If the difference between n and m is non-negative, it means that the number of moves (n) is greater than or equal to the number of cubes (m). This ensures that there are enough moves to add the required number of cubes.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints 'Yes' if the condition is met, otherwise prints 'No'.

Correctness: **True**
