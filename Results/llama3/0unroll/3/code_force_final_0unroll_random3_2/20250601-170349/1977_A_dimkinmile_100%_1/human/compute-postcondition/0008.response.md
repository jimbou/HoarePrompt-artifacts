Functionality: **This function reads two integers `n` and `m` from standard input, checks if their difference is even and non-negative, and prints 'Yes' if the condition is met, otherwise prints 'No'. The function modifies the state of the standard input by consuming the two integers, leaving the remaining input unchanged.**
