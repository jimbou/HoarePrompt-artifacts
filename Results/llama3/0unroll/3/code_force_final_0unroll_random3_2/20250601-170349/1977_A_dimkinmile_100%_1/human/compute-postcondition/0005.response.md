Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'No'.

The variables `n` and `m` are integers, and the precondition states that either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`. However, the print statement is not dependent on the values of `n` and `m`. It simply prints the string 'No' regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
