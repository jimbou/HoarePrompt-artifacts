Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even and non-negative. This is because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, so the number of cubes must be within the range of the number of moves. If the difference is even, it means that Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs, resulting in an even number of cubes. If the difference is non-negative, it means that Nikita has enough moves to add or remove the required number of cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when n and m are equal, when n is greater than m, and when n is less than m. It also correctly handles edge cases, such as when n or m is 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
