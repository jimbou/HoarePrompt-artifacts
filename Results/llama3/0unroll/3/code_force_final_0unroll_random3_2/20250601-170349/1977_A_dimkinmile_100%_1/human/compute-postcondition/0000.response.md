Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers, 1 <= n, m <= 100, stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to be integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state. The stdin now contains one less line, as one line has been read to assign values to `n` and `m`. The remaining lines in stdin still contain two integers each, with the same range of values.
