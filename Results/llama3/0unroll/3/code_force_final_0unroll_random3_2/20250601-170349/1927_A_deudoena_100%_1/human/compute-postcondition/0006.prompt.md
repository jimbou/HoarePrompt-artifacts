You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases), then for each test case, first an integer (the length of the strip) and then a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: Output State: m is an integer, s is a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, ma is 0, mi is the position of the first 'B' character in s, c is the position of the first 'B' character in s, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer (the length of the strip) and then a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: Output State: m is an integer, s is a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, ma is the position of the last 'B' character in s, mi is the position of the first 'B' character in s, c is the position of the first 'B' character in s, d is the position of the last 'B' character in s plus one, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer (the length of the strip) and then a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' character and the position of the first 'B' character in string s, plus 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' character and the position of the first 'B' character in string s, plus 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
