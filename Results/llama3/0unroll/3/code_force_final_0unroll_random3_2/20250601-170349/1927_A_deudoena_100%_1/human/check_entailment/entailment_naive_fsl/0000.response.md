Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string contains only one 'B' character. In this case, the function should return 1, but the program returns 2. This is because the program adds 2 to the difference between the indices of the first and last 'B' characters, which is not necessary when there is only one 'B' character.

For example, if the input is:

1
B

The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1.
