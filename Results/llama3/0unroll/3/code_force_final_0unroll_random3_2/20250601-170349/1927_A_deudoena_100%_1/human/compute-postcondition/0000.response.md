Output State: **m is an integer, s is a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, ma is 0, mi is 0, c is 0, d is 0, l is an empty list, stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer (the length of the strip) and then a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code has executed, and the output state reflects the changes made to the variables. The variable `m` now holds an integer value, which is the number of test cases. The variable `s` holds a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, which is the input for the first test case. The variables `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0 and remain unchanged. The variables `c` and `d` are also initialized to 0 and remain unchanged. The variable `l` is an empty list. The stdin still contains multiple inputs for each test case, consisting of an integer (the length of the strip) and a string consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters.
