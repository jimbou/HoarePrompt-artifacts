Output State: `__name__` is `'__main__'`, `t` is `0`, stdin contains no test cases.

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The value of `t` has been decremented to `0` after each iteration, and the stdin contains no more test cases. The other variables in the precondition, `__name__`, remain unchanged.
