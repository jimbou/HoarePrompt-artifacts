Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into a regular polygon with n sides. The given program simply prints the value of x minus 2 for each test case, where x is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

The key insight here is that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed is indeed x - 2. This is because each pair of vertices can form a diagonal, and each diagonal can be used to form a triangle with a third vertex. Since there are x vertices, there are x - 2 pairs of vertices that can form diagonals, and hence x - 2 triangles can be formed.

The program correctly implements this insight by simply printing the value of x minus 2 for each test case. The execution summary confirms that the program reads the input correctly and prints the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
