Reasoning:

The problem statement requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices. The given program simply prints `x - 2`, where `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen.

The key insight here is that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake is equal to the number of vertices minus 2. This is because each triangle requires 3 vertices, and each vertex can be part of at most 2 triangles. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is `x - 2`.

The program correctly implements this insight by simply printing `x - 2` for each test case. The input values of `n` and `y` are not used in the program, but this is correct because the problem statement specifies that `y = 0` and the maximum number of triangles only depends on the number of chosen vertices `x`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
