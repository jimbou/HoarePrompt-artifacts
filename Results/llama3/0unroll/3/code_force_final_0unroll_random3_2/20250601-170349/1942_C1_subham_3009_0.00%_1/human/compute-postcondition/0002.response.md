Output State: `__name__` is `'__main__'`, `t` is `0`, stdin contains no test cases, and the output of the program is the sum of `x - 2` for each test case.

In natural language, the output state is that the program has finished executing all test cases, and the value of `t` has been decremented to `0`. The standard input (stdin) is empty, and the program has printed the sum of `x - 2` for each test case. The value of `__name__` remains unchanged as `'__main__'`.
