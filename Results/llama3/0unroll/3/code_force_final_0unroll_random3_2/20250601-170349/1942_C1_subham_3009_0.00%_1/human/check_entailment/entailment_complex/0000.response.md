Reasoning:

The problem statement asks to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained by choosing no more than y other vertices, given that Bessie has already chosen x vertices. However, in this version of the problem, y is always 0, which means no additional vertices can be chosen.

The given program simply prints x - 2 for each test case, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be obtained using only the x vertices already chosen by Bessie. This is because each pair of vertices can form a diagonal, and each diagonal can be used to create a triangle with a third vertex. Since there are x vertices, there are x-2 pairs of vertices that can be used to form diagonals, and therefore x-2 triangles can be created.

Since the program correctly calculates and prints the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case, and there are no additional vertices that can be chosen (y = 0), the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
