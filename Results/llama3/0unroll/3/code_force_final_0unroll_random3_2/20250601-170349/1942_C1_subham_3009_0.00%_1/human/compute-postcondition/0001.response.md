Output State: **`__name__` is `'__main__'`, `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to the minimum of n and 2 * 10^5, and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, because one test case has been read to determine the value of `t`. The rest of the test cases remain in the stdin, each consisting of two lines with the specified conditions.
