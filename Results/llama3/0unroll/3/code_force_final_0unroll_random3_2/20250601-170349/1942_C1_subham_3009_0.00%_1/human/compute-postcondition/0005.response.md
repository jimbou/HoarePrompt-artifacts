Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then prints the value of x minus 2 for each test case. The function continues to read and process test cases until there are no more cases in the standard input.**
