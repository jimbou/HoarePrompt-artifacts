#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and m, and then a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. 1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no input parameters and returns 0, effectively terminating the program without performing any actions or modifying any input variables.
