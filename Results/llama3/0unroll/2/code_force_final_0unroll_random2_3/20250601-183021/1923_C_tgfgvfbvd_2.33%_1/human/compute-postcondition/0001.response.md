Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of two integers, and a list of integers, followed by a list of queries. For each query, it calculates the sum of a subarray within the list of integers and checks if it is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. The function then prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise, for each query in the order they were processed.**
