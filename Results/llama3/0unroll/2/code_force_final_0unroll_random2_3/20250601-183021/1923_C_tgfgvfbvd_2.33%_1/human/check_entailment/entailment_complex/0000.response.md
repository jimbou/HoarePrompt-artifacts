Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the prefix sum of the array `c`, which allows it to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

2. For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray from index `a` to `b` by subtracting the prefix sum at index `a-2` from the prefix sum at index `b-1`. This is correct because the prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to and including index `i`.

3. It then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is the condition for a subarray to be good according to the problem description.

4. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when `a` is 1 (in which case it doesn't subtract the prefix sum at index `a-2` because it's out of bounds).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
