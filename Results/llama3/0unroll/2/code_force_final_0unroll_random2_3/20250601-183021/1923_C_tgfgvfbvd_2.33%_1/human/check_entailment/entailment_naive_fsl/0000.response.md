Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not. It calculates the prefix sum of the array `c` and then for each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray by subtracting the prefix sum at the start index from the prefix sum at the end index. It then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the start index is 1 (in which case it doesn't subtract the prefix sum at the start index), and when the length of the subarray is 1 (in which case it prints 'NO' because a single element cannot be rearranged to satisfy the conditions).

The program also handles the case when the sum of the subarray is exactly equal to twice the length of the subarray, in which case it prints 'YES' because it is possible to rearrange the elements to satisfy the conditions.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not, and it handles all edge cases correctly.
