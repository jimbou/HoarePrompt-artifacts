Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.

2. It then reads the array `l` of length `n` and calculates the prefix sum array `p`. The prefix sum array is used to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.

3. For each query, it reads the start index `a` and the end index `b` of the subarray. It then calculates the sum of the subarray using the prefix sum array.

4. The program then checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately implements the conditions for a subarray to be good. The use of the prefix sum array also makes the program efficient, as it allows for the sum of any subarray to be calculated in constant time.

Correctness: **True**
