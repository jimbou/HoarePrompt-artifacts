The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t`. After executing this code, the value of `t` is assigned, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line (the number of test cases) has been consumed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
