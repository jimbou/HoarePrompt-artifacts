Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into by repeatedly applying the median operation. The program iterates over the list of integers, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers and keeping track of the maximum of the minimum of these pairs. This is because the median operation can only increase the value of the array if the minimum of the pair is greater than the current maximum. The program then prints the maximum value found for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
