Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables.
2. It sorts the list of chosen vertices in ascending order, which is necessary for the subsequent steps.
3. The program then iterates over the sorted list and counts the number of pairs of consecutive integers that are one less than the next integer in the list. This is done by checking if the difference between the current integer and the next integer is 1. If it is, it increments the count.
4. After the loop, the program checks if the last integer in the list is one less than the total number of sides of the polygon (n). If it is, it increments the count again.
5. Finally, the program prints the count plus the number of chosen vertices minus 2. This is because each pair of consecutive integers that are one less than the next integer in the list can form a triangle with the vertex at the next integer, and the number of chosen vertices minus 2 represents the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out.

Correctness: **True**
