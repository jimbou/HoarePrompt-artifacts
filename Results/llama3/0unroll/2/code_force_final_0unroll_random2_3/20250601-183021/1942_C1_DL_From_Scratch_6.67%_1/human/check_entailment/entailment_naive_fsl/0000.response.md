Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. It first sorts the list of chosen vertices and then iterates through the list to count the number of triangular pieces that can be formed. The program also correctly handles the case where the last vertex is connected to the first vertex, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

The program's logic is based on the fact that each pair of adjacent vertices can form a triangular piece of cake, and the number of such pairs is equal to the number of vertices minus 2. The program also correctly handles the case where there are only two vertices, in which case no triangular pieces can be formed.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
