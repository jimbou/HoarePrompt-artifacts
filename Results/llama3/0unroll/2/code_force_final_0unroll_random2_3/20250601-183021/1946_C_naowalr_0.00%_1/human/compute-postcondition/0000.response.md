Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`, and the next `n-2` lines of stdin contain two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`) separated by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to a positive integer read from the first line of stdin. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the next `n-2` lines of stdin still contain two integers `a` and `b` separated by a space, with the constraints 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`.
