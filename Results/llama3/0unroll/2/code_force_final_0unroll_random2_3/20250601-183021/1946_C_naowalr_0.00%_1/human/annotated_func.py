#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, and the next n-1 lines of stdin contain two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= n) separated by a space.
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: The value of `L` is printed to the console `t` times, where `L` is the minimum number of cuts required to divide the graph into at least `k` connected components, or the minimum number of cuts required to divide the graph into exactly `k` connected components with a leftover value greater than or equal to `x`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it to determine the minimum number of cuts required to divide a graph into at least k connected components or exactly k connected components with a leftover value greater than or equal to x, and prints the result to the console. It performs this operation t times, where t is a positive integer provided as input. The function does not modify the input values of n, k, a, and b.
