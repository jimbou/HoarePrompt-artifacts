This function reads input from stdin, processes it to determine the minimum number of cuts required to divide a graph into at least k connected components or exactly k connected components with a leftover value greater than or equal to x, and prints the result to the console. It performs this operation t times, where t is a positive integer provided as input. The function does not modify the input values of n, k, a, and b.
