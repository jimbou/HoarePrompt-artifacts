Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.
2.  It sorts the list of integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
3.  It calculates the index `p` of the median value in the sorted list. The formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` is correct because it handles both even and odd lengths of the list.
4.  It counts the frequency of the median value in the sorted list using the `count` method. This is necessary because the problem statement allows the array to contain duplicate numbers.
5.  Finally, it prints the result, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The execution summary confirms that the function processes all test cases and leaves the standard input empty upon completion.

Correctness: **True**
