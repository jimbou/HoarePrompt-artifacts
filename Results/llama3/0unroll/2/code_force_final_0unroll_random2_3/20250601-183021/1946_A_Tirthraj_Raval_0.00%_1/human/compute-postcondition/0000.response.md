Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, t is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input from stdin to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case containing two inputs, the first input is an integer representing the number of test cases. After this line executes, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The value of `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one. No other variables are affected.
