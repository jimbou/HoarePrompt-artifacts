Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the median is the smallest number in the array. In this case, the program will return the count of the median, but it should return the number of elements less than the median plus one.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program will return 5, but the correct answer is 1. This is because we only need to increase one of the elements to increase the median.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to find the number of elements less than the median and add one to it. This will give the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
