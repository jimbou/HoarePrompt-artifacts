Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median of an array. The median is the middle value in a sorted array. If the array has an odd length, the median is the middle value. If the array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle values.

The given program sorts the array and finds the median. It then counts the number of occurrences of the median value in the array. This count is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   1. Read the length of the array `n`.
   2. Read the array `a`.
   3. Sort the array `a` in ascending order.
   4. Calculate the index `p` of the median value. If `n` is odd, `p` is the index of the middle value. If `n` is even, `p` is the index of the lower middle value.
   5. Count the number of occurrences of the median value `a[p]` in the array. This count is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
   6. Print the count.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations to increase the median of an array.

Correctness: **True**
