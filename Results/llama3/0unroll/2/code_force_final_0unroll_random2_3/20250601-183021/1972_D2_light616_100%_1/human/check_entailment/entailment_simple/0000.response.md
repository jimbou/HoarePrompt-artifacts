Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The conditions are:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads two positive integers n and m from stdin, and then uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of x and y such that (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m. For each pair (x, y), it checks if gcd(x, y) is 1, and if so, increments the count of coprime pairs by the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y).

`func_2` reads an integer t from stdin, which represents the number of test cases. It then calls `func_1` t times, reading two positive integers n and m from stdin for each test case.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. The nested loop in `func_1` correctly iterates over all possible values of x and y, and the check for gcd(x, y) == 1 ensures that only coprime pairs are counted. The use of min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) ensures that the count is incremented by the correct amount for each pair.

The only potential issue with the program is that it does not handle the case where n or m is 0. However, the problem statement guarantees that n and m are positive integers, so this is not a concern.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
