Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The conditions are:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of coprime pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, given two positive integers n and m as input. `func_2` reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t pairs of positive integers n and m, and calls `func_1` t times.

The key to the correctness of the program lies in the implementation of `func_1`. The function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible values of x and y, where x is the smallest integer greater than the square root of n, and y is 1. For each pair (x, y), it checks if the greatest common divisor of x and y is 1 (i.e., they are coprime). If they are coprime, it increments the count of valid pairs by the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y).

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the following aspects:

1.  The loop in `func_1` correctly iterates over all possible values of x and y.
2.  The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` correctly checks if x and y are coprime.
3.  The increment of the count by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for each coprime pair (x, y).
4.  `func_2` correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` the required number of times.

Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
