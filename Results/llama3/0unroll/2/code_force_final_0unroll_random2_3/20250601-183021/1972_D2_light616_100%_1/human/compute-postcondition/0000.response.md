The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). So `t` is assigned the value of this integer and stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**
