Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the mathematical formula to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The formula is based on the fact that b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b if and only if (a, b) is a multiple of (x, y) where x and y are coprime and x + y divides both a and b.

The program iterates over all possible values of x and y, and for each pair (x, y), it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) that are multiples of (x, y) and satisfy the conditions. The program uses the math.gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor of x and y, and the min function to calculate the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y), which represents the number of pairs (a, b) that are multiples of (x, y) and satisfy the conditions.

The program also correctly handles the case where x = y = 1, which is a special case because gcd(1, 1) = 1.

The program's time complexity is O(sqrt(n) * sqrt(m)), which is efficient enough to handle the given constraints.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it accurately solves the problem.
