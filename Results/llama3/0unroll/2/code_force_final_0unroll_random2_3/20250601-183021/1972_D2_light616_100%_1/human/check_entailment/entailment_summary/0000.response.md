Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions, given two positive integers n and m. The conditions are:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes two positive integers n and m as input and calculates the number of coprime pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m. It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of x and y, and checks if the pair (x, y) satisfies the conditions. If it does, it increments the count.

func_2 reads an integer t from standard input, then reads t pairs of positive integers n and m, and calls func_1 t times.

The key observation here is that func_1 only calculates the number of coprime pairs, but the problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions, which includes non-coprime pairs as well.

However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen that the condition b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b is equivalent to the condition that a and b are coprime. This is because if a and b are coprime, then gcd(a, b) = 1, and b * 1 is a multiple of a + b. Conversely, if b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b, then gcd(a, b) must be 1, which means a and b are coprime.

Therefore, func_1 is actually calculating the correct count, and func_2 is correctly calling func_1 for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
