Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It first initializes three lists to store the constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and type 3 (k must be not equal to x). It then iterates over the constraints, updating the lists accordingly.

After processing all constraints, it calculates the range of possible values for k by subtracting the maximum value of type 1 constraints from the minimum value of type 2 constraints and adding 1. If this range is less than 1, it prints 0, indicating that there are no possible values for k.

Otherwise, it iterates over the type 3 constraints and subtracts 1 from the range for each constraint that falls within the range. This is because each type 3 constraint eliminates one possible value for k.

Finally, it prints the updated range, which represents the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the range of possible values for k is empty (i.e., num < 1) or where there are no type 3 constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
