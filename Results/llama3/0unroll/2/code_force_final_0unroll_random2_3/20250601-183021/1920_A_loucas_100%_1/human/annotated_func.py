#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x.
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: The loop will execute 'loop' number of times. In each iteration, it will read 'innerLoop' number of lines from the standard input, where each line contains two integers 'x' and 'a'. The loop will then calculate the number of possible values for 'k' based on the constraints provided in the input lines. If the number of possible values is less than 1, it will print 0. Otherwise, it will print the number of possible values. The loop will continue this process until it has executed 'loop' number of times.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then calculates the number of possible values for k based on the constraints provided in the input lines, where k must be greater than or equal to x if a=1, less than or equal to x if a=2, and not equal to x if a=3. If the number of possible values is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the number of possible values. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.
