You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x.
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: The loop will execute 'loop' number of times. In each iteration, it will read 'innerLoop' number of lines from the standard input, where each line contains two integers 'x' and 'a'. The loop will then calculate the number of possible values for 'k' based on the constraints provided in the input lines. If the number of possible values is less than 1, it will print 0. Otherwise, it will print the number of possible values. The loop will continue this process until it has executed 'loop' number of times.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
