Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with n-1 lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). a denotes the type of constraint. If a=1, k must be greater than or equal to x. If a=2, k must be less than or equal to x. If a=3, k must be not equal to x.**

In this output state, the value of `loop` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The stdin now contains multiple test cases, each starting with n-1 lines, where n is the value of `loop`. Each line contains two integers a and x, where a is in {1,2,3} and x is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The type of constraint denoted by a remains the same as in the initial state.
