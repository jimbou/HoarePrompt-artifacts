This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then calculates the number of possible values for k based on the constraints provided in the input lines, where k must be greater than or equal to x if a=1, less than or equal to x if a=2, and not equal to x if a=3. If the number of possible values is less than 1, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the number of possible values. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.
