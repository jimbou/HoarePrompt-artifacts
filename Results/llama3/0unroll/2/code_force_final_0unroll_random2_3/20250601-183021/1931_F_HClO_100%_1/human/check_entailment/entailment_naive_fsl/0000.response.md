Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, when the number of screenshots (m) is greater than 2, the program only checks if the first two screenshots are consistent with each other, but it does not check if the remaining screenshots are consistent with the first two. This can lead to incorrect results when the remaining screenshots are not consistent with the first two.

For instance, consider the following input:

5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 1 4 5
3 1 2 4 5

The program will output "yes" because the first two screenshots are consistent with each other, but the third screenshot is not consistent with the first two. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should check all screenshots for consistency, not just the first two.
