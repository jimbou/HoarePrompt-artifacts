Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers. n and k are positive integers, and the sum of n * k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, but one integer is removed from the stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases, but with one integer removed. The remaining test cases still have two integers n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers, where n and k are positive integers, and the sum of n * k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
