Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly handles various cases, including when k is 1, when the first two lines have different elements, and when the input data can be rearranged to match a specific pattern. 

The program also correctly checks if the input data can be rearranged to form a specific pattern, and prints 'yes' if possible, 'no' otherwise. 

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. 

Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is True.

Correctness: **True**
