Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers. It then checks if the input data can be rearranged to form a specific pattern, and prints 'yes' if possible, 'no' otherwise. The function handles various cases, including when k is 1, when the first two lines have different elements, and when the input data can be rearranged to match a specific pattern.**
