Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on the size of a set of integers. It takes as input a list of integers and outputs a string indicating whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins. The function iterates over multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers, and outputs a list of strings, one for each test case, indicating the winner. The winner is determined by the minimum excluded size (mexsize) of the set, which is the smallest positive integer not present in the set. If mexsize is greater than the maximum size of the set, the winner is determined by the parity of mexsize; otherwise, the winner is determined by the parity of mexsize minus one.**
