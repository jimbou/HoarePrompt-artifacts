Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way it calculates the `mexsize` variable. The `mexsize` is supposed to be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array `a`. However, the program increments `mexsize` only when it finds a matching element in the sorted array `a`, which is not the correct way to calculate the `mexsize`.

For example, consider the input `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. The `mexsize` should be 3, but the program will calculate it as 2 because it only increments `mexsize` when it finds a matching element in the array.

A correct approach would be to use a separate data structure, such as a set, to keep track of the elements present in the array, and then find the smallest positive integer that is not present in the set.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        mexsize = 1
        present = set(a)
        while mexsize in present:
            mexsize += 1
        if mexsize > max(a):
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
```
This corrected program uses a set `present` to keep track of the elements present in the array, and then finds the smallest positive integer `mexsize` that is not present in the set.
