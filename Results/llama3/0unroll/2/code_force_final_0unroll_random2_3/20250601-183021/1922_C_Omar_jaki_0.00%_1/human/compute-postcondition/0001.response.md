Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of integers representing the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the input list, followed by the string 'B'. The list is then used to calculate and print the sum of differences between specific pairs of elements in the list.**

In natural language, the output state represents the result of processing multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements in the input list, and then uses this cumulative sum to calculate and print the sum of differences between specific pairs of elements in the list. The output state includes the cumulative sum list followed by the string 'B', and the results of the pair-wise difference calculations.
