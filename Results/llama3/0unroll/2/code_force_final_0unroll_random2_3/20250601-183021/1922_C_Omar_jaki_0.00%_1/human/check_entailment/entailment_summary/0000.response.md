Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities based on the given conditions. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of cities, the coordinates of the cities, and the queries.
2.  It initializes the `b` list with the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive cities, taking into account the special case where the closest city is the next one.
3.  For each query, it correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between the given cities by subtracting the cumulative sum at the starting city from the cumulative sum at the destination city.
4.  The program handles both forward and backward queries correctly, using the appropriate indices into the `b` list.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
