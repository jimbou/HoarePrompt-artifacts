Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements in the input list and uses this cumulative sum to calculate and print the sum of differences between specific pairs of elements in the list.

The program first reads the input list and calculates the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements. It then reads the pairs of elements and uses the cumulative sum to calculate the sum of differences between each pair of elements. The program handles both cases where the first element of the pair is less than the second element and where the first element is greater than the second element.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the first element of the pair is the first element of the list and where the second element of the pair is the last element of the list.

The use of the bitwise XOR operator (`**`) to calculate the cumulative sum is a clever optimization, as it allows the program to calculate the cumulative sum in a single pass through the list.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
