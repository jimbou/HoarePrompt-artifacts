Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads a list of integers and calculates the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements. It then uses this cumulative sum to calculate and print the sum of differences between specific pairs of elements in the list. The function iterates over all test cases, processing each one independently and printing the results for each pair of elements.**
