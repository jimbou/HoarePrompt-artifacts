Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the number of digits in the list of integers and the number of zeros in every other integer.

The main function `func_1` calculates the total number of digits in the list of integers, subtracts the number of zeros in every other integer (starting from the integer with the most zeros), and compares the result with the input non-negative integer `m` plus one. If the result is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it returns 'Sasha', indicating that Sasha wins. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna', indicating that Anna wins.

The helper function `zerocnts` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given non-negative integer.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, and the logic is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
