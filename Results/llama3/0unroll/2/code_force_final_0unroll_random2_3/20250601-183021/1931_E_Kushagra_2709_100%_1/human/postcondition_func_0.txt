This function determines the winner of a game based on the number of digits in a list of integers and the number of zeros in every other integer. It takes as input a list of positive integers and a non-negative integer, and returns either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' depending on whether the total number of digits minus the number of zeros in every other integer is greater than or equal to the input non-negative integer plus one.
