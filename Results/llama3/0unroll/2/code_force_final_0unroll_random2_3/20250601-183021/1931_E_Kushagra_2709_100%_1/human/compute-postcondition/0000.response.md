Output State: **num is a string representing a non-negative integer, tot is 0**

The code snippet first converts the non-negative integer `num` to a string, effectively changing its data type. The second line initializes a new variable `tot` and assigns it the value 0. Since `num` was a non-negative integer, its string representation will be a sequence of digits. The value of `tot` remains unchanged throughout the code execution, so it stays at 0.
