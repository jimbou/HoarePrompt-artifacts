Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of digits in the list of integers and the number of zeros in every other integer.

The function `func_1` calculates the total number of digits in the list of integers and then subtracts the number of zeros in every other integer. If the result is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it returns 'Sasha', indicating that Sasha wins. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna', indicating that Anna wins.

The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given non-negative integer.

The main program iterates over the test cases, reads the input, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner of each game.

Correctness: **True**
