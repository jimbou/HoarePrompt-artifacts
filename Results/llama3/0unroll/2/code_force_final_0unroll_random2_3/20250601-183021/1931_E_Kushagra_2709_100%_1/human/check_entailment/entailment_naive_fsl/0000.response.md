Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the optimal moves of both players.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `zerocnts`. The `zerocnts` function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a given number, and the `func_1` function uses this information to determine the total number of digits in the list of numbers after Anna's moves. It then checks if this total is greater than or equal to `m + 1` to determine the winner.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` or `m` is 0. It also correctly handles the case where the list of numbers contains only one element.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
