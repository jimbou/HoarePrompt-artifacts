Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem requires determining who will win in a game where two players, Anna and Sasha, take turns modifying a list of integers. The game ends when there is only one integer left in the list, and the player who wins is determined by whether the remaining integer is greater than or equal to 10^m, where m is a given non-negative integer.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `zerocnts`. The `func_1` function calculates the total number of digits in all integers in the list minus the number of zeros in every other integer (starting from the integer with the most zeros). This is done by first calculating the total number of digits in all integers, then subtracting the number of zeros in every other integer.

The `zerocnts` function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a given integer. This is done by converting the integer to a string and counting the number of trailing zeros.

The program then returns 'Sasha' if the total number of digits minus the number of zeros is greater than or equal to m + 1, and 'Anna' otherwise.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the game logic and correctly determines who will win based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
