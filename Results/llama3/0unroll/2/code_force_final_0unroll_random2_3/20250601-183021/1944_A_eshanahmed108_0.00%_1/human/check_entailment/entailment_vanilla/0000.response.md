Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The given program attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of islands (n) and the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (k).
3. The program then checks if n - k is less than or equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints n; otherwise, it prints 1.

The logic behind this program is as follows:

- If n - k is less than or equal to 1, it means that even if Dominater destroys k bridges, Everule can still visit all the islands. This is because there are at least n - 1 bridges remaining, which is sufficient to connect all the islands. Therefore, the program prints n in this case.
- If n - k is greater than 1, it means that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from the rest of the islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1, so the program prints 1.

Based on this analysis, the program seems to be correct. It correctly handles the two possible scenarios and prints the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

Correctness: **True**
