This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. It then evaluates the condition n - k <= 1 for each test case and prints the result. If the condition is true, it prints the value of n; otherwise, it prints 1. The function repeats this process for each test case, with the number of test cases specified by an initial integer t read from standard input.
