Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function first checks if the input string is equal to 'mapie'. If it is, the function returns 1, because deleting one character ('a') makes the string beautiful.

If the input string is not 'mapie', the function enters a while loop that continues as long as the string contains the substring 'map'. In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the first occurrence of 'map' in the string, removes the first two characters of 'map' ('ma'), and increments the answer by 1.

After the while loop, the function enters another while loop that continues as long as the string contains the substring 'pie'. In each iteration of the loop, the function finds the first occurrence of 'pie' in the string, removes the first two characters of 'pie' ('pi'), and increments the answer by 1.

Finally, the function returns the answer, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then calls the `func_1(s)` function with the input string and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
