Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and 'map' is not a substring of s, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the initial string s.**

In this output state, the string s has been modified to remove all non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'map'. The variable ans has been incremented by the number of times 'map' was found and removed from s. The rest of the variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
