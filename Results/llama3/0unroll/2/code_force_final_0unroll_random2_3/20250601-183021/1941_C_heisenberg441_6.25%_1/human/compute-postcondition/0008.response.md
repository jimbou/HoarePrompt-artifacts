Functionality: **This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the original string. If the input string is exactly 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the input string and returns the total count of removed 'pie' occurrences.**
