Output State: s is the initial string with all occurrences of 'pie' removed, and ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the initial string s.

In natural language, the output state is that the string s has been modified to remove all occurrences of the substring 'pie', and the variable ans now holds the count of how many times 'pie' appeared in the original string s.
