Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring "pie" in the original string. If the input string is exactly "mapie", it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the input string and returns the total count of removed "pie" occurrences.

However, the problem statement requires the program to return the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program only counts the occurrences of "pie" and does not consider the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to remove both "pie" and "map" substrings.

For example, in the test case "mappppie", the program returns 2, which is the count of "pie" occurrences. However, the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful is 3 (delete "map" and one "p" from "pie").

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
