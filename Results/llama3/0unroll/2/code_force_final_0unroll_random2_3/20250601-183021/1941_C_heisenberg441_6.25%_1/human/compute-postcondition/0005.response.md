Output State: s is the initial string with all non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' removed, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the initial string s.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the string 'pie' is found in the string s. In each iteration, it removes the first occurrence of 'pie' from the string s and increments the counter ans by 1. Once 'pie' is no longer found in s, the loop terminates, leaving s with all non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' removed and ans with the count of how many times 'pie' was found in the initial string s.
