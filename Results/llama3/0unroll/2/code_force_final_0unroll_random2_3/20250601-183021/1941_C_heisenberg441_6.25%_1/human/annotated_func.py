#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State: *s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and s is not equal to 'mapie'
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and 'map' is not a substring of s, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the initial string s.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: s is the initial string with all occurrences of 'pie' removed, and ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the initial string s.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state is that the string s has been modified to remove all occurrences of the substring 'pie', and the variable ans now holds the count of how many times 'pie' appeared in the original string s.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the initial string s.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the original string. If the input string is exactly 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the input string and returns the total count of removed 'pie' occurrences.
