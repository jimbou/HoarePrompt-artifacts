Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function first checks if the input string `s` is equal to "mapie". If it is, the function returns 1, indicating that one character needs to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

If the input string is not equal to "mapie", the function enters a while loop that continues until the string `s` no longer contains the substring "map". In each iteration of the loop, the function removes the first occurrence of "map" from the string `s` and increments the variable `ans` by 1. The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of non-overlapping occurrences of "map" in the initial string `s`.

After the while loop, the function enters another while loop that continues until the string `s` no longer contains the substring "pie". In each iteration of the loop, the function removes the first occurrence of "pie" from the string `s` and increments the variable `ans` by 1. The variable `ans` now keeps track of the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the initial string `s`.

Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself, and calls the function `func_1` with the string `s` as input. The function returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, and the program prints this value.

Correctness: **True**
