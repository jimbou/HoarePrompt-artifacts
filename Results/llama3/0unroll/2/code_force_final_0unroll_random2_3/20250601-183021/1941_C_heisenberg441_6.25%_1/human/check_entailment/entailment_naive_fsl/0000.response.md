Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the string contains the substring "mapie". According to the problem description, the string is considered ugly if it contains the substring "pie" or the substring "map", but the program does not handle this case correctly. 

For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will return 1, but the correct answer should be 2, because both "map" and "pie" are present in the string.

The program only checks for the presence of "map" and "pie" separately, but it does not consider the case when both substrings are present together. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
