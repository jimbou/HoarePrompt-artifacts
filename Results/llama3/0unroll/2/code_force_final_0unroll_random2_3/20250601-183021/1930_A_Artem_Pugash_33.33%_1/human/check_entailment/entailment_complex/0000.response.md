Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and the number of integers (`numInteger`) correctly.
2. It reads the `2n` integers for each test case and stores them in the `numbers` list.
3. It sorts the `numbers` list in ascending order, which is necessary to find the minimum of each pair of integers.
4. It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will store the sum of the minimum of each pair of integers.
5. The program then enters a while loop that continues until the `numbers` list is empty. In each iteration, it:
	* Pops the first two elements from the sorted `numbers` list (which are the smallest two integers).
	* Adds the minimum of these two integers to `suma`.
6. After the while loop finishes, the program prints the final value of `suma`, which is the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the provided example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
