Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of integers written on the whiteboard (2n) and the integers themselves.
2. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is a crucial step to ensure that the minimum of each pair of integers is added to the score.
3. The program then enters a while loop that continues until all integers have been processed. In each iteration, it pops the first two integers from the sorted list, adds the minimum of the two to the score, and removes them from the list.
4. After processing all integers, the program prints the maximum final score that can be achieved.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When there is only one pair of integers (n=1), it correctly adds the minimum of the two to the score.
* When there are multiple pairs of integers (n>1), it correctly adds the minimum of each pair to the score.
* When all integers are the same, it correctly adds the same value to the score for each pair.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
