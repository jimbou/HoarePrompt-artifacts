Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
3. It defines a string `s` containing the first 26 lowercase English alphabets.
4. The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which takes `n` and `k` as input.
5. Inside `func_1`, it calculates the string `s` by repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times.
6. The resulting string `s` is returned and printed for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because:

* By repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times, it ensures that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
* The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, as it simply returns the first `k` characters of the alphabet.
* The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is 1, as it returns a string of length `n` consisting of the same character repeated `n` times.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable `s` is defined as a string containing the first 26 lowercase English alphabets, but it is not necessary to define it with all 26 characters. It would be more efficient to define it with only the first `k` characters, as that is all that is needed.

Correctness: **True**
