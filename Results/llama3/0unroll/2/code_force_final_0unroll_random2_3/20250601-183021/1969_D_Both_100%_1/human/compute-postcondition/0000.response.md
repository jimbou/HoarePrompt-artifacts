Output State: **`test_cases` is a value returned by `func_1()`.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_1()`. The initial state of `test_cases` being a positive integer is no longer valid, as its value is now determined by the return value of `func_1()`.
