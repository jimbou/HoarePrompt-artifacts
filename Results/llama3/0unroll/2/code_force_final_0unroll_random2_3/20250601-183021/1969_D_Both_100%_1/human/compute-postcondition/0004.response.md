Functionality: **This function calculates the total sum of specific pairs of integers from two lists, `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`. It sums the first elements of all pairs in `secondary_heap` and adds the sums of pairs from `primary_items` where both integers in a pair are non-negative. The function returns this total sum without modifying the input lists.**
