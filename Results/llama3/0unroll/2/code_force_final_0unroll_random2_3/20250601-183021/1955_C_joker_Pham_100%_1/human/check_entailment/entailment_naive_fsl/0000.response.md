Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to simulate the Kraken's attack on the ships and count the number of ships sunk. The program handles the edge cases where the number of attacks is 0, the number of ships is 1, and the durability of the ships is 0.

The program uses a while loop to simulate the attacks, and it correctly updates the durability of the ships and the number of sunk ships. The program also handles the case where the number of attacks is greater than the sum of the durability of the ships.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
