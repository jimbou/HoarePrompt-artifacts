Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, t is 1, tree is an empty deque, empty is True, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.**

In this output state, the values of n and t are assigned from the first line of stdin. The tree is initialized as an empty deque, and the variable empty is set to True. The remaining lines in stdin are unchanged, containing n-1 lines with two integers u and v, and one integer u_1.
