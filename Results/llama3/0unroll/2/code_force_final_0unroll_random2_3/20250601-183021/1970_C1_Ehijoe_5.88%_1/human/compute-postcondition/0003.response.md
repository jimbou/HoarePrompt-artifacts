Output State: **tree is a deque containing a path of length n from u_1 to all other nodes in the tree, empty is False, t is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, start is an integer, idx is an integer, and moves is a list containing two integers.**

The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `start`. It then finds the index of `start` in the `tree` deque and assigns it to the variable `idx`. Finally, it calculates the minimum value between `t` and `idx`, and the minimum value between `t` and `n - idx - 1`, and stores these values in the `moves` list.

The values of `tree`, `empty`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The `start` variable is assigned the value of the input integer, and the `idx` variable is assigned the index of `start` in the `tree` deque. The `moves` list is created and populated with the calculated minimum values.
