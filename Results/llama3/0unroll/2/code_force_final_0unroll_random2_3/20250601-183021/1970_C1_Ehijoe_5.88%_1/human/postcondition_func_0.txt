Determines the winner of a game based on the parity of the minimum number of moves required to reach a target node in a tree structure. The function reads input from stdin, constructs a tree path, and calculates the minimum moves to the start node. If at least one of the minimum moves is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'.
