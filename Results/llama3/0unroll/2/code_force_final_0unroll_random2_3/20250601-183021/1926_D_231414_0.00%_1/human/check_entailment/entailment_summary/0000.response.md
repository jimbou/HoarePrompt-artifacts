Reasoning:
The program is correct. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the numbers and their complements. For each number, it checks if its complement is in the dictionary. If it is, it decrements the count of the complement and reduces the answer by 1. If the count of the complement becomes 0, it removes the complement from the dictionary. If the number is not in the dictionary, it adds it to the dictionary with a count of 1. The answer is initialized to the total number of integers and is reduced by 1 for each pair of complementary integers found.

Correctness: **True**
