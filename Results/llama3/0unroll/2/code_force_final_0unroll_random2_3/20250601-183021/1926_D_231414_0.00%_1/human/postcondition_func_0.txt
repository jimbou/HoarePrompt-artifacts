This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n space-separated integers. For each test case, it calculates the number of pairs of integers that are complementary (i.e., their bitwise XOR is equal to 2^31-1) and prints the number of non-complementary integers. The function processes all test cases and leaves the input stream empty.
