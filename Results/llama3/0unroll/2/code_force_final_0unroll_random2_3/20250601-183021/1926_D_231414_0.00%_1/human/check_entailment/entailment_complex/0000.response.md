Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition that no two numbers in the same group have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit.

The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the numbers and their complements. For each number, it checks if its complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, it decrements the count of the complement and increments the answer. If the count of the complement becomes zero, it removes the complement from the dictionary. If the number is already in the dictionary, it increments its count. If the number is not in the dictionary, it adds it with a count of 1.

The program correctly handles the case where a number is its own complement (i.e., the number is 0 or 2^31-1). In this case, it simply increments the count of the number in the dictionary.

The program also correctly handles the case where a number and its complement are both present in the input. In this case, it correctly decrements the count of the complement and increments the answer.

The program prints the answer for each test case, which is the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition.

Correctness: **True**
