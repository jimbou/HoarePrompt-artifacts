Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input contains duplicate numbers. In this case, the program will incorrectly count the number of groups required. For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1], the program will output 4, but the correct answer is 1.

The issue is that the program uses a dictionary to keep track of the numbers and their complements, but it does not handle duplicate numbers correctly. When a duplicate number is encountered, the program will increment the count of the number in the dictionary, but it will not decrement the count of the complement. This will lead to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle duplicate numbers correctly. One possible solution is to use a set to keep track of the numbers and their complements, instead of a dictionary. This will ensure that each number is only counted once, even if it appears multiple times in the input.
