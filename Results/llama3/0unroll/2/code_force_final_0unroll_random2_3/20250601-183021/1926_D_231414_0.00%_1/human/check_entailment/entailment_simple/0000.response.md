Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition that any two numbers in the same group do not have matching bit values among bits from 1-st to 31-st bit.

The program uses a dictionary to keep track of the numbers and their complements. For each number, it checks if its complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, it decrements the count and reduces the answer by 1. If the count becomes 0, it removes the complement from the dictionary. If the number is already in the dictionary, it increments the count. If the number is not in the dictionary, it adds it with a count of 1.

The program correctly handles the case where a number and its complement are both present in the input, and it correctly handles the case where a number is present multiple times in the input.

The program also correctly prints the answer for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
