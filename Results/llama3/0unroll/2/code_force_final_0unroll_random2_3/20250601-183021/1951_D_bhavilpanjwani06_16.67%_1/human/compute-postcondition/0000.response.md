Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 999). Each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be positive integers, as they are assigned the values from the input. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed, so it now contains t-1 lines. The values of `n` and `k` in the remaining lines are still positive integers between 1 and 10^18.
