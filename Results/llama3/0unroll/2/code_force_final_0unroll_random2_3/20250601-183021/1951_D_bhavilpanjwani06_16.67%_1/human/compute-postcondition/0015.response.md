Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 999). Each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). n is larger than or equal to k and n is not equal to k. The current value of k-1 is less than the current value of n-k+1, and 'YES' is printed**
