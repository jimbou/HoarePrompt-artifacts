Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and each subsequent line contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). It then checks the relationship between n and k, and based on the comparison, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by additional information. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO'. If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES', 1, and the value of n (which is equal to k). If n is greater than k, it checks if k-1 is less than n-k+1, and if true, it prints 'YES', 2, and the values of n-k+1 and 1. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
