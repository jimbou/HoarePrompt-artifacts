Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 999). Each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to `k` is printed. If `n` is larger than `k`, then if k-1 is less than n-k+1, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the value of n-k+1 and 1 are printed. If k-1 is not less than n-k+1, 'NO' is printed.***
