Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 999). Each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18). The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`, and 'NO' is being printed**
