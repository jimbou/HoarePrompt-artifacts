Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases based on the relationship between the number of coins Alice has (n) and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy (k). 

If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy k jewels with less than k coins. 

If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES', 1, and the value of n (which is equal to k) because Alice can buy k jewels with k coins by spending all her coins at the first stall. 

If n is greater than k, it checks if k-1 is less than n-k+1. If true, it prints 'YES', 2, and the values of n-k+1 and 1. This is because Alice can buy k jewels by spending n-k+1 coins at the first stall (buying 1 jewel) and then spending the remaining k-1 coins at the second stall (buying k-1 jewels). If k-1 is not less than n-k+1, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy k jewels with the given number of coins.

Correctness: **True**
