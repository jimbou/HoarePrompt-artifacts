The code prints the value of `n`, which is equal to the current value of `k`. Since 'YES' is being printed and 1 is being printed, it indicates that the condition for printing 'YES' and 1 has been met, and now the value of `n` (which is equal to `k`) is being printed.
Output: **k (where k is the current value of k, which is equal to n)**
