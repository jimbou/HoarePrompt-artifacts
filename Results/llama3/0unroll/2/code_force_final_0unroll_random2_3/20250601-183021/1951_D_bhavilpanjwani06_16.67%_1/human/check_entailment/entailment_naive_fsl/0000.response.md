Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 255 and k = 8, the program prints "NO", but the correct answer is "YES" with the prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

The issue with the program is that it only considers three cases: when n < k, when n == k, and when k - 1 < n - k + 1. However, there are other cases that are not covered by these conditions. For instance, when k - 1 >= n - k + 1, the program should try to find a combination of prices that would allow Alice to buy exactly k jewels, but it does not do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly.
