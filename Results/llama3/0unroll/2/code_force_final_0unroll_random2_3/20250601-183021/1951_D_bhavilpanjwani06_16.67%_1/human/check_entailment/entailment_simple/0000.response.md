Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases:

1. If n < k, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to buy exactly k jewels with less than k coins.

2. If n == k, it prints 'YES', 1, and n. This is correct because Alice can buy 1 jewel at a price of n coins, and she will have no coins left.

3. If n > k, it checks if k - 1 < n - k + 1. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', 2, n - k + 1, and 1. This is correct because Alice can buy n - k + 1 jewels at a price of 1 coin each, and then buy 1 jewel at a price of k - 1 coins. If this condition is false, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to buy exactly k jewels.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to buy exactly k jewels with n coins and prints the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
