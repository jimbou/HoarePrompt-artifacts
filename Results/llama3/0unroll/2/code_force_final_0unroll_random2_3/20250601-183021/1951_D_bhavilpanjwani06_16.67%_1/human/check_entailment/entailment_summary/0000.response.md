Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up the store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program checks the relationship between the number of coins Alice has (n) and the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy (k), and based on this comparison, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by additional information.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

1. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because Alice does not have enough coins to buy k jewels.
2. If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES', 1, and the value of n (which is equal to k) because Alice can buy k jewels at a price of n coins per jewel.
3. If n is greater than k, it checks if k-1 is less than n-k+1. If true, it prints 'YES', 2, and the values of n-k+1 and 1. This is because Alice can buy k-1 jewels at a price of n-k+1 coins per jewel, and then buy 1 jewel at a price of 1 coin per jewel. If k-1 is not less than n-k+1, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to set up the store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
