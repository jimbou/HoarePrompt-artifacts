Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The profit is calculated based on the number of buns sold at a modified price (k) and the number of buns sold at the usual price (n-k).

Function 1 calculates the profit for a given value of k, n, a, and b. It correctly calculates the profit as the sum of the profit from selling k buns at the modified price and the profit from selling (n-k) buns at the usual price.

Function 2 uses a binary search approach to find the maximum profit by iterating over all possible values of k from 0 to the minimum of n and b. It correctly updates the maximum profit and the search range (low and high) based on the comparison of the profit at the current mid value and the profit at the next mid value.

The main function reads the input, calls Function 2 for each test case, and prints the maximum profit.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
