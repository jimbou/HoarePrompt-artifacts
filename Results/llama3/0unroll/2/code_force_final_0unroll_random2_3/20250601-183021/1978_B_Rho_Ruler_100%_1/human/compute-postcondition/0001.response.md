Output State: **low is the maximum value of mid such that func_1(mid, n, a, b) is maximum, high is low - 1, max_profit is the maximum value of func_1(mid, n, a, b) for all mid from 0 to the minimum of n and b.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has found the maximum value of the function func_1(mid, n, a, b) for all mid from 0 to the minimum of n and b, and has stored this maximum value in max_profit. The loop has also found the maximum value of mid for which func_1(mid, n, a, b) is maximum, and has stored this value in low. The value of high is one less than the value of low. The values of n, a, and b remain unchanged.
