Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the profit for a given value of k, which represents the number of buns sold at a modified price. The function takes into account the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b) and the usual price of a bun (a). It returns a value representing the weighted sum of k and n-k, where k is bounded by the minimum of n and b.

`func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the maximum profit by iteratively adjusting the search range (`low` and `high`) to find the maximum value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. The function takes four parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and returns the maximum profit value.

The program's main function reads the input, calls `func_2` for each test case, and prints the result.

Based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that both functions are working correctly. `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for a given value of k, and `func_2` correctly finds the maximum profit by searching through the possible values of k.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
