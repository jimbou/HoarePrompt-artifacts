Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given value of k, and the function `func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the value of k that maximizes the profit.

The binary search approach is correct because the profit function is unimodal, meaning that it first increases and then decreases as k increases. This is because the profit from selling the first k buns at a modified price increases as k increases, but the profit from selling the remaining (n-k) buns at the usual price decreases as k increases.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is 0 (in which case all buns are sold at the usual price) and when k is equal to min(n, b) (in which case all buns are sold at the modified price).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
