Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, b is an integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, low is 0, high is the minimum of n and b, max_profit is 0**

The code initializes three new variables: `low`, `high`, and `max_profit`. The value of `low` is set to 0. The value of `high` is set to the minimum of `n` and `b`, which means it will be the smaller of the two values. The value of `max_profit` is set to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
