Output State: **The final output state is the number of ways to place dominoes on a grid of size n x n with k pairs of cells already occupied, modulo 10^9 + 7.**

In natural language, the output state represents the number of ways to place dominoes on a grid of size n x n, where k pairs of cells are already occupied. The number of ways is calculated using dynamic programming, taking into account the number of empty cells (m) and the number of pairs of occupied cells (k). The output state is the result of the dynamic programming calculation, modulo 10^9 + 7.
