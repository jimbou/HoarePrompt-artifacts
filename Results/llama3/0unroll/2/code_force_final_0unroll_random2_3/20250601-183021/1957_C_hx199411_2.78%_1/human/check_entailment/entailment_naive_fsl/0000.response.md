Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem of finding the number of different final configurations in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard. The program correctly calculates the number of possible configurations by considering the number of moves already played and the size of the chessboard.

The program first calculates the number of rows and columns that are blocked by the already played moves. If a move is on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`), it blocks only one row or column, otherwise, it blocks two. The number of blocked rows and columns is stored in the variable `num`.

Then, the program calculates the number of remaining rows and columns that are not blocked, which is stored in the variable `m`. If `m` is 0, there are no valid moves remaining, and the program prints 0. If `m` is 1, there is only one valid move remaining, and the program prints 1.

For `m` greater than 1, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which represent the base cases for one and two remaining rows and columns, respectively.

The program then iterates from `i = 3` to `m` and calculates `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This recurrence relation is based on the fact that for each remaining row and column, there are two possibilities: either the white rook is placed in the current row and column, or it is not.

Finally, the program prints the value of `dp[m]`, which represents the total number of possible final configurations modulo `10 ** 9 + 7`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the base cases for `m = 0`, `m = 1`, and `m > 1`. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the program efficiently calculates the number of possible configurations for large values of `m`.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
