Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) on the first line, and k lines of two integers r_i and c_i (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n) on the following lines.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value, which is the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case than before, and each remaining test case still consists of two integers `n` and `k` on the first line, followed by `k` lines of two integers `r_i` and `c_i`.
