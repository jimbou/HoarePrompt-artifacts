Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves, considering the mirroring of moves by the computer.

The program first calculates the number of occupied cells (num) by counting the number of moves where the row and column are the same (which occupies one cell) and the number of moves where the row and column are different (which occupies two cells).

Then, it calculates the number of remaining cells (m) by subtracting the occupied cells from the total number of cells on the board.

If there are no remaining cells (m == 0), the program prints 0, as there are no possible final configurations.

If there is only one remaining cell (m == 1), the program prints 1, as there is only one possible final configuration (placing a rook in that cell).

If there are more than one remaining cells (m > 1), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations. It initializes a list dp of size m+1, where dp[i] represents the number of possible final configurations with i remaining cells.

The base cases are dp[1] = 1 (one possible configuration with one remaining cell) and dp[2] = 3 (three possible configurations with two remaining cells: placing a rook in one of the two cells, or placing a rook in both cells).

For i > 2, the program calculates dp[i] as the sum of two terms:

* dp[i-1]: the number of possible final configurations with i-1 remaining cells (by placing a rook in one of the i remaining cells)
* (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2: the number of possible final configurations with i-2 remaining cells (by placing a rook in two of the i remaining cells), multiplied by the number of ways to choose two cells out of i (i-1), and multiplied by 2 (since the rooks can be placed in either order)

The program then prints the value of dp[m] modulo 10^9 + 7, which represents the number of possible final configurations with m remaining cells.

Correctness: **True**
