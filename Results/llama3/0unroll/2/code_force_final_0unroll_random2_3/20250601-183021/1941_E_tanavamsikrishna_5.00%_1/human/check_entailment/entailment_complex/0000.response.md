Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges on a river. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d` as input. It increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1, and then increments the remaining elements by the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified list, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for a single bridge.

`func_2` reads input from the user, including the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of consecutive costs to consider `k`, the distance `d`, and the rows themselves. It calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive costs. The function prints the smallest sum of `k` consecutive costs, which represents the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

The program correctly implements the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. The functions work together to calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges, considering the constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
