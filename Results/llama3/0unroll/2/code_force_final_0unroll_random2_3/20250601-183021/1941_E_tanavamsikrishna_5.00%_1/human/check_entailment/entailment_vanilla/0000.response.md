Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges on a river. The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance between supports `d` as input. It calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for that row. The function first initializes the cost of the first `d-1` cells to be the value of the cell plus 1. Then, for each cell from the `d-th` cell to the end of the row, it calculates the minimum cost by taking the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` cells (if they exist) and adding the value of the current cell plus 1. The function returns the minimum cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for the entire row.

`func_2` is the main function that reads the input, calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row, and then finds the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows. It first reads the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance between supports `d`. Then, it reads the depths of the river cells for each row. It calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1` and stores the costs in the `costs` list. It then calculates the total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of the corresponding rows and stores the total costs in the `total_costs` list. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row and then finds the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

Correctness: **True**
