Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The first function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, and the second function uses this result to calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for k consecutive rows.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the distance between supports is 1, and when the number of rows is less than k. The use of list comprehension and generator expressions makes the code concise and efficient.

The program also correctly prints the minimum total cost of installing supports for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
