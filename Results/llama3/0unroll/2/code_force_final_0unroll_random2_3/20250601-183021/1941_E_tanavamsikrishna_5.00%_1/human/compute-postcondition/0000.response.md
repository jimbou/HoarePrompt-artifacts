Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers where each inner list has length m, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0, costs is a list of integers, total_costs is an empty list.**

The first line of the code reads four positive integers from the input and assigns them to the variables n, m, k, and d, respectively. The second line reads n lines of input, each containing m non-negative integers, and assigns them to the variable rows. The third line calculates the cost for each row in rows using the function func_1 and assigns the results to the variable costs. The fourth line initializes an empty list called total_costs.
