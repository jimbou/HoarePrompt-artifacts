Functionality: **This function calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive costs in a list of costs, where each cost is calculated based on a given distance d and a list of rows with non-negative integers. The function takes no arguments, but instead reads input from the user, including the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of consecutive costs to consider (k), the distance (d), and the rows themselves. It then prints the smallest sum of k consecutive costs. The original input values remain unchanged.**
