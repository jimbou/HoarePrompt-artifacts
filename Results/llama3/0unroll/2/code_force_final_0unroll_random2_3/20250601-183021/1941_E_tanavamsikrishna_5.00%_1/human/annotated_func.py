#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers, d is a positive integer such that d < len(row).
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: row is a list of non-negative integers, d is a positive integer such that d < len(row), and the first d-1 elements of row are each incremented by 1.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: The first d-1 elements of row are each incremented by 1, and the remaining elements of row are each incremented by the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements plus 1.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the row, which is the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements plus 1, where the first d-1 elements of row are each incremented by 1, and the remaining elements of row are each incremented by the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements plus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function accepts a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer d as input, where d is less than the length of the list. It increments the first d-1 elements of the list by 1, and then increments the remaining elements by the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a list of lists of non-negative integers where each inner list has length m, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0.
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: The total_costs list is populated with the sum of every k consecutive elements in the costs list, starting from the first element and ending at the (len(costs) - k + 1)th element. The values of n, m, k, d, and rows remain unchanged.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: the smallest sum of k consecutive costs in the costs list

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive costs in a list of costs, where each cost is calculated based on a given distance d and a list of rows with non-negative integers. The function takes no arguments, but instead reads input from the user, including the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of consecutive costs to consider (k), the distance (d), and the rows themselves. It then prints the smallest sum of k consecutive costs. The original input values remain unchanged.
