Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a river, given the depth of each cell in the river and the maximum distance between supports.

2. Function `func_1` calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, given the depth of each cell in the row and the maximum distance between supports. It does this by incrementing the first d-1 elements of the row by 1, and then incrementing the remaining elements by the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

3. Function `func_2` calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows. It does this by first reading the input values, including the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), the number of consecutive costs to consider (k), the distance (d), and the rows themselves. It then calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`, and stores these costs in a list. Finally, it calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive costs in the list and prints the result.

4. The execution summaries of the functions match the expected behavior based on the problem description. `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row, and `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.
