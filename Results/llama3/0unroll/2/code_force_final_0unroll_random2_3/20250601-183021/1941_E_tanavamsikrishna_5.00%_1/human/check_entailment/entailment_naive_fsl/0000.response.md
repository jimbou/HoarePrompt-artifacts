Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for building k bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost for each row. The `func_1` function calculates the minimum cost for a single row by iterating through the row and updating the cost at each position based on the minimum cost of the previous positions. The `func_2` function reads the input, calculates the minimum cost for each row, and then calculates the minimum total cost for building k bridges on consecutive rows.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when k is 1, when the row has only one element, and when the maximum distance between supports is 1. The program also handles the case when the input rows have different lengths.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
