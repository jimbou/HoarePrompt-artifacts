The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value from the `total_costs` list.

Since the `total_costs` list is populated with the sum of every k consecutive elements in the `costs` list, the minimum value in this list represents the smallest sum of k consecutive costs.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest sum of k consecutive costs in the `costs` list.

Output: **the smallest sum of k consecutive costs in the costs list**
