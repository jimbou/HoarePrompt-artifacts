This function generates 1000 sets of three random digits between 1 and 9, prints each set, and then prints a string indicating whether the digits form a "peak" (the middle digit is greater than the first and last), a "stair" (the middle digit is greater than the first but less than the last), or "none" (otherwise). The function does not take any input and does not return any value.
