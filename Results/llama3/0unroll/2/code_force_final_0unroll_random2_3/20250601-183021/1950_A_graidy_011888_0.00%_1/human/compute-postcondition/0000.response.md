Output State: **`i` is 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been set to 1. The stdin still contains two inputs: the first input is an integer t, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and the second input consists of t lines, each containing three digits a, b, and c, where each digit is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
