This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the shape ('TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE') of the figure formed by '1's in each test case. It iterates through each test case, examining the strings to determine the shape, and outputs the result for each case. The function does not modify the input value `t` and only uses it to control the number of iterations.
