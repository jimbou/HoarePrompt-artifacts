Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if a string has exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle, and if a string has more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. However, this approach is not sufficient to correctly identify the shape.

For example, a triangle can have more than one '1' in a string, as long as the '1's are consecutive and the central '1's are in the same column. Similarly, a square can have exactly one '1' in a string, as long as the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program does not correctly check for these conditions, and therefore, it may produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
