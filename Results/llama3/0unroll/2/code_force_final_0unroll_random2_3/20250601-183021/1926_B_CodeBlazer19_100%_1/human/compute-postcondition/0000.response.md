The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

The remaining input in the stdin is the test cases, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` strings of `n` characters each.

The output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` strings of `n` characters each.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10) followed by `n` strings of `n` characters each.**
