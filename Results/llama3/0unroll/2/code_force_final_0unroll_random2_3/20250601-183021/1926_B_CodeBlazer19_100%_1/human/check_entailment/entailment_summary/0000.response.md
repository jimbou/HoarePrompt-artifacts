Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine the shape is flawed. The program checks if a row has exactly one '1' and immediately concludes that the shape is a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine the shape. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, and a square can have only one '1' in a row. The program also does not correctly handle the case where the shape is a square.

The correct approach would be to examine the pattern of '1's in the grid and determine the shape based on that pattern. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should increase or decrease by 2, and the '1's should be centered. For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same, and the '1's should be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Correctness: **False**
