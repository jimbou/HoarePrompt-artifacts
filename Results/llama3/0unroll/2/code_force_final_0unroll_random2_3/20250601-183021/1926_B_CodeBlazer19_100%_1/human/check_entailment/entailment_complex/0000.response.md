Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if a string contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle, and if a string contains more than one '1' to determine if the shape is a square. However, this logic is not sufficient to correctly identify the shapes.

For example, a triangle can have more than one '1' in a string, and a square can have exactly one '1' in a string. The program does not consider the positions of the '1's in the strings, which is necessary to correctly identify the shapes.

A correct solution would involve checking the positions of the '1's in the strings to determine if they form a triangle or a square. This could involve checking if the '1's are centered in the strings, or if they form a square shape.

Correctness: **False**
