Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The issue lies in the way it checks for triangles and squares. 

For triangles, it only checks if there is exactly one '1' in a row, which is not sufficient to determine if it's a triangle. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

For squares, it only checks if there is more than one '1' in a row, which is not sufficient to determine if it's a square. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

A counterexample is:

Input:
```
1
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```
The program will output "TRIANGLE", but the correct output is "TRIANGLE" because the '1's form a triangle, not a square.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly check for the properties of triangles and squares. For example, it could check if the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 for triangles, and if the number of '1's is the same in each row and the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge for squares.
