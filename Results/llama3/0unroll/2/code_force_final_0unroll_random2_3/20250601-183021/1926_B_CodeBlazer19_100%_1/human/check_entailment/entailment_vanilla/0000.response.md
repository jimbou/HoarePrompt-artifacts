Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each row of the grid and checking the count of '1's in each row. If a row has exactly one '1', it sets the variable `a` to 'TRIANGLE'. If a row has more than one '1', it sets the variable `b` to 'SQUARE'. After iterating through all rows, it checks if `a` is not zero and prints 'TRIANGLE' if true, otherwise it prints 'SQUARE'.

However, this approach is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The program does not correctly identify triangles. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, but the '1's must be consecutive and centered. The program does not check for this condition.

2. The program does not correctly identify squares. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid. The program does not check for this condition.

3. The program uses the variables `a` and `b` incorrectly. The variable `a` is initialized to 0, but then assigned a string value 'TRIANGLE'. This will cause a TypeError when the program tries to check if `a` is not zero.

4. The program does not handle the case where the grid contains neither a triangle nor a square.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
