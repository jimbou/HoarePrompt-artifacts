Functionality: **This function finds and returns all divisors of a given integer q that are greater than or equal to x - 1 and less than or equal to the square root of q. It accepts two parameters, q and x, where q is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) and x is an integer such that 1 <= x < q. The function returns a list containing these divisors.**
