Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `w` is a float equal to the square root of `q` and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include the square root of `q`, which is also the current value of `w`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `M` now contains a single element, which is the square root of `q`. The value of `w` is still the square root of `q` and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
