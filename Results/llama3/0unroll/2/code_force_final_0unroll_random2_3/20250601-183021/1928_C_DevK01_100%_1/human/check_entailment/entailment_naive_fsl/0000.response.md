Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k values that fit the given constraints. It first checks if the sum of the position and the number received during settling is even, and if not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. If the sum is even, it calculates the possible values of k using the func_1 function and stores them in the L1 list. It then removes duplicates from the list and prints the length of the list, which represents the number of different k values that fit the given constraints.

The func_1 function calculates the possible values of k by finding the factors of the given number q that are greater than or equal to x-1. It first checks if the square root of q is an integer and greater than or equal to x-1, and if so, it adds it to the list of possible k values. It then iterates from 1 to the square root of q, checking if q is divisible by each number and if the quotient is greater than or equal to x-1. If so, it adds both the divisor and the quotient to the list of possible k values.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the position and the number received during settling are 1, and where the position is a multiple of the number received during settling. It also correctly handles cases where the position is greater than the number received during settling.

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
