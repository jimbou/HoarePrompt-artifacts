Postcondition: ***q is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, x is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, w is a float equal to the square root of q. If the square root of q is an integer and is greater than or equal to x - 1, then M is a list containing the square root of q. Otherwise, M remains an empty list.***
