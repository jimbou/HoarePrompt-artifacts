Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the minimum possible penalty for a given string `expression` of length `length`. It initializes a counter `count` to 0 and then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '+', it increments the counter. After the loop, it calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count from the length of the string.

The function then returns the absolute difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of '-' characters. This is because the penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and in this case, the sum is the difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of '-' characters.

The main part of the program then calls the `func_1` function for each test case and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum possible penalty by finding the absolute difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of '-' characters in the string.

Correctness: **True**
