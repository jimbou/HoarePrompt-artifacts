Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string 'expression'. This is equivalent to finding the absolute value of the sum of the array represented by the string, since '+' represents 1 and '-' represents -1.

The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is either 0 or as close to 0 as possible. This is because the penalty for a subarray is proportional to its length, so minimizing the absolute value of the sum of each subarray minimizes the total penalty.

The program's approach of calculating the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters achieves this goal, since it effectively finds the minimum possible absolute value of the sum of the array.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
