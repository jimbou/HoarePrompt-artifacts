Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `expression` and its length `length` as input, and returns the minimum possible penalty that can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays.

The program correctly calculates the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, and then returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters. This is in line with the problem statement, which defines the penalty of a single array as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including cases where the string contains only '+' characters, only '-' characters, or a mix of both. It also handles cases where the length of the string is 1, in which case the penalty is simply the absolute value of the single character.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.
