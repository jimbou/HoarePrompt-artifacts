#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a non-negative integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a non-negative integer equal to the length of expression, count is the number of '+' characters in expression.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters in the string 'expression'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in a given string 'expression'. It accepts a string 'expression' and its length as input, and returns a non-negative integer representing the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.
