Output State: **expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", length is a non-negative integer equal to the length of expression, count is the number of '+' characters in expression, sub is the number of '-' characters in expression.**

In this output state, the value of `sub` is calculated as the difference between the total length of the expression and the number of '+' characters in it, which effectively gives the number of '-' characters in the expression. The values of `expression`, `length`, and `count` remain unchanged.
