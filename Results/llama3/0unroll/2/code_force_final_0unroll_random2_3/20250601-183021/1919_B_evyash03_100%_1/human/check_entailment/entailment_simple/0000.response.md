Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the number of '+' characters in the string 'expression' and then calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' characters from the length of the string. It then returns the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters.

This approach is correct because the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is either 0 or as close to 0 as possible. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so a sum of 0 results in a penalty of 0.

By calculating the absolute difference between the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters, the program is effectively calculating the minimum possible penalty. This is because the number of '-' characters and the number of '+' characters represent the negative and positive sums of the subarrays, respectively, and the absolute difference between them represents the minimum possible penalty.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
