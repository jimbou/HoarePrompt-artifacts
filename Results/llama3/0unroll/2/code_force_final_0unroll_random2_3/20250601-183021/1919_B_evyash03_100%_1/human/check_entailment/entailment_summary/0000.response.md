Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by finding the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string 'expression'. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, which results in a penalty equal to the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
