Reasoning:

The problem requires us to count the number of initial arrays `a` such that the prefix sum array `p` after sorting results in the given sorted prefix sum array. The given program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

Function 1 (`func_1`) initializes a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `2n + 1`, where `n` is the size of the hidden array `a`. The table is initialized with all zeros except for the middle element, which is set to 1. This represents the initial state where the sum of the prefix sums is 0.

The function then iterates over the prefix sum array `p`. For each element `p_i` in `p`, it updates the dynamic programming table `dp` by considering two cases:

1. If the current sum `j` is less than or equal to `2n`, it adds the value of `dp[j]` to `dp[j + 1]`. This represents the case where the next element in the prefix sum array is 1.
2. If the current sum `j` is greater than or equal to 0, it adds the value of `dp[j]` to `dp[j - 1]`. This represents the case where the next element in the prefix sum array is -1.

The function finally returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the sum of the last element of `p` and the offset `n`.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads the input data, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The dynamic programming table `dp` is updated correctly based on the prefix sum array `p`, and the final result is calculated correctly.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The program does not define the modulo value `MOD` used in the dynamic programming updates. This value should be defined as `MOD = 998244353` to match the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
