Output State: The loop will execute t times, and after each iteration, the value of index will increase by n+1, where n is the value read from data at the current index. The list results will contain t elements, each of which is the result of calling func_1 with the current n and p. The values of n and p will be updated in each iteration to the next set of values read from data. The values of stdin and data will remain unchanged.
