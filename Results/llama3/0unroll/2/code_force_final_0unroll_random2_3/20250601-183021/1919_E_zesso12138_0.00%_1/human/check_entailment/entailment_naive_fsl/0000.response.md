Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program uses dynamic programming to count the number of initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

The function `func_1` initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `2*n + 1`, where `n` is the size of the hidden array `a`. The array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum. The function then iterates over the prefix sum array `p` and updates the `dp` array accordingly.

The function `func_2` reads the input data, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including edge cases such as when the prefix sum array `p` contains only one element, or when the sum of the prefix sum array `p` is equal to `n` or `-n`.

The program also correctly handles cases where the prefix sum array `p` contains duplicate elements, as it uses the modulo operator to avoid overflow.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
