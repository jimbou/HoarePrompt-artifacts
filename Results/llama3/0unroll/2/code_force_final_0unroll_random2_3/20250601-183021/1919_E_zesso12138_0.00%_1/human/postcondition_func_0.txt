This function calculates the number of ways to reach a specific index in a list after a certain number of steps, based on a given list of integers and a positive integer. The function takes a list of integers and a positive integer as input, and returns the number of ways to reach the index that is equal to the last element of the list plus an offset, after the specified number of steps. The calculation is performed using dynamic programming, with the middle element being 1 and all other elements being the sum of the elements at indices j-1 and j+1 in the previous iteration, modulo a certain constant MOD. The function does not modify the input list or the input integer.
