Reasoning:

The problem asks us to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The given program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for a given set of friendships. It iterates over each friendship, calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for that friendship, and adds it to the total result.

`func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

However, there are a few issues with the given program:

1. The program does not calculate the probability of choosing a pair of friends, which is necessary to calculate the expected value.

2. The program does not take into account the fact that the friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each excursion.

3. The program does not calculate the modular inverse of the denominator, which is necessary to calculate the final result.

4. The program does not handle the case where the number of pairs of friends is 0.

5. The program does not handle the case where the number of excursions is 0.

6. The program does not handle the case where the number of children is 0.

7. The program does not handle the case where the number of pairs of friends is greater than the number of children.

8. The program does not handle the case where the number of excursions is greater than the number of pairs of friends.

9. The program does not handle the case where the friendship value of a pair of friends is 0.

10. The program does not handle the case where the friendship value of a pair of friends is greater than the number of excursions.
