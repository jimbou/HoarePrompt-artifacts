Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving friendships and excursions. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Function 1 calculates the sum of a weighted arithmetic series for each tuple in a list of friendships, where the weight is the product of a friendship factor and a triangular number, and returns the total sum modulo a constant.

Function 2 accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and friendships, where n, m, and k are integers and friendships is a list of lists containing integers. It processes the input data and returns a result, which is then printed as output. The function is called t times, with different input values for n, m, k, and friendships each time, and the results are printed in a list.

However, there is a logical error in Function 1. The function calculates the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all tuples in `friendships`, but it does not take into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion. The probability of choosing a pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, which is not considered in the calculation.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
