Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

The key insight to the problem is that the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions is equal to the sum of the expected value of each pair's friendship value. 

The expected value of each pair's friendship value can be calculated as follows: 

- The probability that a pair is chosen in each excursion is 2/(n*(n-1)), where n is the number of children. 
- The expected value of a pair's friendship value in each excursion is the probability that the pair is chosen times the pair's current friendship value. 
- Since the pair's friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion that the pair is chosen, the expected value of a pair's friendship value in each excursion is the probability that the pair is chosen times the pair's initial friendship value plus the number of excursions that the pair has been chosen so far. 

The program correctly calculates the expected value of each pair's friendship value by summing up the expected value of each pair's friendship value in each excursion, and then sums up the expected value of all pairs' friendship values.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of children is large and the number of excursions is large, by using the modulo operator to prevent overflow.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
