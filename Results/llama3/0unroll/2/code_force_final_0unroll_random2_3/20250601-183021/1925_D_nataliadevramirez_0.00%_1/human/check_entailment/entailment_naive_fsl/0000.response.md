Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not take into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that the teacher chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently for each excursion. This means that the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion is not constant, but rather depends on the number of pairs of friends and the total number of pairs of children.

The program, however, assumes that the probability of choosing a pair of friends is constant and equal to 1, which is not the case. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

For example, consider a case where there are 3 children, 2 pairs of friends, and 2 excursions. The friendships are (1, 2, 3) and (2, 3, 4). The program would calculate the expected value as 3 * (2 * (2 + 1) // 2) + 4 * (2 * (2 + 1) // 2) = 30. However, this is not the correct expected value, as the probability of choosing each pair of friends is not constant.

To correctly calculate the expected value, the program would need to take into account the probability of choosing each pair of friends in each excursion, which depends on the number of pairs of friends and the total number of pairs of children.
