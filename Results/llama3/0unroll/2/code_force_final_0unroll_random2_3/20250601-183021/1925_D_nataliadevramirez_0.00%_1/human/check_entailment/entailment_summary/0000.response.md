Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

Func_1 calculates the sum of a weighted arithmetic series for each tuple in a list of friendships, where the weight is the product of a friendship factor and a triangular number, and returns the total sum modulo a constant.

Func_2 accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and friendships, where n, m, and k are integers and friendships is a list of lists containing integers. It processes the input data and returns a result, which is then printed as output. The function is called t times, with different input values for n, m, k, and friendships each time, and the results are printed in a list.

However, the given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions, taking into account the increase in friendship value for each pair chosen. The given program only calculates the sum of a weighted arithmetic series for each tuple in a list of friendships, without considering the increase in friendship value.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
