Output State: **The program returns the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all tuples in `friendships`, where `f` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `MOD` is a constant, modulo `MOD`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns the total sum of a calculation involving the values of `f` and `k` from each tuple in the `friendships` list, with the result taken modulo `MOD`.
