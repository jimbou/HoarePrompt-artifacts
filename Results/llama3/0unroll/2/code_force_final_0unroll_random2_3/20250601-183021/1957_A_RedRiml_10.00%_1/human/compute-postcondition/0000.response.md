Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the variable `w` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin now contains one less test case, i.e., t-1 test cases, each with two lines as described in the initial state.
