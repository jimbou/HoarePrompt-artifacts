The code snippet reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input, where `x` is between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is between 1 and `x`. It then initializes a variable `ans` to 0.

After executing the code, the variable `x` will hold the value of the first integer read from the input, and the variable `n` will hold the value of the second integer read from the input. The variable `ans` will remain 0, as it is not modified by the code.

The input will be modified, as the first line of the code reads two integers from the input, leaving the remaining input unchanged.

Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ x).**
