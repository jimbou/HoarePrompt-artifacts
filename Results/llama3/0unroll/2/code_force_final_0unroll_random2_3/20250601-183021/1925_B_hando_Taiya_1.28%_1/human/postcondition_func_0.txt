The function reads two integers x and n from standard input, finds the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n, and prints this value. The function does not modify the input values x and n, and it does not consume any additional input from standard input beyond the initial two integers. The function's output is a single integer, which is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n.
