Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One example where the program fails is when the input array has a length of 2 and the elements are in decreasing order. In this case, the program will print 'NO' even though the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the two elements.

For example, if the input is:

2
2 1

The program will print 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the two elements.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the array is already sorted or if it can be made sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix. However, it does not consider the case where the array has a length of 2 and the elements are in decreasing order. To fix this issue, the program should add an additional check for this case.
