Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it prints 'YES'.

2. If the array is not sorted, it then checks for each possible split point in the array (from the second element to the second last element) if the array can be sorted by swapping the elements before and after the split point.

3. For each split point, it checks two conditions:
   - If the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements after the split point.
   - If the elements after the split point are sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. If both conditions are met for any split point, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and edge cases, and its logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
