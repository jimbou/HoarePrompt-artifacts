This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n space-separated integers. It checks if the integers are sorted in non-decreasing order. If they are, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if the list can be sorted by removing some elements from the beginning. If it can, it prints 'YES'. If it cannot, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for each test case and then terminates.
