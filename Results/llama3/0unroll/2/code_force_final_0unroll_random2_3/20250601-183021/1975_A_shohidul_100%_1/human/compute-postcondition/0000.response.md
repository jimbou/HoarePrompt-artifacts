The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines of input, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), but the first test case has only one line left which contains n space-separated integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
