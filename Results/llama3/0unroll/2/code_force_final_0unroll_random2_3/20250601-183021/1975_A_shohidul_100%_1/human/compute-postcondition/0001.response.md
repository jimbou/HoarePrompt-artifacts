Output State: **The loop will execute t times, and for each execution, it will read two lines of input from stdin. The first line will contain an integer n, and the second line will contain n space-separated integers a_i. The loop will then check if the list a_i is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the loop will print 'YES'. If it's not, the loop will check if the list can be sorted by removing some elements from the beginning. If it can, the loop will print 'YES'. If it can't, the loop will print 'NO'. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate.**
