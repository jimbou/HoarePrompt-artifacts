The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first line of the input to the variable `t`. The first line of the input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). Therefore, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines of input, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).**
