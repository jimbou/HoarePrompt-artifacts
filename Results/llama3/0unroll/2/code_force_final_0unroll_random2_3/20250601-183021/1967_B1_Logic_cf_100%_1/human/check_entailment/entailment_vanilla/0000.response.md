Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The given program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over all possible values of b from 2 to min(n, m) and adding the number of valid pairs for each b to the total count.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs for each b. The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is not a correct formula for counting the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.
2. The program does not consider the case where b = 1. This is a valid case, and the program should add the number of valid pairs for b = 1 to the total count.
3. The program does not handle the case where n or m is 1 correctly. In this case, the only valid pair is (1, 1), but the program does not correctly count this pair.

Due to these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
