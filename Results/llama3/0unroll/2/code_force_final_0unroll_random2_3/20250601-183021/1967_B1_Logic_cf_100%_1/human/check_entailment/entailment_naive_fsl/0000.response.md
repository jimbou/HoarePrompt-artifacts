Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This line is trying to calculate the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, this calculation is incorrect.

The correct calculation should be `ans = ans + n // b`, because for each `b`, there are `n // b` possible values of `a` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

For example, when `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program outputs `14`, but the correct output should be `19`. The correct pairs are: `(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (9, 1), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 5), (10, 10)`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
