Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function reads a series of lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. Each subsequent line contains two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function calculates a sum of n and the number of multiples of each integer b from 2 to min(n, m) that are less than or equal to n, and prints this sum as a single integer on a new line. The function repeats this process for all t test cases, resulting in t lines of output.**
