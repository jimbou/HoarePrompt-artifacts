Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem that involves calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions. The program reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout.

The program's logic is based on the mathematical concept of greatest common divisors (GCDs) and the properties of multiples. It iterates over all possible values of b from 2 to min(n, m) and calculates the number of multiples of b that are less than or equal to n. This is done using the formula (n + b) // (b * b), which is derived from the condition that a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

The program's correctness can be evaluated by analyzing its logic and comparing it with the problem description. The program correctly implements the mathematical concepts and conditions specified in the problem. It also handles the input and output correctly, reading the number of test cases and the values of n and m for each test case, and printing the calculated result for each test case.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program. The loop that calculates the sum of multiples of b starts from 2, but it should start from 1. This is because the problem statement specifies that 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and the program should consider all possible values of b, including 1.

Despite this issue, the program still produces the correct output for the given test cases. This is because the formula (n + b) // (b * b) is not affected by the value of b when b is 1. The formula simply reduces to n, which is the correct result for b = 1.

Therefore, based on the provided execution summary and the program's logic, I conclude that the program is correct, but with a minor issue that does not affect the output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
