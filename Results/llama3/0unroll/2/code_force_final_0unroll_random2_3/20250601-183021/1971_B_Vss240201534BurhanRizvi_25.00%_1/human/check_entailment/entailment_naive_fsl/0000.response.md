Correctness: **False**.

The program does not guarantee that it will always find a rearrangement of the string that is not equal to the original string. The `random.sample` function is used to generate a random permutation of the string, but there is no guarantee that this permutation will be different from the original string. In fact, if the string has only one unique character, the program will always output "No", even though it is possible to rearrange the string to get the same string (which is not what the problem is asking for).

For example, if the input is "aaaaa", the program will always output "No", but it should output "Yes" and then output "aaaaa" because it is possible to rearrange the string to get the same string.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly.
