Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it successfully implements the required functionality. It reads a series of strings, shuffles each string randomly, and checks if the shuffled string is different from the original string. If it is different, it prints 'Yes' along with the shuffled string; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program uses the `random.sample` function to shuffle the characters in each string, which is an efficient and effective way to generate a random permutation of the characters. The program also correctly handles the case where the shuffled string is the same as the original string, which can occur if the original string has only one unique character or if the random shuffle happens to produce the same string.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing multiple strings and producing the correct output for each one.

Correctness: **True**
