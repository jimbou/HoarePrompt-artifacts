Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a list of strings, where each string is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', indicating the winner of each test case. The number of strings in the list will be equal to the number of test cases, which is the value of the variable t in the initial state.**
