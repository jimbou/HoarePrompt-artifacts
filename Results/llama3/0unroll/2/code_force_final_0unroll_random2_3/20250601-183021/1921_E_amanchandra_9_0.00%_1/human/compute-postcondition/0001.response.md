Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game for multiple test cases, where each test case involves two players, Alice and Bob, with chips placed on a rectangular board. The function takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, which contains the number of test cases and the dimensions of the board along with the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips for each test case. It then analyzes the positions to determine the winner of each test case, printing 'Draw' if the game is a draw, 'Alice' if Alice wins, or 'Bob' if Bob wins. The output is a list of strings, where each string represents the winner of a test case.**
