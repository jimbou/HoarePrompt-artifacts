Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, but they are not in the same column. In this case, the program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can move her chip to the column where Bob's chip is and win the game.

For example, if the input is "4 4 4 1 1 2", the program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice".

The program only checks if Alice's chip is in the last row or Bob's chip is in the first row, but it does not consider the case where they are in different columns. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
