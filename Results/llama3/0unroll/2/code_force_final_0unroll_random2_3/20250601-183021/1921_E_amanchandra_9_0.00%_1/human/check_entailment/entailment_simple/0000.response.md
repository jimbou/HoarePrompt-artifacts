Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `xa > xb`, the program prints 'Draw' because Alice is already in a winning position and cannot lose.

2. If `xa <= xb`, the program calculates the number of moves `x` that Alice needs to make to reach Bob's row.

3. If `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, it means that Alice will make an odd number of moves to reach Bob's row. In this case, the program checks if Bob can move to a position that is at most `x + 1` moves away from Alice's current position. If Bob can make such a move, the program prints 'Alice' because Alice will win. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

4. If `abs(xa - xb)` is even, it means that Alice will make an even number of moves to reach Bob's row. In this case, the program checks if Bob can move to a position that is at most `x` moves away from Alice's current position. If Bob can make such a move, the program prints 'Bob' because Bob will win. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the fact that Alice and Bob move in opposite directions and that the game ends when one player reaches the other player's position or when one player cannot make a move.

Correctness: **True**
