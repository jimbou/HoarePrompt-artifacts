Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are as follows:

- The board has h rows and w columns.
- Alice's chip is initially located at (x_a, y_a), and Bob's chip is initially located at (x_b, y_b).
- Alice can move her chip one cell down, down-right, or down-left (diagonally).
- Bob can move his chip one cell up, up-right, or up-left.
- A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the other player's chip.
- If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in the last row, i.e., x_a = h, Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e., x_b = 1), the game immediately ends in a draw.

The program works as follows:

1. It first checks if Alice's initial position is below Bob's initial position (i.e., xa > xb). If so, it prints 'Draw' because Alice cannot win in this scenario.

2. If Alice's initial position is not below Bob's, it calculates the number of rows (x) that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's row. If the difference in rows is odd, it means that Alice will move to the row above Bob's row. In this case, it calculates the range of columns (l and r) that Bob can move to in the next turn. If Alice's initial column (ya) is within this range, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

3. If the difference in rows is even, it means that Alice will move to the same row as Bob's row. In this case, it calculates the range of columns (l and r) that Alice can move to in the next turn. If Bob's initial column (yb) is within this range, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles all possible scenarios and prints the correct outcome of the game.

Correctness: **True**
