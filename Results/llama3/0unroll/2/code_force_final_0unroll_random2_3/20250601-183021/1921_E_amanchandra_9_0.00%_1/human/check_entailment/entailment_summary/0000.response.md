Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game for each test case based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips on the rectangular board.

The program first checks if Alice's chip is above Bob's chip (xa > xb). If so, it prints 'Draw' because Alice cannot win in this case.

If Alice's chip is not above Bob's chip, the program calculates the number of rows (x) that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's row. If the number of rows is odd, it means that Alice will move diagonally, and the program checks if Alice can reach Bob's chip in the next move. If she can, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

If the number of rows is even, it means that Bob will move diagonally, and the program checks if Bob can reach Alice's chip in the next move. If he can, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct winner for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
