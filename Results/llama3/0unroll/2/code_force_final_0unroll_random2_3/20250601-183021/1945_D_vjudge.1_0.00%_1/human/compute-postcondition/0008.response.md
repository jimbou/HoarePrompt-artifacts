Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum value between the initial value of `resultado` and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and the smallest element in `lista_A` from index `n-k` to `n-1`. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the result to the console. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking.**
