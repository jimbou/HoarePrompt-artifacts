You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers separated by a space, then a space-separated list of integers, and then another space-separated list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer, the second integer is a positive integer and less or equal than the first integer. The two lists of integers have the same length as the first integer and contain positive integers.
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer and less or equal than n, lista_A is a list of positive integers in reverse order, lista_B is a list of positive integers in reverse order, soma_b is the sum of the elements of lista_B from index n-k to n-1, pref is the sum of the elements of lista_A from index 0 to n-k-1 plus the sum of the elements of lista_B from index 0 to n-k-1 that are greater than the corresponding elements in lista_A, stdin is empty
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `resultado` is the minimum value between the initial value of `resultado` and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b` and the smallest element in `lista_A` from index `n-k` to `n-1`, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B`, `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref` and stdin remain unchanged.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: the minimum value between the initial value of resultado and the sum of pref, soma_b, and the smallest element in lista_A from index n-k to n-1

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
