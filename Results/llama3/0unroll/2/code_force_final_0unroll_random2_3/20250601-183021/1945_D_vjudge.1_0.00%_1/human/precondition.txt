stdin contains multiple sets of inputs. Each set contains three lines of inputs: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= m <= n <= 200,000), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). The number of sets is given by an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) in the first line of stdin.
