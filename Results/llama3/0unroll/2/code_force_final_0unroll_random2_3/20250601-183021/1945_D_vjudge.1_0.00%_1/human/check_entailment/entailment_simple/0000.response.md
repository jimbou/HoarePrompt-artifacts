Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The program first reads the input, reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, and initializes the variables `soma_b` and `pref`. It then iterates over the first `n-k` elements of the lists, updating `soma_b` and `pref` accordingly. After that, it iterates over the remaining `k` elements, updating the result `resultado` with the minimum value between the current result and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and the current element of `lista_A`. Finally, it prints the result.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `n` is equal to `k`, and when the input lists are empty. The use of `float('inf')` to initialize the result `resultado` ensures that the minimum value is correctly calculated.

The program also correctly implements the logic of the problem, which is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach the first `m` people in the queue.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
