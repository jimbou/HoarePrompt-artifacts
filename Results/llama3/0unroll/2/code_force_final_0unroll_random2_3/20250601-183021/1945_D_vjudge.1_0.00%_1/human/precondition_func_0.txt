stdin contains three inputs: first two integers separated by a space, then a space-separated list of integers, and then another space-separated list of integers. The first integer is a positive integer, the second integer is a positive integer and less or equal than the first integer. The two lists of integers have the same length as the first integer and contain positive integers.
