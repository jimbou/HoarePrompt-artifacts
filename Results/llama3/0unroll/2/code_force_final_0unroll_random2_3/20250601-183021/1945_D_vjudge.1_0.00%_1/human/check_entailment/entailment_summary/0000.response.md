Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum value between the initial value of `resultado` and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and the smallest element in `lista_A` from index `n-k` to `n-1`. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the result to the console.

`func_2` reads an integer from standard input representing the number of test cases, then calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
