Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to solve the problem. `func_1` takes the input for a single test case and calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in line. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` is correct because it first reverses the input lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` to make it easier to iterate from the end of the queue towards the front. It then initializes variables `soma_b` and `pref` to keep track of the sum of `b` values and the prefix sum of `a` values, respectively.

The program then iterates over the queue from the end towards the front, and for each position, it checks if the `a` value is less than the `b` value. If it is, it adds the prefix sum of `b` values to the prefix sum of `a` values and resets the sum of `b` values. If the `a` value is not less than the `b` value, it simply adds the `b` value to the sum of `b` values.

Finally, the program iterates over the remaining positions in the queue and calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach each position. It keeps track of the minimum result and prints it at the end.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including edge cases where `m` is 1 or `n` is equal to `m`. It also correctly handles cases where the `a` values are all greater than the `b` values or vice versa.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.
