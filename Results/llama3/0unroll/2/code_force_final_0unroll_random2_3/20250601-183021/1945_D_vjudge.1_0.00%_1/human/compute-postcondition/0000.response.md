The code `numero_testes = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numero_testes`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains an integer representing the number of test cases, this integer is assigned to `numero_testes`. The stdin is now empty since the integer has been read.

Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin is empty**
