Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains an integer n followed by n-1 integers. It then processes each line by subtracting the integers from 1000 in reverse order and prints the resulting sequence of integers, one line per input line, with the number of lines equal to the initial value of t.**
