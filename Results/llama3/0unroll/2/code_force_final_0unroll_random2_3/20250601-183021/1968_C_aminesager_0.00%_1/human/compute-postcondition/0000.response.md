The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that the first line of the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). 

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the first line of the standard input. The remaining lines in the standard input are still present, containing `t` lines with `n` integers each.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` lines, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) followed by `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500)**
