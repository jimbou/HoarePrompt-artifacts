Output State: **The output state is a series of lines, each containing a sequence of integers. The number of lines is equal to the initial value of `t`. Each line contains `n` integers, where `n` is the first integer in the corresponding line of the input. The integers in each line are the result of subtracting the corresponding integers in the input line from 1000, in reverse order.**

In natural language, the output state is a series of lines, each containing a sequence of integers. The number of lines is equal to the number of test cases (`t`). Each line contains a sequence of integers, where the first integer is the result of subtracting the first integer in the corresponding input line from 1000, the second integer is the result of subtracting the second integer in the corresponding input line from the first integer, and so on. The integers in each line are in reverse order of the input line.
