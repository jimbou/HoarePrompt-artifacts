Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string, incrementing the count whenever it encounters a change in the character (i.e., from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'). If it encounters a sequence of '0's followed by a sequence of '1's, it decrements the count by 1, because in this case, the string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string with one less piece.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings with only '0's or only '1's, in which case the count is 1.
* Strings with alternating '0's and '1's, in which case the count is equal to the number of changes in the string.
* Strings with sequences of '0's followed by sequences of '1's, in which case the count is decremented by 1.

The program also handles edge cases, such as strings of length 1, in which case the count is 1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut the binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
