This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, it calculates a list of integers based on the values of n and k. If n is 1, the function simply prints the value of k. Otherwise, it calculates a list of integers by finding the largest power of 2 less than k, subtracting the sum of the calculated list from k, and appending zeros to the list until its length is equal to n. The function then prints the calculated list for each test case.
