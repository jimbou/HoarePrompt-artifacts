Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the result of the calculation for each test case. The list will have a length of t, where t is the number of test cases. Each integer in the list will be the result of the calculation (1 << i) - 1 + k - sum(ans), where i is the number of times the while loop iterates, k is the input value, and ans is the list of values calculated in the while loop. The list will be in the format [result1, result2, ..., resultt], where result1, result2, ..., resultt are the results of the calculation for each test case.**
