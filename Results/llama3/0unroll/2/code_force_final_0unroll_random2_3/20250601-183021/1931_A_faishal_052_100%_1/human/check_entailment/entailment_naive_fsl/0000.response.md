Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 48, the program outputs "auz", but the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is actually "aav". 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the encoded word can be represented as the sum of three different letters. In such cases, the program should try all possible combinations of letters and choose the one that is lexicographically smallest. However, the current program only tries to subtract 1, 26, or 26 from the encoded word, which is not sufficient to cover all possible cases. 

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to try all possible combinations of letters and choose the one that is lexicographically smallest.
