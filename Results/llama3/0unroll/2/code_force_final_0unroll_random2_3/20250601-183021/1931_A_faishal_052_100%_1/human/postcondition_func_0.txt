The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts two types of inputs: an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and t integers (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The function then converts each integer into a list of three integers representing the number of 1s, 26s, and the remaining value, respectively. Finally, it prints a list of strings, where each string contains three characters representing the number of 1s, 26s, and the remaining value, respectively, for each test case. The characters are represented as lowercase letters, where 'a' represents 1, 'z' represents 26, and so on.
