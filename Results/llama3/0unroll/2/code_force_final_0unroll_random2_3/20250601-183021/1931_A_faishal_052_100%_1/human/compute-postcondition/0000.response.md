Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t integers (3 ≤ n ≤ 78)**

In this output state, the value of `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, which is the value read from the first input in stdin. The variable `info` is an empty list, as it was initialized as such in the code. Stdin now contains t integers, where t is the value of `cases`, and each integer is between 3 and 78, as specified in the initial state.
