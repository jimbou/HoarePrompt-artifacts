Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly determines the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded from the given integer.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads an integer (`lex`) representing the encoded word.
3.  The program then constructs a list (`arr`) to store the three letters of the decoded word. It does this by iterating over the possible values of the first two letters (1 and 26) and subtracting them from `lex` until `lex` is less than 28.
4.  After constructing the list `arr`, the program sorts it in ascending order to ensure that the letters are in lexicographically smallest order.
5.  Finally, the program converts each integer in `arr` to its corresponding lowercase letter by adding 96 (the ASCII value of 'a' - 1) and prints the resulting string.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing the input correctly and producing the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
