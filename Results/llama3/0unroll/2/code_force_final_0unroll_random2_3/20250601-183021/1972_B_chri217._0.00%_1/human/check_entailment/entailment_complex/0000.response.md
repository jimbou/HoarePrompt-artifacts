Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win the game if both players play optimally. The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The provided function, `func_1`, takes a string `s` as input and returns 'YES' if the number of 'U's (facing-up coins) is odd and 'NO' if it's even. This is based on the observation that if there is an odd number of 'U's, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of 'U's, forcing him to make a move that leaves Alice with an odd number of 'U's again. This pattern continues until there are no 'U's left, at which point Alice wins.

The function correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U's in the input string and returning 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if it's even.

Correctness: **True**
