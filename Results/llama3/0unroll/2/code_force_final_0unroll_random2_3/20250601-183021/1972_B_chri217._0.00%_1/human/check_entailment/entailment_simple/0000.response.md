Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly determines who will win the game based on the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of facing-up coins, forcing him to make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of facing-up coins, and so on.

The program correctly counts the number of facing-up coins using the `count` method of the string `s`, and then uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the count is odd or even. If it's odd, the program returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win, and if it's even, the program returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win.

Correctness: **True**
