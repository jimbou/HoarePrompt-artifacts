Output State: **`s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D", `num_up` is the number of "U"s in `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `num_up` is equal to the number of "U"s in the string `s`. The length of `s` is still between 1 and 100, and it only contains the characters "U" and "D". The value of `num_up` is a specific count of the "U"s in `s`, which can be any integer between 0 and n.
