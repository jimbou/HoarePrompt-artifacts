Output State: **The output state is a series of pairs of lists, where each pair represents the result of a test case. Each list contains the rearranged elements from the input lists a and b, such that the first list contains the elements from a and the second list contains the elements from b. The rearrangement is done in a way that the first and last elements of each list are unique, and the remaining elements are paired up in ascending order. The number of pairs is determined by the value of k.**
