Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array `a` has a length of 2n, where n is an odd number, and the first and last elements of the first half of the array are the same, but not equal to the first and last elements of the second half of the array.

For example, if the input is:

```
1
3 1
1 2 3 3 2 1
```

The program will output:

```
3
3
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
1 2
3 2
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the first and last elements of the first half of the array are the same, but not equal to the first and last elements of the second half of the array.

The program only checks if the first and last elements of the first half of the array are different, and if they are, it adds them to the list `l`. However, it does not check if these elements are equal to the first and last elements of the second half of the array. As a result, the program may not correctly find the subsets `l` and `r` that satisfy the condition that the bitwise XOR of elements of `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of `r`.
