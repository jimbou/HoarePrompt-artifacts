Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function rearranges the integers in the second line into two lists, ensuring that the first and last elements of each list are unique and the remaining elements are paired up in ascending order. The number of pairs is determined by the value of k. The function then prints the rearranged lists for each test case.**
