Precondition: **stdin contains a series of test cases. Each test case consists of four parts: 

1. An integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5) 
2. A list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9) 
3. An integer m (1 <= m <= 10^5) 
4. A list of m pairs of integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n; x_i != y_i). 

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
