Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input data for each test case, including the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities `a`, and the number of queries `m`.
2.  It initializes the `b` array with the correct values, where `b[i*2]` and `b[i*2+1]` represent the minimum cost to reach the `i-th` city from the left and right, respectively.
3.  The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to reach each city from its closest neighbor. It uses the fact that the closest city is unique and that the distance between two cities is the absolute difference between their coordinates.
4.  For each query, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to travel from the source city to the destination city. It uses the precomputed values in the `b` array to calculate the cost in constant time.
5.  The program handles the cases where the source city is to the left or right of the destination city correctly, by subtracting the corresponding values from the `b` array.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
