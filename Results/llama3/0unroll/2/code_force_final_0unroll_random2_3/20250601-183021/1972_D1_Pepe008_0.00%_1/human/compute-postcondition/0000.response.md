Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**

In this output state, `T` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers n and m, with the same constraints as before. The values of n and m are not affected by this code, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases still do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
