Output State: **The output state is the sum of the number of pairs (i, j) for each test case, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to a, and j is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to b, such that (j+i) is divisible by the greatest common divisor of i and j. The sum is calculated for each test case and printed as the output.**
