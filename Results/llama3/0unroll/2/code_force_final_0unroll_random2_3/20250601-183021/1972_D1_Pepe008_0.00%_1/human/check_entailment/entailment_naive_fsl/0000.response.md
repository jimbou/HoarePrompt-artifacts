Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line where it calculates `x`. The formula used is incorrect and does not accurately represent the number of valid pairs for a given `i`.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if the conditions are met. However, this would be inefficient for large inputs. A more efficient approach would involve using the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the fact that `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

A correct solution would involve calculating the number of valid pairs for each possible value of `gcd(a, b)` and then summing them up. This would require a more complex algorithm that takes into account the properties of GCD and the conditions given in the problem.

For example, for the input `n = 10, m = 8`, the program outputs `13`, but the correct output is `14`. This is because the program is not correctly calculating the number of valid pairs.
