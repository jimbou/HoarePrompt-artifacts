This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two positive integers 'a' and 'b'. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the number of pairs (i, j) where 'i' is a positive integer less than or equal to 'a' and 'j' is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 'b', such that (j+i) is divisible by the greatest common divisor of 'i' and 'j'. The function then prints the calculated sum minus one for each test case.
