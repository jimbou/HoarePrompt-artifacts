Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a specific problem, which involves calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two positive integers 'a' and 'b'. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the number of pairs (i, j) where 'i' is a positive integer less than or equal to 'a' and 'j' is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 'b', such that (j+i) is divisible by the greatest common divisor of 'i' and 'j'. The program then prints the calculated sum minus one for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program is subtracting 1 from the calculated sum, which is incorrect. The correct solution should not subtract 1 from the sum.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
