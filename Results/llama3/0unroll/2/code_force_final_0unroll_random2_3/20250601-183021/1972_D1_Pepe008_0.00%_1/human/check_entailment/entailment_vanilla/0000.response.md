Reasoning:

The problem asks us to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b \* gcd(a, b)

The given Python program attempts to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases T and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads two integers n and m.
3.  The program then calculates the sum of valid pairs (a, b) using a single loop that iterates over the range 1 to b (inclusive).
4.  Inside the loop, it calculates x as (a - i \* (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1. This expression seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid pairs for a given i.
5.  If a - i \* (i - 1) is greater than 0, it adds x to the sum.
6.  Finally, it prints the sum minus 1.

However, there are several issues with the program:

*   The loop only iterates over the range 1 to b, but it should iterate over the range 1 to m (as specified in the problem statement).
*   The calculation of x is incorrect. It seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid pairs for a given i, but it does not take into account the gcd(a, b) condition.
*   The program subtracts 1 from the sum before printing it, but there is no clear reason for this subtraction.

Due to these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
