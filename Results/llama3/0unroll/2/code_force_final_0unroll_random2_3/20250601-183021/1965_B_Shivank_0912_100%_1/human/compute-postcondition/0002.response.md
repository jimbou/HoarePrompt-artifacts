Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k, and generates a list of numbers from 1 to 2^20 (excluding 2^i), where i is the largest integer such that 2^i is less than or equal to k. The list is ordered, with the first three numbers being k - 2^i, k + 1, and k + 1 + 2^i, respectively. The function then prints the length of the list followed by its elements. This process is repeated for each of the t test cases.**
