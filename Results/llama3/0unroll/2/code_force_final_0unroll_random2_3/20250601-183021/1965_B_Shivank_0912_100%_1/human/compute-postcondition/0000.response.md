The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n). After accepting the first integer, the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n).**
