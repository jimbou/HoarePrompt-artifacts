Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum element in the permutation and its index. The program first finds the maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum element. Once the maximum element is found, it finds its index by comparing each element with the maximum element. The program then prints the index and the maximum element to standard output.

The program uses at most 3n queries, where n is the number of elements in the permutation. This is because the program uses a binary search approach, which reduces the search space by half in each iteration. The program also uses a single query to find the maximum element and its index, which reduces the number of queries required.

The program also handles the case where the maximum element is not unique. In this case, the program will print the index and the maximum element of the first occurrence of the maximum element.

Therefore, the given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
