Output State: **stdin contains no input, I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer**.

The code defines two lambda functions, I and R. The I function takes no arguments and returns a list of integers by reading a line from stdin, splitting it into a list of strings using space as a delimiter, and then converting each string to an integer using the map function. The R function takes no arguments and returns an integer by reading a line from stdin and converting it to an integer. After the code executes, stdin is empty because the input function is called twice, once for each lambda function. The I and R functions are defined and can be used to read input from stdin.
