Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are well-defined in the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases (`tt`), the dimensions of the board (`n` and `m`), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`).
2.  The program defines a function `func_1()` to handle each test case. This function takes no arguments and uses the globally defined variables.
3.  Within `func_1()`, the program first checks if Bob's chip is at a higher row than Alice's chip (`x2 <= x1`). If this condition is true, the game is a draw, and the program prints "draw" and returns.
4.  The program then checks if the difference between Bob's and Alice's row positions (`x2 - x1`) is odd. If it is, the program performs a series of calculations to determine the outcome of the game.
5.  If the difference is odd, the program checks if Alice's and Bob's chips are in the same column (`y1 == y2`). If they are, Alice wins, and the program prints "Alice" and returns.
6.  If Alice's and Bob's chips are not in the same column, the program calculates the number of columns (`a`) that Bob's chip needs to move to reach the same column as Alice's chip. It then updates the positions of both chips accordingly.
7.  After updating the positions, the program checks if the game is a draw by verifying if Bob's chip is at the same row as Alice's chip or if either chip is out of the board's boundaries. If the game is a draw, the program prints "draw" and returns.
8.  If the game is not a draw, the program checks if Alice can win by verifying if the number of rows (`b`) that Bob's chip needs to move is greater than the number of columns (`a`) that Bob's chip moved. If Alice can win, the program prints "Alice" and returns.
9.  If Alice cannot win, the program prints "draw" and returns.
10. If the difference between Bob's and Alice's row positions is even, the program performs a similar series of calculations to determine the outcome of the game. However, in this case, Bob wins if the conditions are met.
11. The program handles all possible scenarios and constraints defined in the problem description.

Based on this analysis, the given Python program is correct and should produce the expected output for the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
