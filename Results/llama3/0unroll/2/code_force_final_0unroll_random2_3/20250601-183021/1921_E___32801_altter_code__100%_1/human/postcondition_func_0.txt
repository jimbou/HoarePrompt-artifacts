This function determines the winner of a game based on the input values of h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b, where h and w represent the dimensions of a grid, and x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b represent the positions of two players. The function prints 'draw' if x_b is less than or equal to x_a, 'Alice' if the difference between x_b and x_a is odd and y_a is equal to y_b, and 'bob' if the difference between x_b and x_a is even and y_a is equal to y_b. In all cases, the function does not return any value.
