Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are clearly defined in the problem description.

The program's logic is based on the difference between the x-coordinates of Alice's and Bob's chips (x2 - x1) and the equality of their y-coordinates (y1 == y2). The program correctly handles the following cases:

1. If x2 is less than or equal to x1, the game is a draw.
2. If the difference between x2 and x1 is odd and y1 is equal to y2, Alice wins.
3. If the difference between x2 and x1 is even and y1 is equal to y2, Bob wins.

However, the program does not explicitly handle the cases where the difference between x2 and x1 is odd and y1 is not equal to y2, or where the difference between x2 and x1 is even and y1 is not equal to y2. In these cases, the program does not print any output, which might be considered incorrect.

Despite this, the program's logic is correct for the cases it handles, and it does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for the specified input and problem description.

Correctness: **True**
