Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the input values of h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b. The program checks for the conditions where Alice or Bob wins, and if none of those conditions are met, it prints 'draw'. The program also handles the cases where the difference between x_b and x_a is odd or even, and where y_a is equal to y_b. The program does not return any value, but it correctly prints the result of the game.

Correctness: **True**
