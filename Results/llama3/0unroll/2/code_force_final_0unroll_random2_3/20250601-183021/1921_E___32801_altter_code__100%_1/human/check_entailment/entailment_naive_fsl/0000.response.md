Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column and Alice is in the last row. In this case, Alice cannot move and the game should end in a draw, but the program does not check for this condition.

For example, if the input is:

6 5 6 2 5 2

The program will output "Alice" instead of "Draw".
