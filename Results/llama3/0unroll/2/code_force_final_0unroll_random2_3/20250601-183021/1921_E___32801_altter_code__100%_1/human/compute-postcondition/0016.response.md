Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement with a value. The program simply ends after printing 'bob' and processing the test cases. The values of n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2, and r remain unchanged, and the difference between x2 and x1 remains even. The current value of y1 remains equal to the current value of y2.**
