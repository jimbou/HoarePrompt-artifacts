Output State: **The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2, and r remain unchanged. The difference between x2 and x1 is still odd, and y1 and y2 are still equal. The program has printed 'Alice' to the standard output. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.**
