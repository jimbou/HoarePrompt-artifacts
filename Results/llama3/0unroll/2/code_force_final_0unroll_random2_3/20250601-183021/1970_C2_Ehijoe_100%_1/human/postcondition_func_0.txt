Determines if there is a neighboring node of a given start node in a tree that has a certain property, specifically the opposite of the return value of `func_1(nodes, node, start)`. The function takes as input a list of lists representing the neighboring nodes of each node in the tree, a start node, and a parent node. It returns True if at least one neighboring node of the start node (excluding the parent node) has the opposite property, and False otherwise. If the start node has only one neighboring node which is the parent node, the function immediately returns False.
