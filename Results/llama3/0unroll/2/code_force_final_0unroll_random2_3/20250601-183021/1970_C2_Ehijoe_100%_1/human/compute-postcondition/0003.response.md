Output State: **nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, start is an integer representing the starting node, n and t are integers, edges is an empty list, empty is True, leaves is an empty deque**

In this output state, the code creates an empty deque called `leaves`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state still includes the initial state's information about `nodes`, `start`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `empty`. The only addition is the new variable `leaves`, which is an empty deque.
