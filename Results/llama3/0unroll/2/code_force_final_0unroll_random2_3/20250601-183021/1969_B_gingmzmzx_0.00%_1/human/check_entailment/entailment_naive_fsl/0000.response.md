Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input string is "101", the program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. This is because the program is counting the number of operations needed to move all the 1's to the right of all the 0's, but it is not considering the case where a single operation can move all the 1's to the right of all the 0's.

In this case, a single operation can move the first 1 to the right of the 0, resulting in the string "011", which is sorted in non-descending order. Therefore, the minimum total cost to make the string sorted is 1, not 2.

The program is incorrect because it is not considering all possible cases and is not finding the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.
