Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 binary strings s (2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; s_i in {0, 1}).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-1 binary strings s, where each string has a length between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
