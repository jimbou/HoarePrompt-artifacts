Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by counting the number of pairs of adjacent 0s and 1s in the string. The program uses a clever approach by maintaining a count of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far, and updating the answer accordingly. The time complexity of the program is O(n), where n is the length of the binary string, which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
