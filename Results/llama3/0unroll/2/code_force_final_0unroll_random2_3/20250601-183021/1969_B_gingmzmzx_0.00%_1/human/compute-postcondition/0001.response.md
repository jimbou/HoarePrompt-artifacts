Output State: **The loop will execute n times, and in each iteration, it will read a binary string s from the standard input, calculate the number of zeroes in the string, and then iterate over the string to calculate the number of pairs of adjacent 0s and 1s. The result will be printed to the standard output. After all iterations, the loop will finish, and the program will terminate. The value of n will be unchanged, and the standard input will be empty.**
