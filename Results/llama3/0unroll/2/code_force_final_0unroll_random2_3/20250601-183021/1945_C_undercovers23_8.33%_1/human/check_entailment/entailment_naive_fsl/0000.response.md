Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid. It iterates through the string `s` and keeps track of the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the road. It checks if the percentage of zeros on the left side and ones on the right side is greater than or equal to 50%. If it is, it adds the current position to the list `lst`. Then, it finds the minimum absolute difference between the middle of the village and the positions in `lst`. Finally, it prints the smallest position with the minimum absolute difference.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including when the number of houses is even or odd, and when the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house. The program also correctly handles the case when there are multiple suitable positions with the minimum absolute difference, and it prints the smallest one.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
