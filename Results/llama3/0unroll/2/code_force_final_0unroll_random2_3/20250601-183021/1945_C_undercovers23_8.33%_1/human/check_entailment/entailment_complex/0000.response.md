Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum index where the percentage of zeros to the left and ones to the right are both greater than or equal to 50%. The program handles the edge cases where no such index exists and prints 0 if the overall percentage of ones is greater than or equal to 50%, and n if it's less than 50%.

The program uses a list to store the indices that satisfy the condition and then finds the minimum index that is closest to the middle of the village. The program also handles the case where there are multiple suitable positions with the minimum distance to the middle of the village and outputs the smaller one.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
