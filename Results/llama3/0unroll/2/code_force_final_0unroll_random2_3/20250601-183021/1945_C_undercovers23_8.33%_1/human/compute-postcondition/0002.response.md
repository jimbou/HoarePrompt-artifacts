Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string a of length n containing only 0s and 1s. For each test case, it calculates the minimum index where the percentage of zeros to the left and ones to the right are both greater than or equal to 50%. If no such index exists, it prints 0 if the overall percentage of ones is greater than or equal to 50%, and n if it's less than 50%. The function prints the result for each test case, leaving the state of other variables unchanged.**
