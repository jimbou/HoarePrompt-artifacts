Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid, as described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly calculates the middle index `pk` of the village, considering both even and odd lengths.
2.  It accurately counts the total number of zeros `z` and ones `o` in the village.
3.  The program then iterates through the village, maintaining a count of zeros `zero` and ones `one` to the left of the current position.
4.  For each position, it calculates the percentage of zeros to the left `zero_perc` and ones to the right `one_perc` and checks if both percentages are greater than or equal to 50%.
5.  If the condition is met, the program adds the current position `i + 1` to the list `lst`.
6.  After iterating through the entire village, the program finds the minimum absolute difference `mini` between the middle index `pk` and the positions in `lst`.
7.  It then creates a new list `final` containing the positions with the minimum absolute difference.
8.  If no such position is found (i.e., `final` is empty), the program checks the overall percentage of ones `c1` in the village. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50%, it adds 0 to `final`; otherwise, it adds `n`.
9.  Finally, the program prints the smallest position in `final`, which represents the minimum index where the percentage of zeros to the left and ones to the right are both greater than or equal to 50%.

Correctness: **True**
