Output State: **The loop will print the minimum index where the percentage of zeros to the left and ones to the right are both greater than or equal to 50%, for each test case. If no such index exists, it will print 0 if the overall percentage of ones is greater than or equal to 50%, and n if it's less than 50%. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.**
