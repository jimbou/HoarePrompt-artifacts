Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when x = 1 and y = 1, the program prints 1, but the correct answer is 1. However, when x = 7 and y = 2, the program prints 1, but the correct answer is 1. But when x = 15 and y = 0, the program prints 1, but the correct answer is 1.
