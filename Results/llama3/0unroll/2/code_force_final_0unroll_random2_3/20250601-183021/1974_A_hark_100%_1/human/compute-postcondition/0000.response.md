Output State: **`ap` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `ap` is assigned the integer value from the first input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), as the first input has been consumed.
