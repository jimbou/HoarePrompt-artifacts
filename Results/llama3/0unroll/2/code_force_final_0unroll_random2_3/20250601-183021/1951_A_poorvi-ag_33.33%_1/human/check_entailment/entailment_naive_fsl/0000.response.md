Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the number of '1's in the binary string is 0. In this case, the program should print "YES" because the configuration can be reached by not performing any operations. However, the program does not explicitly handle this case and will print "NO" instead.

For example, if the input is:

1
5
00000

The program will print "NO", but the correct output should be "YES".
