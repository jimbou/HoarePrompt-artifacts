Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50).**

Explanation: The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` is the number of test cases, it can be any integer between 1 and 1000. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one test case has been processed, leaving multiple test cases minus one.
