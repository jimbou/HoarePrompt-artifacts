#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000). The second line contains a binary string s of size n (1 <= n <= 50).
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        
        if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:
                results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable t is still an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is a list of strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the conditions met in the loop, and stdin is empty because all test cases have been processed.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: Output State: The variable r is undefined because it was only defined in the loop head, results is still a list of strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no', and stdin is still empty because all test cases have been processed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then evaluates the binary string based on two conditions: if the string contains exactly two '1's and they are adjacent, or if the total count of '1's is even. If either condition is met, it appends 'yes' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, it prints each result to standard output. The function does not modify the input variables, and its output is a list of 'yes' or 'no' strings indicating whether each test case met the specified conditions.
