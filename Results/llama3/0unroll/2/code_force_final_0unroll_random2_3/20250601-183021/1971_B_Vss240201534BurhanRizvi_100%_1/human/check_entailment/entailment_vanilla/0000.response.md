Reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the length of the input string `s` is 1. If it is, it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

2. If the length of `s` is more than 1, it checks if all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`). If they are, it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange the characters to form a different string.

3. If the length of `s` is more than 1 and not all characters are the same, it generates a random permutation of `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. If the generated permutation is the same as the original string `s`, it rearranges `s` by moving the first character to the end.

4. In all cases where a rearrangement is possible, it prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string.

Based on the provided problem description and the given program, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
