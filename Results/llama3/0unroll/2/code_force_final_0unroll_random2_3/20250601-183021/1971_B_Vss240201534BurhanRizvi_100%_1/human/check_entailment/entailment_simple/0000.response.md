Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. It correctly handles the case where the input string `s` has a length of 1, in which case it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that's not equal to `s`. In this case, it prints "No".

2. It correctly handles the case where all characters in the input string `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`). In this case, it's also impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that's not equal to `s`, so it prints "No".

3. For all other cases, it uses the `random.sample` function to randomly rearrange the characters in the input string `s`. If the rearranged string `s2` happens to be the same as the original string `s` (which is possible but unlikely), it uses a simple rotation to ensure that `s2` is different from `s`.

4. Finally, it prints "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
