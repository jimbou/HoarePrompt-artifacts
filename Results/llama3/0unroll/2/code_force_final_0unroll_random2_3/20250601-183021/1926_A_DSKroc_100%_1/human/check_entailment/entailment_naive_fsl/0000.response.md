Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the most frequent letter in a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It initializes counters for 'A' and 'B' to 0, then iterates over the string, incrementing the appropriate counter for each letter. Finally, it prints the letter with the higher count. This approach correctly handles all possible cases, including ties, where the program will print 'B' if the counts are equal.
