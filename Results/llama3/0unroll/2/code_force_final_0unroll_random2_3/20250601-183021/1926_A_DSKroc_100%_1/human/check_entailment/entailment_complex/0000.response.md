Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately solves the problem as described. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the letter that appears most frequently.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, and vice versa. It also correctly handles the case where the number of 'A's is equal to the number of 'B's, in which case it prints 'B' as per the problem description.

The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical errors, and it produces the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
