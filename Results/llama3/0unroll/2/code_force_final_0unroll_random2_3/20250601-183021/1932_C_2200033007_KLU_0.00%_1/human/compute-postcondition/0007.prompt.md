You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'.
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list b contains the elements of a in the order they appear from left to right for 'L' characters in s and from right to left for 'R' characters in s. The value of l is n and the value of r is -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: The list ans contains the cumulative product of the elements of b in reverse order, starting from the rightmost element. The value of p is the product of all elements in b. The values of l and r remain unchanged, with l still being n and r still being -1.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list ans in reverse order, where ans contains the cumulative product of the elements of b in reverse order, starting from the rightmost element. The list is reversed, but the values of l and r remain unchanged, with l still being n and r still being -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list ans in reverse order, where ans contains the cumulative product of the elements of b in reverse order, starting from the rightmost element. The list is reversed, but the values of l and r remain unchanged, with l still being n and r still being -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
