Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by processing the commands in the string `s` and calculating the remainder of the product of the elements in the array `a` after each command.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly initializes the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` based on the input.
2. The function `func_1` correctly rearranges the elements of `a` based on the string `s`, placing elements corresponding to 'L' characters from left to right and elements corresponding to 'R' characters from right to left.
3. The function correctly calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged elements in reverse order and stores it in the list `ans`.
4. The function correctly returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which represents the remainder of the product of the elements in the array `a` after each command.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
