Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem requires the program to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at the beginning of the execution of each command. However, the program calculates the product of the elements in the reversed order of the commands, which is not the same as the product of all elements at the beginning of each command.

For example, consider the input `n = 3, m = 2, a = [1, 2, 3], s = "LRL"`. The correct output should be `[6, 2, 1]`, but the program outputs `[3, 2, 1]`. This is because the program calculates the product of the elements in the reversed order of the commands, which is `[3, 2, 1]`, instead of the product of all elements at the beginning of each command, which is `[6, 2, 1]`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
