#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters, each of which is either 'L' or 'R'.
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list b contains the elements of a in the order they appear from left to right for 'L' characters in s and from right to left for 'R' characters in s. The value of l is n and the value of r is -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: The list ans contains the cumulative product of the elements of b in reverse order, starting from the rightmost element. The value of p is the product of all elements in b. The values of l and r remain unchanged, with l still being n and r still being -1.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list ans in reverse order, where ans contains the cumulative product of the elements of b in reverse order, starting from the rightmost element. The list is reversed, but the values of l and r remain unchanged, with l still being n and r still being -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes as input a list of positive integers and a string of the same length, where each character is either 'L' or 'R'. It rearranges the integers based on the string, placing elements corresponding to 'L' characters from left to right and elements corresponding to 'R' characters from right to left. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged integers in reverse order and returns this product as a list in reverse order.
