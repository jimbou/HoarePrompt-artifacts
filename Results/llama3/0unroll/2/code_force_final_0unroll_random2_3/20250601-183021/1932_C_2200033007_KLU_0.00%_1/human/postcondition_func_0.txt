This function takes as input a list of positive integers and a string of the same length, where each character is either 'L' or 'R'. It rearranges the integers based on the string, placing elements corresponding to 'L' characters from left to right and elements corresponding to 'R' characters from right to left. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged integers in reverse order and returns this product as a list in reverse order.
