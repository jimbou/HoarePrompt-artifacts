This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It then processes each test case to find the number of integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set cx, where bx is the maximum x value for a=1, ax is the minimum x value for a=2, and cx is the set of x values for a=3. The function prints the result for each test case on a separate line.
