Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the minimum and maximum values of k (bx and ax) with the maximum and minimum possible values, respectively. Then, it iterates over each constraint, updating bx and ax accordingly. If a constraint is of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), it adds x to a set cx. After processing all constraints, it checks if bx is greater than or equal to ax, in which case there are no valid values for k, and appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid values for k by subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of values in the range (ax - bx + 1). This logic correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where there are no valid values for k or where the constraints are inconsistent.
