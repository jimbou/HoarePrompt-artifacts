Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then iterates over each constraint.
3.  It correctly handles the three types of constraints:

    *   For type 1 constraints (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates the minimum possible value of k (`bx`) to be the maximum of the current `bx` and the given `x`.
    *   For type 2 constraints (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates the maximum possible value of k (`ax`) to be the minimum of the current `ax` and the given `x`.
    *   For type 3 constraints (k must not be equal to x), it adds the given `x` to the set `cx`.
4.  After processing all constraints, it checks if the minimum possible value of k (`bx`) is greater than or equal to the maximum possible value of k (`ax`). If so, it means there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
5.  Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of k that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the number of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of values in the range `[bx, ax]`. It appends this result to the list `r`.
6.  Finally, it prints the results for each test case on separate lines.

Correctness: **True**
