Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of two integers `a` and `x`.
2.  It initializes variables `cx` as a set to store the x values for constraints of type 3 (k must be not equal to x), `ax` as the minimum x value for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and `bx` as the maximum x value for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x).
3.  For each constraint, it updates `bx` and `ax` accordingly based on the constraint type. If the constraint type is 3, it adds the x value to the set `cx`.
4.  After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no integers that satisfy all constraints, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
5.  Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx` by subtracting the count of integers in `cx` that fall within this range from the total count of integers in the range (`ax - bx + 1`). This result is appended to the list `r`.
6.  Finally, it prints the results for each test case on separate lines.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
