This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n (the number of elements), k, and x (the number of elements to remove in each iteration). The second line contains n integers representing the array elements. The function sorts the array in descending order, then iterates k+1 times, calculating the sum of the remaining elements after removing 2*x elements in each iteration. The function outputs the maximum sum obtained among all iterations for each test case.
