Output State: **The output state will be the maximum sum of the array elements after removing 2*x elements from the array, where x is the number of elements to be removed in each iteration, and the array is sorted in descending order. The maximum sum is calculated for each iteration of the loop, and the final output is the maximum sum among all iterations.**
