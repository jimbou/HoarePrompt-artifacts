Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will output "YES", but it should output "NO" because it is not possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the current element is less than the previous element, and if so, it tries to split the previous element into digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. However, this approach is not sufficient to cover all possible cases.

A correct approach would be to iterate through the array from left to right, and for each element, check if it is greater than or equal to the previous element. If it is not, then try to split the current element into digits and check if the resulting array is sorted. If it is not sorted, then return "NO". If the entire array is iterated through without finding any issues, then return "YES".

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(1, m):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i])] + [arr[i - 1]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

This implementation correctly checks all possible cases and returns the correct output.
