Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It iterates through the array from right to left, checking if the current element is less than the previous one. If it is, it splits the previous element into its digits and checks if the resulting array is sorted. If it's not, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. If the loop completes without finding any unsorted arrays, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This approach correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
