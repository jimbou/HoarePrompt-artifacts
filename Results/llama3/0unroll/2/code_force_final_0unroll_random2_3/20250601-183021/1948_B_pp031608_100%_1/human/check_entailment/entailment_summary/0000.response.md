Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times. The program iterates through the array from right to left, and whenever it encounters a pair of elements that are not in non-decreasing order, it checks if the digits of the previous element can be rearranged to be in non-decreasing order with the current element. If this is not possible, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case. If it successfully checks all pairs of elements without finding any that cannot be rearranged, it prints 'YES'. This logic is correct and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
