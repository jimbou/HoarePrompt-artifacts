Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. 1 <= t <= 10^3, 2 <= n <= 50, and 0 <= a_i <= 99.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer between 2 and 50, which is the first line of the current test case. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of t, n, and a_i are still within their respective ranges.
