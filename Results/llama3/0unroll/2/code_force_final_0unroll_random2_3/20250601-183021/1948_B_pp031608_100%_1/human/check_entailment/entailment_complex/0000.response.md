Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by applying the specified operation any number of times.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements `arr`.
3.  It initializes a flag `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.
4.  The program then iterates over the array from the second last element to the first element (in reverse order).
5.  If it finds a pair of elements where the current element is less than the previous element, it checks if the previous element can be split into digits to form a sorted subarray.
6.  If the subarray is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks the loop.
7.  After checking all pairs of elements, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is still `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and follows the problem's constraints. It also uses efficient logic to check if the array can be sorted, making it a correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
