This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints whether each test case's array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by reversing a subarray. It iterates through each test case, checks if the array can be sorted by reversing a subarray, and prints 'YES' if possible and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not modify the input array or store any results; it only prints the outcome for each test case.
