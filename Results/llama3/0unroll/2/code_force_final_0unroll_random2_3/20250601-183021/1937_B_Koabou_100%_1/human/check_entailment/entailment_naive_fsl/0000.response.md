Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One case where it fails is when the input grid has a row of zeros in the first row and a row of ones in the second row, except for the last column, which is zero in both rows. In this case, the program will incorrectly output the string of zeros from the first row and the last column, instead of the lexicographically smallest string, which is the string of zeros from the first row and the second row.

For example, if the input is:

3
4
0000
1110

The program will output:

0000
1

Instead of the correct output:

0000
4

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the first row has a string of zeros and the second row has a string of ones, except for the last column.
