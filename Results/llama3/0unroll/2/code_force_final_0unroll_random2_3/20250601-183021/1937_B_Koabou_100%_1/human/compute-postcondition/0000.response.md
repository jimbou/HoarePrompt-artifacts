Output State: **a is an empty list, n is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains two binary strings of length n.**

The first line creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `a`. The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `n` is the first input from stdin, it takes the value of the first integer from the test case. The remaining two binary strings of length `n` are still in stdin, waiting to be read.
