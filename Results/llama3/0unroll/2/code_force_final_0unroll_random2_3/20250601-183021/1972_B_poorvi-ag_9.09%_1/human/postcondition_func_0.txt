This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines for each test case whether the string can be made valid by flipping some characters, and prints 'yes' if possible and 'no' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the order they were received.
