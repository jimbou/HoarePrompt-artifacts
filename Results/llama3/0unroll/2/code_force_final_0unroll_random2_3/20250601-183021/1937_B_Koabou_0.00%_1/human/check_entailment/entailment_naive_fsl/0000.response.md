Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not a prefix of the first row. For example, consider the input:

3
2
11
00

The program will output "1100" as the lexicographically smallest string, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "0011".

The issue is that the program only checks if the first row has a '1' followed by a '0' in the second row, and if so, it breaks and constructs the string. However, this does not cover all cases, and the program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not a prefix of the first row.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle all cases and find the lexicographically smallest string.
