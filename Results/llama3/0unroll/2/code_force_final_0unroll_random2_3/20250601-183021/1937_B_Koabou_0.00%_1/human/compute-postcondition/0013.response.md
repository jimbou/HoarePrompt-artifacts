Functionality: **This function reads two binary strings of the same length from standard input, attempts to find a prefix of the first string that matches a suffix of the second string, and prints the resulting concatenated string and the length of the longest matching prefix. If no matching prefix is found, it prints the concatenated string and 1.**
