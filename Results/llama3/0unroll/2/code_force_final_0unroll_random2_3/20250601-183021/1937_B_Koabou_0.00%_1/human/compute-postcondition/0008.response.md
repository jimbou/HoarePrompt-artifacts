Output State: The list s contains a binary string of length 2n, x is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), a is a list containing two binary strings of length n, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and t is the maximum value of x - i + 1 for which a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1] holds true, or 1 if no such i is found.
