Output State: **a is an empty list, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains two binary strings a and b of length n.**

The first line initializes an empty list `a`. The second line reads an integer `n` from the input, which is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and assigns it to the variable `n`. This line also consumes one test case from the input, leaving multiple test cases minus one. The remaining test cases each contain two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`.
