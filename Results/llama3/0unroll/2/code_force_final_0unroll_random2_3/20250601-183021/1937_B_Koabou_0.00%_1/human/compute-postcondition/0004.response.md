Output State: The list s contains a binary string of length n, where the first i elements are from the first binary string in a, and the remaining elements are from the second binary string in a. The value of x is i, which is the index where the loop broke. If the loop did not break, s contains the first binary string in a concatenated with the last character of the second binary string in a, and x is n - 1.
