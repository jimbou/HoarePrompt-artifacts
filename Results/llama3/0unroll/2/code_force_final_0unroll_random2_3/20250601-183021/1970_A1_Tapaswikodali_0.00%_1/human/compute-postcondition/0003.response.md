Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, balance is 0, details is a sorted list of tuples containing the balance, negative index, and character at each position in the string s, result is a string containing the characters from s in the order specified by the sorted details list.**

The code sorts the list of tuples in the `details` variable based on the balance, negative index, and character at each position in the string `s`. Then, it creates a new string `result` by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list. The `balance` variable remains unchanged, and the `s` variable also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The `details` list is sorted, and the `result` variable is assigned a new string value.
