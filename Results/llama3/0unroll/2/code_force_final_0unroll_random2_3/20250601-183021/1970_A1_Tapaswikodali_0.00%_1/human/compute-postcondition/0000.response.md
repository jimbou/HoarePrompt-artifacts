Output State: **stdin is empty, s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and its length does not exceed 500,000, balance is 0, details is an empty list**

The code snippet reads a string from stdin, assigns it to the variable `s`, and initializes two variables, `balance` and `details`, to 0 and an empty list, respectively. After executing the code, stdin is empty because the input operation has consumed the string. The string `s` now holds the balanced parentheses sequence that was initially in stdin. The variable `balance` remains 0, as no operations have modified it. The variable `details` is an empty list, as it was initialized as such and not modified by the code.
