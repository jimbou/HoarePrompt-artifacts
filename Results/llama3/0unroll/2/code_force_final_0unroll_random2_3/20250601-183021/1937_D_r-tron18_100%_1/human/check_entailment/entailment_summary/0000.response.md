Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element at a specific index, which is used to determine the position of the pinball after a certain number of moves. `func_2` uses `func_1` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball, inverting the character at each position after the pinball moves, and stopping the pinball when it leaves the grid. The program also correctly calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query, taking into account the positions of the '<' and '>' characters in the string.

The execution summaries provided for `func_1` and `func_2` match the expected behavior of the functions, and the program produces the correct output for the given example inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
