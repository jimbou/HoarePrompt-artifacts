This function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of a given list of integers and the element at a specific index. The index is determined by subtracting a given non-negative integer (times) from the end of the list, but not exceeding the start of the list. The function effectively compares the last element with an element a certain number of positions before it, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary.
