Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 plus 1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 plus 1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of zeros of length n.**

In this output state, the initial state of `s1` and `n` remains unchanged. The code introduces new variables: `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `ans`. The `pre` list contains the indices of '>' characters in `s1`, incremented by 1. The `totalOne` variable stores the count of '>' characters in `s1`. The `preOne` list contains the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' characters in `s1`, starting from 0. The `suffZero` list contains a single element, 0. The `ans` list is initialized with zeros, having the same length as `n`.
