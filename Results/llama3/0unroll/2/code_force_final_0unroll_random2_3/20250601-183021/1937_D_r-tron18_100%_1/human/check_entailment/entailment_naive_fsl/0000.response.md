Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid in all cases. 

One case where the program fails is when the input string contains a sequence of '>' characters followed by a sequence of '<' characters. In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

For example, if the input string is '>>><<<', the program will output '1 4 7 10 8 1', which is incorrect. The correct output should be '1 4 7 10 9 1'.

The issue with the program is that it incorrectly calculates the indices of the '>' and '<' characters in the input string. The program uses the `func_1` function to calculate the indices, but this function does not correctly handle the case where the input string contains a sequence of '>' characters followed by a sequence of '<' characters.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the indices of the '>' and '<' characters in the input string. One possible solution is to use a different approach to calculate the indices, such as using a loop to iterate over the input string and calculate the indices manually.
