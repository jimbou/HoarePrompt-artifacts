Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving a pinball moving on a one-dimensional grid based on certain rules. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the difference between the last element of a given list of integers and the element at a specific index. The index is determined by subtracting a given non-negative integer from the end of the list, but not exceeding the start of the list.

`func_2` calculates a list of integers representing the difference between the indices of '<' and '>' characters in a given string `s1`, based on certain conditions. The function performs calculations based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string and returns a list of integers representing the calculated values for each index in `s1`.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the input string `s1` and its length `n`, and calls `func_2` to calculate the list of integers representing the difference between the indices of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The calculated list is then printed.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program correctly implements the rules for the pinball movement and calculates the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
