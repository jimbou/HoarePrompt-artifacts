This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks if each string has all unique characters, and outputs 'NO' if all characters are the same. If all characters are different, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string sorted in ascending order. If the string is already sorted in ascending order, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string sorted in descending order. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string sorted in ascending order. The function processes a number of strings specified by the first input integer and leaves the input integer unchanged.
