Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program works correctly for all potential cases. It first checks if the length of the set of characters in the string is 1, which means all characters are the same. If so, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. If the length of the set is not 1, it prints 'YES' and then prints the rearranged string. The rearranged string is either the sorted string or the reverse sorted string, depending on whether the original string is already sorted or not. This approach ensures that the rearranged string is always different from the original string, as required by the problem description.
