Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine if a given string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. If it's possible, we need to output "YES" followed by the rearranged string. If it's not possible, we need to output "NO".

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads a string `s` and converts it into a set `a`. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. So, if the length of the set `a` is 1, it means that all characters in the string `s` are the same. In this case, it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string, so the program outputs "NO".

4. If the length of the set `a` is not 1, it means that the string `s` contains at least two different characters. In this case, the program outputs "YES" because it's possible to rearrange the string.

5. The program then sorts the string `s` in ascending and descending order using the `sorted()` function and joins the sorted characters back into strings `b` and `c` respectively.

6. If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it means that the original string is already sorted in ascending order. In this case, the program outputs the sorted string `c` in descending order.

7. If the sorted string `b` is not equal to the original string `s`, it means that the original string is not sorted in ascending order. In this case, the program outputs the sorted string `b` in ascending order.

8. The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
