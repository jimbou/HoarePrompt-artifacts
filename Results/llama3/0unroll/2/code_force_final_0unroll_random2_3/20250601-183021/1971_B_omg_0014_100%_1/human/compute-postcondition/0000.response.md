The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `n`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings. After the code is executed, the first integer is removed from the stdin, and the remaining inputs are still t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10.**
