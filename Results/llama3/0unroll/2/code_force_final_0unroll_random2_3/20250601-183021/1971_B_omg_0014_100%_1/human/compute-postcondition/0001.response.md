Output State: **The output state will be a series of strings, where each string is either 'NO', 'YES' followed by a string, or 'YES' followed by two strings. The number of strings will be equal to the value of `n`. For each string, if all characters are the same, the output will be 'NO'. If all characters are different, the output will be 'YES' followed by the string sorted in ascending order. If the string is already sorted in ascending order, the output will be 'YES' followed by the string sorted in descending order. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES' followed by the string sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` will be unchanged. The stdin will be empty.**
