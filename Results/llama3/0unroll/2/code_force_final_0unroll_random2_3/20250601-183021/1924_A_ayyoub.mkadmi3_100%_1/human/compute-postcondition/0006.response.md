Functionality: **This function takes a string s, an integer k, and an integer n as input, where s consists of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and 1 <= k <= 26 and 1 <= n <= 26. It processes the string s and returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean indicating whether the length of the processed string is greater than or equal to the product of n and k, a substring of the processed string starting from a calculated index, and an empty string. The function effectively filters the input string s, removing characters from a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, and returns a boolean value and a substring based on the length of the filtered string and the product of n and k.**
