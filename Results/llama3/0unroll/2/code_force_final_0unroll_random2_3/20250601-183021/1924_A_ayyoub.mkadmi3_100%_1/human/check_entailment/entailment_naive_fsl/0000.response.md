Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab

The program will output:

YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc

However, the correct output should be:

YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when the length of the string s is less than the length of the substring that needs to be found. In this case, the program will incorrectly output "YES" instead of "NO".

For example, if the input is:

1
3 3 5
abcab

The program will output:

YES

However, the correct output should be:

NO

Because the string "abcab" does not contain all possible substrings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
