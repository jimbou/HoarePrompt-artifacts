Output State: **s is a string consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, s1 is an empty string, s2 is an empty string, alphabet is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

The code initializes two empty strings, s1 and s2, and a set, alphabet, containing the first k lowercase English alphabets. The initial state of s, k, and n remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The set alphabet is created using a range of ASCII values from 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') to 97 + k, which corresponds to the first k lowercase English alphabets.
