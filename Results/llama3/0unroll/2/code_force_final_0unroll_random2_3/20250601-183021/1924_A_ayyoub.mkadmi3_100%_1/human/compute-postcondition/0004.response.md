Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean value indicating whether the length of string s1 is greater than or equal to the product of n and k, a substring of s1 starting from the index r*k, and an empty string s2. The boolean value is determined by the relationship between the length of s1 and the product of n and k. The substring of s1 starts from the index r*k, where r is 1 and k is an integer between 1 and 26. The empty string s2 is returned as is.**
