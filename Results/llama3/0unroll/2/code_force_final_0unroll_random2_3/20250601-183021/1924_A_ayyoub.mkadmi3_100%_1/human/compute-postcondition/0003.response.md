Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, s2 is an empty string, alphabet is a set of the first k lowercase English alphabets, r is an integer equal to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `r` is calculated as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`. Since `s1` consists of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, its length is equal to `k`. Therefore, `r` is equal to `k` divided by `k`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
