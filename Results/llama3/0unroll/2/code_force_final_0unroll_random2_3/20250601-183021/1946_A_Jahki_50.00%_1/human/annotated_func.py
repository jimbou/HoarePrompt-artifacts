#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the program will print the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the list greater than the original median for each test case, or it will print 1 and 16668 if the number of elements in the list is greater than 10000. The value of `num` remains unchanged, and the input from stdin is consumed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the list greater than the original median and prints this value. If the number of elements in the list exceeds 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 instead. The function consumes the input from stdin and does not modify the input value of `num`.
