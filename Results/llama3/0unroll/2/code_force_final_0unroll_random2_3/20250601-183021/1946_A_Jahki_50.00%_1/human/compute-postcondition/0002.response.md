Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the program will print the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the list greater than the original median for each test case, or it will print 1 and 16668 if the number of elements in the list is greater than 10000. The value of `num` remains unchanged, and the input from stdin is consumed.
