This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the list greater than the original median and prints this value. If the number of elements in the list exceeds 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 instead. The function consumes the input from stdin and does not modify the input value of `num`.
