Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

8
3
2 2 8
4
7 3 3 1
1
1000000000
5
5 5 5 4 5
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
2
1 2
2
1 1
4
5 5 5 5

The program prints:

1
2
1
3
2
1
2
3

However, the correct output should be:

1
2
1
3
2
1
2
3

The issue is that the program does not correctly handle the case when the median is already the maximum value in the array. In this case, the program should print 0, but instead, it prints 1.

For example, in the last test case, the input is:

4
5 5 5 5

The median is already 5, which is the maximum value in the array. Therefore, the correct output should be 0, but the program prints 3.

To fix this issue, the program should add a condition to check if the median is already the maximum value in the array, and if so, print 0 instead of 1.
