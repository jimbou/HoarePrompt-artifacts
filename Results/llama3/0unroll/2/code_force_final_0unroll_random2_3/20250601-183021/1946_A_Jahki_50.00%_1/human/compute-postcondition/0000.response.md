Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains a list of `num` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_num (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the variable `num` has been assigned the value of the first input integer, which is between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only contains a list of `num` integers, as the first input integer has been consumed. The values of the other variables are not affected.
