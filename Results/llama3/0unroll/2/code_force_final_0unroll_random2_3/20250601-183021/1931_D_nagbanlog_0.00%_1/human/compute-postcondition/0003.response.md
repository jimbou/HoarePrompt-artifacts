Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case. The test cases are represented by a list of lists, where each sublist contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The count of beautiful pairs is calculated based on these test cases.**
