Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers, `results` is an empty list**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The code only introduces a new variable `results`, which is initialized as an empty list.
