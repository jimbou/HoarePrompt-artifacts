    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers, `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case. The test cases are represented by a list of lists, where each sublist contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The count of beautiful pairs is calculated based on these test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the count of "beautiful pairs" for each test case in a given list of test cases. A beautiful pair is defined as two numbers in the test case array that satisfy certain modular arithmetic conditions. The function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case, calculates the count of beautiful pairs, and returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.
