Functionality: **This function calculates the count of "beautiful pairs" for each test case in a given list of test cases. A beautiful pair is defined as two numbers in the test case array that satisfy certain modular arithmetic conditions. The function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers. It processes each test case, calculates the count of beautiful pairs, and returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.**
