Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a frequency dictionary to store the count of numbers with specific remainders when divided by x and y. For each number, it calculates the required remainder when divided by x and y to form a beautiful pair, and checks if such a number exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, it increments the beautiful pairs count. The program handles all possible cases, including when x and y are equal, and when the array contains duplicate numbers.

The program also correctly handles the case when the required remainder is 0, which is a special case because (x - 0) % x is 0, not x. The program correctly calculates the required remainder as (x - mod_x) % x, which handles this special case.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the array, because it makes a single pass through the array. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case, the frequency dictionary can store n elements.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly solves the problem as described.
