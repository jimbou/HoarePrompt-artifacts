Output: **The loop will execute n // k iterations, and in each iteration, it will print a series of '?' queries with increasing values of l, until l reaches n + 1 or cnt becomes 0. If cnt becomes 0 and l reaches n + 1, it will print a '!' statement with the current value of i * v and then call func_2() before returning. The output state will be the final values of the variables after the loop has finished executing, which will be the last values printed by the '?' and '!' statements, and this is printed: '! -1'**
