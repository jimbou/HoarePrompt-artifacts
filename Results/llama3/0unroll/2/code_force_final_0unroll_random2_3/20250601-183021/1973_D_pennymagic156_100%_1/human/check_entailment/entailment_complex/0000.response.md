Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} such that 1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m. If no such m exists, it prints -1.

The program first reads the input values n and k, then initializes the variable v to 1. It then enters a loop that iterates from n to 1, printing a '?' query with the current value of i * n. If the response to the query is n, it sets v to the current value of i and breaks out of the loop.

After the loop, the program enters another loop that iterates from 1 to n // k. In each iteration, it prints a series of '?' queries with increasing values of l, until l reaches n + 1 or cnt becomes 0. If cnt becomes 0 and l reaches n + 1, it prints a '!' statement with the current value of i * v and then calls func_2() before returning.

If the loop completes without finding a match, the program prints '! -1' and calls func_2() before returning.

Correctness: **True**
