This function takes no parameters and returns nothing. It prints a series of '?' queries to the console, then either prints a '!' statement with a calculated value and calls another function, or prints '! -1' if the loop completes without finding a match. The function's purpose is to interact with an external system through the printed queries and statements, with the final state being the last values printed to the console.
