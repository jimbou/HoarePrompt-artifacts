Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not handle the case when the maximum value of the array is not at the beginning of the array. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct value of `v` and will not be able to split the array into `k` subarrays correctly.

For example, if the input is `n = 5, k = 2` and the hidden array is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program will not be able to find the correct value of `v` and will not be able to split the array into 2 subarrays correctly.

The program assumes that the maximum value of the array is at the beginning of the array, which is not always the case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
