Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is as follows: The loop has iterated from 1 to n // k (integer division of n by k) times. In each iteration, the loop has printed a series of '?' queries with increasing values of 'l' (starting from 1) and 'i' multiplied by 'v', until 'cnt' (initialized to k) becomes 0 or 'l' reaches n + 1. If 'cnt' becomes 0 and 'l' reaches n + 1, the loop prints a '!' statement with 'i' multiplied by 'v' and calls func_2() before returning. The values of 'n', 'k', and 'v' remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
