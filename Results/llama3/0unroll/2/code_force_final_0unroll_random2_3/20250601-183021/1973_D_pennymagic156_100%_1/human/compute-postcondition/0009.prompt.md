You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4.
    n, k = func_3()
    v = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
        
        v = func_2()
        
        if v == n:
            v = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, v is n.
    for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
        cnt, l = k, 1
        
        while cnt and l < n + 1:
            print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
            l = func_2() + 1
            cnt -= 1
        
        if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
            print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
            func_2()
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute n // k iterations, and in each iteration, it will print a series of '?' queries with increasing values of l, until l reaches n + 1 or cnt becomes 0. If cnt becomes 0 and l reaches n + 1, it will print a '!' statement with the current value of i * v and then call func_2() before returning. The output state will be the final values of the variables after the loop has finished executing, which will be the last values printed by the '?' and '!' statements.
    print('! -1', flush=True)
    #This is printed: ! -1
    func_2()
    return
    #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The function func_2() has been called and returned, but its return value is not used. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The function func_2() has been called and returned, but its return value is not used. The values of other variables remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
