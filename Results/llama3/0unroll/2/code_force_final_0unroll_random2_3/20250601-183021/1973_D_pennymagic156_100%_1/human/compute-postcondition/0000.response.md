Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, v is 1**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k` after this line. However, we can infer that `n` and `k` are still positive integers and that `k` is still less than or equal to `n`, which is less than or equal to 10^4.

The second line assigns the value 1 to `v`. This line does not affect the values of `n` and `k`.

Since we do not have the definition of `func_3()`, we cannot provide the exact values of `n` and `k` after the execution of the code. However, we can conclude that `n` and `k` are still positive integers within the specified range, and `v` is now 1.
