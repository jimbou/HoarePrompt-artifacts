Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final values of the variables are the last values printed by the '?' and '!' statements. The last value printed by the '!' statement is '-1', indicating that the function func_2() has been called and returned. The values of the other variables are not affected.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has completed its execution, and the final output is the last value printed by the '!' statement, which is '-1'. This indicates that the function func_2() has been called and has returned. The values of the other variables, such as n, k, l, cnt, i, and v, are not changed by the execution of func_2() and remain the same as they were before the function call.
