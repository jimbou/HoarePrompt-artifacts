Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned an integer between 1 and 1000, which is the first input from the stdin. The stdin now contains one less input, which is a binary string of size n. The size of the binary string n is still between 1 and 50.
