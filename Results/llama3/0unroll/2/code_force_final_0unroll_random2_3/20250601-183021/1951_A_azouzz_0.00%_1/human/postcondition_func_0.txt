This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then checks the binary string for specific patterns and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the string contains the pattern. The function does not modify the input values and only prints the results for each test case.
