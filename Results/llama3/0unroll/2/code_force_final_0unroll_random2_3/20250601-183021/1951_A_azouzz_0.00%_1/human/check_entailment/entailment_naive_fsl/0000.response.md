Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string `s` contains a single '1' and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, the program will print 'NO' because it checks if `cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1)`, but it should print 'YES' because it is possible to turn on a single lamp.

For example, if the input is `n = 3` and `s = '100'`, the program will print 'NO', but it should print 'YES' because it is possible to turn on the first lamp.
