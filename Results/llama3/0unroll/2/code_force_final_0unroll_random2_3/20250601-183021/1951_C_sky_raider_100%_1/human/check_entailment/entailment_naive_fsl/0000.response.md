Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the list of prices and then iterates over the sorted list, buying the minimum of m and k tickets at each price. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that the prices of the tickets increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices to get [2, 4, 6, 8] and then buy 2 tickets at price 2, 1 ticket at price 4, and 0 tickets at price 6 and 8. However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to buy 1 ticket on the third day at price 4, and 2 tickets on the fourth day at price 6, resulting in a total cost of 10.

The correct approach would be to use a priority queue to keep track of the prices of the tickets, and to update the prices after each purchase. This would ensure that the program always buys the tickets at the lowest possible price.
