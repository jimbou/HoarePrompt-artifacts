stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k, where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and k is the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line contains n space-separated integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
