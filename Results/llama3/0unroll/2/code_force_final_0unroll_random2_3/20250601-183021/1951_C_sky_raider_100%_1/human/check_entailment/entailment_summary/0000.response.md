Reasoning: 
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic of buying tickets over multiple days with a daily limit and increasing prices. The program sorts the prices in ascending order, which is correct, but then it calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets bought on each day by the price of the ticket on that day plus the total number of tickets bought so far. This is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the prices increase by the number of tickets bought on each day.

For example, in the first test case, the program will calculate the total cost as follows:

* Day 1: Buy 2 tickets at price 2, total cost = 2 * 2 = 4
* Day 2: Buy 1 ticket at price 4, total cost = 4 + 1 * 4 = 8
* Day 3: Buy 0 tickets at price 6, total cost = 8
* Day 4: Buy 0 tickets at price 8, total cost = 8

However, the correct total cost should be:

* Day 1: Buy 0 tickets at price 2, total cost = 0
* Day 2: Buy 0 tickets at price 4, total cost = 0
* Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at price 4, total cost = 4
* Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at price 6, total cost = 4 + 2 * 6 = 16

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
