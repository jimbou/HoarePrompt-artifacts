Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions and prints the modular inverse of the calculated value for each test case.

The program first calculates the sum of the initial friendship values (sum_f) and the total number of possible pairs (cn2). Then, it calculates the numerator (p) and denominator (q) of the expected value. The numerator is calculated as 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1), which represents the total sum of friendship values for all k excursions. The denominator is calculated as 2 * cn2 ** 2, which represents the total number of possible pairs squared.

The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of p and q using the math.gcd function and divides both p and q by the gcd to simplify the fraction. Finally, it calculates the modular inverse of q using the pow function with a modulus of 10^9 + 7 and prints the result multiplied by p.

The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior, and the program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
