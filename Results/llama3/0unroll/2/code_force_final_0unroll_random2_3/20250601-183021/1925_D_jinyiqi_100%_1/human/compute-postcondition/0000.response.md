Output State: **t is an integer, M is 1000000007, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains 3 integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to t. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line assigns the value of 10^9 + 7 to M. No other variables are affected.
