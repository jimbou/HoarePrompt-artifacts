The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates a value 'ans' based on the sum of the integers, the maximum sum of a subarray, and the value of k. It then prints the calculated value 'ans' for each test case, applying modular arithmetic with a modulus of 1000000007. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and the variable T equal to 0.
