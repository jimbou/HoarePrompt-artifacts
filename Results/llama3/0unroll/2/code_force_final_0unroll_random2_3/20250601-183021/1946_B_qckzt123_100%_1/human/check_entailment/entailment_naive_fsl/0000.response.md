Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when k is 0. In this case, the program should simply return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7, but instead, it tries to calculate the maximum sum of the array after k operations, which is not applicable when k is 0.

For example, if the input is:

1
5 0
4 -2 8 -12 9

The program should return 17, which is the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7. However, the program will try to calculate the maximum sum of the array after 0 operations, which is not a valid operation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
