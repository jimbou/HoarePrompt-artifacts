Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program first calculates the value of k, which is the minimum of n and b-a. If b is less than or equal to a, it means that selling all buns at the usual price a will result in the maximum profit, so it prints a*n. Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling the first k buns at the modified price and the remaining (n-k) buns at the usual price a, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
