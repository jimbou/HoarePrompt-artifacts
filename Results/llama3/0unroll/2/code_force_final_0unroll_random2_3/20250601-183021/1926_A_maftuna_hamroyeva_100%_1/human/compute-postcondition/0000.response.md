Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, stdin contains t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 32, which was previously unknown. The stdin still contains t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, but the first input (the integer t) has been consumed by the `input()` function.
