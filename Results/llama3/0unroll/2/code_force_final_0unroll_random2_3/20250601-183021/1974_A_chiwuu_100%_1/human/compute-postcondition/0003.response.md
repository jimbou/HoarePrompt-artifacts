Functionality: **This function reads a series of inputs from the standard input, where the first input is an integer t representing the number of subsequent inputs, and each subsequent input is a pair of space-separated integers x and y. For each pair of integers, the function calculates a value t based on the given formula and prints it. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output values based on the calculations. The final state of the program is the output of the calculated values, which are printed to the standard output.**
