Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, and in each iteration, it will read two space-separated integers `x` and `y` from the standard input. The loop will calculate a value `t` based on `x` and `y` and print it. The output state will be the values of `t` printed in each iteration, which will be `n` values in total. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged.
