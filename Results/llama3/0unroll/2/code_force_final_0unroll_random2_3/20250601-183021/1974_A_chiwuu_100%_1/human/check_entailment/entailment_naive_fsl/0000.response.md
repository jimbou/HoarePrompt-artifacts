Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The logic is sound, and the program handles all possible cases.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. For each test case, the program reads the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b).
2. It calculates the number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons (t). If the number of 2x2 icons is even, it can be divided evenly among the screens. If it's odd, one screen will have an empty space.
3. It calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons (t1). This is done by subtracting the space occupied by the 2x2 icons (4 cells each) from the total space available on the screens (15 cells each).
4. If the remaining space (t1) is sufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons (a), the program uses the same number of screens (t).
5. If the remaining space is not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens needed to accommodate the 1x1 icons (t2). It does this by subtracting the remaining space (t1) from the total number of 1x1 icons (a).
6. If the additional screens needed (t2) are a multiple of 15, the program adds the corresponding number of screens to the total. Otherwise, it adds one more screen to account for the remaining icons.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the number of 2x2 icons is even or odd.
* When the number of 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons.
* When the number of 1x1 icons exceeds the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons.

Overall, the program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
