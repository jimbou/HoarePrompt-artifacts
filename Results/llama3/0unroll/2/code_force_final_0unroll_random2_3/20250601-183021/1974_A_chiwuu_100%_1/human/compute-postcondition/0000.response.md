The code `n = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `n`. The stdin contains t+1 inputs, and the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). This integer is assigned to `n`. The rest t inputs are two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99), which are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t inputs: two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**
