Output State: **left is the index of the last '1' in s, right is the index of the last '0' in s, cost is the total number of swaps made, and s is sorted such that all '0's are on the right and all '1's are on the left.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the list `s` will be sorted such that all '0's are on the right side and all '1's are on the left side. The variable `left` will point to the last '1' in the sorted list, and the variable `right` will point to the last '0' in the sorted list. The variable `cost` will hold the total number of swaps made to achieve this sorted state.
