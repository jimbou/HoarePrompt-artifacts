Functionality: This function takes a string of binary digits (0s and 1s) as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to sort the string such that all 0s are on the right and all 1s are on the left. The function does not modify the original input string. It creates a copy of the input string, sorts it in-place, and counts the number of swaps performed during the sorting process. The function returns the total number of swaps made to achieve the sorted state.
