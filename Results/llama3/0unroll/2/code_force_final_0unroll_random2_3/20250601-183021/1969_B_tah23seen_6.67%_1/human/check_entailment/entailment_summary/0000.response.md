Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. The program iterates through the string, swapping '0's and '1's when necessary, and increments the cost by the length of the substring being shifted. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the string is already sorted or has only one type of digit.

Correctness: **True**
