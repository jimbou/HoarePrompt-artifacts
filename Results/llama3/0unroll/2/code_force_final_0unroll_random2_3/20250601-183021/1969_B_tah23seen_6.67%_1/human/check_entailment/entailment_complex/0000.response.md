Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to sort the string.

The program first converts the input string `sChar` into a list of characters `s`. Then, it initializes two pointers `left` and `right` to the first and second characters of the string, respectively. The `cost` variable is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total number of swaps.

The program then enters a while loop that continues until `left` is greater than `right` or `right` reaches the end of the string. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at the `right` index is '0' and the character at the `left` index is '1'. If this condition is true, it swaps the characters at the `right` and `left` indices and increments the `cost` by the difference between `right` and `left` plus 1.

After the swap, the program increments `right` until it finds a '0' and increments `left` until it finds a '1'. This process continues until the end of the string is reached.

Finally, the program returns the total `cost`, which represents the minimum number of swaps required to sort the string.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the binary string. The use of two pointers `left` and `right` to track the positions of '1's and '0's, respectively, is efficient and effective. The program also correctly increments the `cost` variable to account for the swaps performed.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it only needs to traverse the string once to find the minimum number of swaps. The space complexity is also O(n) because it creates a copy of the input string.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient in solving the problem.
