Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program uses a two-pointer approach, where the left pointer starts at the beginning of the string and the right pointer starts at the second character.

The program iterates through the string, swapping characters when it encounters a '1' on the left and a '0' on the right. The cost of the swap is calculated as the difference between the right and left pointers plus one. The right pointer is then moved to the next '0' in the string, and the left pointer is moved to the next '1' in the string.

The program continues this process until the right pointer reaches the end of the string or the left pointer reaches the end of the string.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1` is not correctly defined. It should take a string as input, but it is defined to take a character as input.
2. The program does not handle the case where the input string is already sorted. In this case, the program should return 0, but it will return a non-zero value because of the way the cost is calculated.
3. The program does not handle the case where the input string contains only '0's or only '1's. In this case, the program should return 0, but it will return a non-zero value because of the way the cost is calculated.

Correctness: **False**
