Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.

The provided program uses a simple approach based on the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the absolute difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

This approach is correct because the game can be analyzed as follows:

* If the difference between the number of coins is even, Alice and Bob can alternate exchanging wallets and removing coins, ensuring that the difference remains even. In this case, Bob will always have a valid move, and Alice will eventually run out of coins, losing the game.
* If the difference between the number of coins is odd, Alice can exchange wallets with Bob on her first move, making the difference even. Then, Bob can exchange wallets with Alice on his turn, making the difference odd again. This process can continue, with the difference alternating between even and odd. In this case, Alice will always have a valid move, and Bob will eventually run out of coins, losing the game.

The program correctly implements this logic, printing "Bob" when the difference is even and "Alice" when the difference is odd.

Correctness: **True**
