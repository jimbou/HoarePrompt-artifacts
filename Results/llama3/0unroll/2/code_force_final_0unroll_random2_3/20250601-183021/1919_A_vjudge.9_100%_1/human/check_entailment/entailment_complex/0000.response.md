Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by analyzing the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the absolute difference is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win.

The program correctly implements this logic by calculating the absolute difference between `a` and `b` using the `abs` function and then checking if it's even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If the remainder is 0, the difference is even, and Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

The program also correctly handles the input and output for each test case, reading the input values `a` and `b` and printing the corresponding winner.

Correctness: **True**
