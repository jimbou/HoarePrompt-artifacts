Output State: The output state will be a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed to the console, with each output corresponding to the result of the comparison between the absolute difference of `a` and `b` and 2 for each test case. The number of outputs will be equal to the number of test cases `t`. The value of `t` will remain unchanged.
