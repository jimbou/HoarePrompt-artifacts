Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

When the absolute difference is even, Bob wins, and when it's odd, Alice wins. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their current wallet, and the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. By analyzing the possible moves and their consequences, it can be shown that the parity of the absolute difference determines the winner.

The program correctly calculates the absolute difference between the input integers `a` and `b` using the `abs` function and checks its parity using the modulo operator (`%`). Based on the result, it prints the winner's name, either "Alice" or "Bob".

Correctness: **True**
