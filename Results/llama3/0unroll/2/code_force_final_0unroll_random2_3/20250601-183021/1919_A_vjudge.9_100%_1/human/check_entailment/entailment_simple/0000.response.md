Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem can be solved by observing the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the difference is even, Bob will win, and if the difference is odd, Alice will win.

The program correctly implements this logic by calculating the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and checking if it is even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If the result is 0, it means the difference is even, and the program prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` and printing the corresponding result.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
