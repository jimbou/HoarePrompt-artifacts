The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b`, the first integer is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers `a` and `b` (1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9), with the first integer of the first test case removed**.

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, and the standard input still contains the remaining test cases, but with the first integer of the first test case removed.
