Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine who will win the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets.

The program uses the fact that if the absolute difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even, then Bob will win, and if it is odd, then Alice will win. This is because if the difference is even, then Alice and Bob will alternate making moves, and Bob will make the last move. If the difference is odd, then Alice will make the last move.

The program correctly implements this logic using the expression `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` to determine whether the difference is even or odd, and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
