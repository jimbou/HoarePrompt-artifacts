Output State: **bigList and smallList are truncated from the end until they are no longer equal at the end or until smallList is empty.**

In this output state, the loop has iterated until either the last elements of bigList and smallList were no longer equal or until smallList was completely emptied. As a result, both lists have been truncated from the end, with the last elements being removed in each iteration. The remaining elements in bigList and smallList are unchanged, and any other variables in the initial state remain unaffected.
