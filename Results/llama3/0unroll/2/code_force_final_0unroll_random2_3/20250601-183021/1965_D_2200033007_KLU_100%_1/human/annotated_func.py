    #
    #In this output state, `cts` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` starting from each index to the end of the list. For example, if `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `cts` will be `[1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 2, 5, 9, 14, 3, 7, 12, 4, 9, 5]`. The list `a` remains unchanged.

    #The program returns a sorted list of cumulative sums of `a` from each index to the end.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a list of cumulative sums of the input list `a` from each index to the end, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns it. The input list `a` remains unchanged. The function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a sorted list of cumulative sums.

    return odds
    #The program returns a list of integers containing the first and last elements of `cts` that do not have a pair in the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers containing the first and last elements of the input list that do not have a pair in the list. It effectively removes all pairs of identical integers from the input list, leaving only the unpaired elements at the beginning and end of the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer such that n is odd and the length of odds is equal to (n+1)/2.

        prev = x

    #State: Output State: odds is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer such that n is odd and the length of odds is equal to (n+1)/2, a is a list of integers of length n, prev is the last element of odds, idx is -1.
    return a
    #The program returns a list of integers of length n, where n is a positive odd integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of positive integers (odds) and a positive odd integer (n) as input, where the length of odds is equal to (n+1)/2. It returns a list of integers (a) of length n, where the elements of a are calculated based on the elements of odds. The function performs a series of calculations to populate the list a, using the elements of odds and their differences. The final state of the program is a list of integers a, where the length of a is equal to the input integer n.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of elements of any type and value, and bigList is longer than smallList.
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: bigList and smallList are truncated from the end until they are no longer equal at the end or until smallList is empty.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the truncated bigList.

#Overall this is what the function does:Truncates two lists from the end until they are no longer equal or until the smaller list is empty, and returns the last element of the truncated longer list. If the smaller list is empty after truncation, the function returns the last element of the remaining longer list.
