Output State: **The program returns the last element of the truncated bigList.**

Since bigList and smallList were truncated from the end until they are no longer equal at the end or until smallList is empty, the last element of bigList is the one that is different from the last element of smallList, or it is the last element of bigList when smallList is empty.
