Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a solution to the problem of recovering a palindrome array from the sums of its distinct subarrays. The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`.

`func_1` generates all possible subarray sums of a given array `a` and returns them in sorted order.

`func_2` takes the sorted list of subarray sums and removes any duplicates, returning a list of unique sums.

`func_3` takes the list of unique sums and the length of the original array `n` as input. It then constructs a palindrome array `a` by iterating through the unique sums and assigning values to the array such that the sums of the subarrays match the given sums.

`func_4` is not used in the provided code, but it appears to be a helper function to remove common elements from the end of two lists.

The program seems to correctly implement the logic to recover a palindrome array from the sums of its distinct subarrays. The use of `func_1` and `func_2` to generate and process the subarray sums is correct, and `func_3` correctly constructs the palindrome array.

The program handles the case where the missing subarray sum is not present in the input list, as it only uses the unique sums to construct the palindrome array. It also handles the case where the input list contains duplicate sums, as `func_2` removes any duplicates.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work for all possible inputs.
