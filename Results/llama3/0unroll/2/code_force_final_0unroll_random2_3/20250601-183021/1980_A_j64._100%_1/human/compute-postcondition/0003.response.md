Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where each integer at index `i` represents the frequency of the character with ASCII value `ord('A') + i` in string `a`, `needed_problems` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `count` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `needed_problems` which is initialized to 0.
