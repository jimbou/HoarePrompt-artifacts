Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings and output 2, but the correct output should be 1 because only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The issue is that the program uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately, and then adds them together. However, this approach does not account for overlapping substrings. To fix this, the program should use a more sophisticated approach, such as using a regular expression or a loop that checks for overlapping substrings.

For example, a correct implementation could use the following approach:
```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        count = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i:i+3] == 'map':
                count += 1
                i += 3
            elif s[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                count += 1
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        print(count)
```
This implementation uses a loop that checks for overlapping substrings "map" and "pie" and increments the count only when a non-overlapping occurrence is found.
