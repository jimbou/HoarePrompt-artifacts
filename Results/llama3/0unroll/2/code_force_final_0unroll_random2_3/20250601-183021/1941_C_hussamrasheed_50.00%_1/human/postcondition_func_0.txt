This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string s of length n. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string s, prints their sum, and repeats this process for all test cases. The function does not modify the input variables or have any side effects beyond printing the results.
