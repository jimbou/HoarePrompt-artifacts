Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then a string s of length n. 1 <= n <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the first input from the stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with two inputs: an integer n and a string s of length n. The constraints on n and the sum of n over all test cases remain the same as in the initial state.
