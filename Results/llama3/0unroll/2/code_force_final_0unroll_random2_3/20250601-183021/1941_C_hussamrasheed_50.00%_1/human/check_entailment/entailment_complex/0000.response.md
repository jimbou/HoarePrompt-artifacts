Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string s and prints their sum, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

The program first reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads the length of the string n and the string s itself. It then counts the occurrences of 'map' in the string s and replaces all occurrences of 'map' with an empty string. After that, it counts the occurrences of 'pie' in the modified string s. The sum of these two counts is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

The program correctly handles the case where the string s is already beautiful, in which case it prints 0.

Correctness: **True**
