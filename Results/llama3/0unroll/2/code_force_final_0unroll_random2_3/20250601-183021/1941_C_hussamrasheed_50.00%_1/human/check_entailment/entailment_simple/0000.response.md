Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. The program works by counting the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string, and then printing the sum of these counts.

The program correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases, the length of the string, and the string itself. It also correctly counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where 'map' and 'pie' overlap in the string. For example, if the string contains the substring 'mapie', the program will count this as two separate occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', when in fact it should only count as one occurrence.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
