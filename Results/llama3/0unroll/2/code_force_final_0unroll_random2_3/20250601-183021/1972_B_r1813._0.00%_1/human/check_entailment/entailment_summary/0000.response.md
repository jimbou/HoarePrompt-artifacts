Reasoning: 

The given program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the number of 'U' characters in the input string. The program reads the input data, counts the number of 'U' characters, and prints 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even. This logic is consistent with the problem description, which states that Alice will win the game if the number of 'U' characters is odd, and Bob will win if the number of 'U' characters is even.

Correctness: **True**
