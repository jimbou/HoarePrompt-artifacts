Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results. The logic for determining who will win the game is also correct. The program counts the number of 'U' coins in the string and checks if it's odd or even. If it's odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because if there are an odd number of 'U' coins, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of 'U' coins, and vice versa. This will continue until there are no 'U' coins left, at which point the player who made the last move will win.

Correctness: **True**
