This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string containing only 'U' and 'D' characters. It then determines whether the number of 'U' characters in each string is odd or even and prints 'YES' if odd and 'NO' if even, for each test case. The function consumes all input from standard input and produces a corresponding number of output lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'.
