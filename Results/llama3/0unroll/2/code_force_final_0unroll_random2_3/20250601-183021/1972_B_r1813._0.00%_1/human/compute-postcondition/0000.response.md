Output State: **stdin is empty, t is an integer between 1 and 100, index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings containing a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D"**

The code reads all input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, storing it in the `data` variable. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and stored in `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The `index` variable is incremented to 1, pointing to the next element in `data`, which is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". The `results` list is initialized as an empty list.
