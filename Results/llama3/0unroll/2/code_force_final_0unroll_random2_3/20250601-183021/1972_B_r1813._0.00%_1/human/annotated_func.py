#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and then a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) containing only "U" and "D".
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of t is 0, index is t * 2 + 1, results is a list of strings of length t containing either 'YES' or 'NO', stdin is empty, and data remains unchanged.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of t is 0, index is t * 2 + 1, results is a list of strings of length t containing either 'YES' or 'NO', stdin is empty, and data remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string containing only 'U' and 'D' characters. It then determines whether the number of 'U' characters in each string is odd or even and prints 'YES' if odd and 'NO' if even, for each test case. The function consumes all input from standard input and produces a corresponding number of output lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'.
