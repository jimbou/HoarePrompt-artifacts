Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_5()` correctly calculates the maximum number of pairs of numbers that can be selected from the array `a` such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in each pair is less than or equal to `x`.

The function first reads the input values `n` and `x` using `func_3()`, and then reads the array `a` using `func_1()`. It then iterates over the bits of `x` from most significant to least significant, and for each bit, it checks if the corresponding bit in the elements of `a` is set.

If the bit is set in `x` but not in any element of `a`, the function returns -1, indicating that no pairs can be formed. If the bit is set in `x` and in an even number of elements of `a`, the function calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be formed by dividing the elements of `a` into pairs based on the value of the current bit.

If the bit is not set in `x` but is set in an odd number of elements of `a`, the function returns -1, indicating that no pairs can be formed. If the bit is not set in `x` and is not set in any element of `a`, the function continues to the next bit.

Finally, the function returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed, or -1 if no pairs can be formed.

The other functions, `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, and `func_4()`, are helper functions that read input values from standard input and return them in the required format. They do not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the given program is correct and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.
