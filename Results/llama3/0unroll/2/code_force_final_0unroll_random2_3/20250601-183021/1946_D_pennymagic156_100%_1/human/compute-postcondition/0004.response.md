Functionality: **This function determines the maximum number of pairs of elements in a list that have the same bit set to 1 at a specific position, or returns -1 if no such pairs exist. It takes no direct parameters but uses the values of n, x, and list a, which are assumed to be set before the function call. The function returns the maximum number of pairs or -1, while leaving the value of x unchanged and the value of n unchanged. The list a is either left unchanged or modified to contain only the elements that had the i-th bit set to 1 for some i, and the list t is always left empty.**
