Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of pairs of elements in the array `a` that have the same `i-th` bit set to 1 for some `i`, while ensuring that the bitwise OR of the XOR of these pairs does not exceed `x`. The program iterates over the bits of `x` from most significant to least significant, and for each bit, it checks if the number of elements in `a` with that bit set is even. If it is, the program updates the maximum number of pairs found so far. If the number of elements with the bit set is odd, the program returns -1, as it is not possible to form pairs with an odd number of elements. The program also handles the case where `x` is 0 correctly, returning -1 if `a` contains any non-zero elements.

Correctness: **True**
