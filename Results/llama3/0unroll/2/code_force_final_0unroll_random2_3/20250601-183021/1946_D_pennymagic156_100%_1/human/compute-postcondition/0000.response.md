Output State: **n is a positive integer, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^30, t is an empty list, ans is -1**

The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `x`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the given code, we assume it returns a positive integer for `n` and a non-negative integer less than 2^30 for `x`. The second line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns its return value to `a`. Again, since `func_1()` is not defined, we assume it returns a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^30. The third line initializes an empty list `t` and assigns -1 to `ans`. 

After executing the entire code block, the values of `n`, `x`, and `a` are updated based on the return values of `func_3()` and `func_1()`. The list `t` is initialized as an empty list, and `ans` is set to -1. The initial state's information about `n`, `x`, and `a` is still valid, but their values are updated according to the function calls.
