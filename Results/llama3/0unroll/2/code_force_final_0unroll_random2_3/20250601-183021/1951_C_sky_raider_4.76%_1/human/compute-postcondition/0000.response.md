Output State: **The output state will contain multiple lines of output, each representing the result of a test case. Each result is the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal, considering the constraints of the problem. The cost is calculated by summing the product of each element and the minimum of m and k, and subtracting the sum of squares of the minimum of m and k divided by 2. The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the minimum cost for a test case.**
