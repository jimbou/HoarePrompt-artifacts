Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The issue lies in the way it calculates the cost of purchasing tickets on each day. The program sorts the list of prices and then iterates over it, purchasing the maximum possible tickets on each day. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that the prices of the tickets increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices and get [2, 4, 6, 8]. Then it will purchase 2 tickets on the first day (price 2), 1 ticket on the second day (price 4), and 0 tickets on the third and fourth days. The total cost will be 2*2 + 1*4 = 8. However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to purchase 1 ticket on the third day (price 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (price 2 + 2 = 4), resulting in a total cost of 4 + 2*4 = 12.

The program does not consider this scenario and therefore does not produce the correct result.
