Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers (n, m, k) and a list of n integers. It calculates the minimum cost to make all elements in the list equal, considering the constraints of the problem, and prints the result for each test case. The cost is calculated by summing the product of each element and the minimum of m and k, and subtracting the sum of squares of the minimum of m and k divided by 2. The function outputs a series of integers, each representing the minimum cost for a test case.**
