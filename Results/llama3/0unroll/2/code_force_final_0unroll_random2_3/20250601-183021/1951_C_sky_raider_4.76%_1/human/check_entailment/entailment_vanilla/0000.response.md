Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the prices of the tickets and then purchasing the tickets in the order of the lowest price. However, the program is not correctly implementing the dynamic programming approach required to solve this problem.

The program is sorting the prices of the tickets, but it is not considering the effect of purchasing tickets on the prices of the subsequent days. The program is also not correctly calculating the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum spending to purchase k tickets for each day. The program should also consider the effect of purchasing tickets on the prices of the subsequent days.

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
