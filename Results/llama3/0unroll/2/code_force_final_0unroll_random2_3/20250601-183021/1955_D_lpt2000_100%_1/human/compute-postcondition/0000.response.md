Output State: **`nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The second line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m, where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.**

In this output state, the value of `nabors` is an integer that was read from the input, which was the first line of a test case containing three integers: n, m, and k. The remaining two lines of the test case, containing n integers and m integers respectively, are still in the stdin.
