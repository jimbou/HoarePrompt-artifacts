Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second and third lines contain lists of integers aa and bb, respectively. The function calculates the number of times the number of pairs of common elements between aa and bb is greater than or equal to k, and prints this count for each test case.**
