Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Bob to set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program uses a greedy approach, where it first checks if n is equal to k, in which case it prints 'YES' and the unit sizes 1 and 1. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO'. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the number of units of each size needed to make k items and prints 'YES' along with the unit sizes if the total number of units is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the cases where n is equal to k, n is less than k, and n is greater than or equal to k. It also correctly calculates the number of units of each size needed to make k items and prints the correct results.

However, the program does not handle the case where k is 1 and n is greater than 1. In this case, the program will print 'YES' and the unit sizes n and 1, but it should print 'YES' and the unit size n only.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
