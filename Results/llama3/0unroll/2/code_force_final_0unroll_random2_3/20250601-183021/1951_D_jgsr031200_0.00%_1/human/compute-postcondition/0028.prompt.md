You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers.
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n and k remain unchanged, still being equal to each other. The previously printed values 'YES', 1, and 1 remain printed.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being less than k. The program also does not print anything, as the 'NO' print statement is not executed due to the return statement.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is smaller than k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is a positive integer.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: [n - k + 1] (where n - k + 1 is a negative integer), 1
    #State: n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is smaller than k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is a positive integer. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is larger than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed along with n - k + 1 and 1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n and k remain unchanged, still being equal to each other. The previously printed values 'YES', 1, and 1 remain printed.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being less than k. The program also does not print anything, as the 'NO' print statement is not executed due to the return statement.

Case_3: n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is smaller than k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is a positive integer and the current value of h is less than k, and 'NO' is being printed

Case_4: n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, n is smaller than k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is a positive integer, h is larger than or equal to k, and 'YES' is being printed, and this is printed: n - k + 1 and 1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
