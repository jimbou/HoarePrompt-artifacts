Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If so, it prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, which allows Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

If n is less than k, the program prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

If n is greater than k, the program calculates the cost of the first stall as n - k + 1 and the cost of the second stall as 1. It then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls.

If the total number of jewels Alice can buy is less than k, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls with the calculated costs.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. However, there is a small mistake in the program. In the last print statement, it should print the costs of the stalls, not 'YES'. The correct print statement should be `print(*costs)`.

Correctness: **False**
