Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where n is equal to k, n is less than k, and n is greater than or equal to k. 

In the case where n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' and the price for one stall as 1, which is correct because Alice can buy k jewels at a price of 1 coin per jewel.

In the case where n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy k jewels with less than k coins.

In the case where n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the cost of the first stall as n - k + 1 and the cost of the second stall as 1. It then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy at these prices. If the total number of jewels is less than k, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the costs of the two stalls. 

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
