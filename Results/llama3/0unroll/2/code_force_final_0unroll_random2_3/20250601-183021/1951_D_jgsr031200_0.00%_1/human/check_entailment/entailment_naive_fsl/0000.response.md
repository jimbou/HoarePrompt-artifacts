Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 10 and k = 5, the program prints 'YES' and the costs [6, 1], but this is incorrect because Alice will buy 1 jewel at the first stall and be left with 4 coins, which is not enough to buy any jewels at the second stall, so she will only buy 1 jewel in total, not 5.

The problem with the program is that it only checks if the total number of jewels that can be bought is greater than or equal to k, but it does not check if the jewels can be bought in the correct order. The program assumes that the jewels can be bought in the order of the costs, but this is not always the case.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check if the jewels can be bought in the correct order, not just if the total number of jewels is greater than or equal to k.
