Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to make a certain number of items (k) using a given number of units (n), with the option to use two different unit sizes (n - k + 1 and 1). If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' and the unit sizes 1 and 1. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO'. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the number of units of each size needed to make k items and prints 'YES' along with the unit sizes if the total number of units is greater than or equal to k, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, but instead prints the results directly.**
