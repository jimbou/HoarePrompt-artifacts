The code prints the elements of the `costs` list. The `costs` list contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Since `n` is `0` and `k` is a positive integer, `n - k + 1` will be a negative integer. Therefore, the `print` statement will output the two elements of the `costs` list, which are a negative integer (`n - k + 1`) and `1`.

Output: **[n - k + 1] (where n - k + 1 is a negative integer), 1**
