Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and the value of `n_i`, but it does not take into account the rest of the sequence `a` and the iterative process of removing players from the game.

For example, consider the input `k=3`, `q=1`, `a=[2, 3, 5]`, and `n_1=5`. The correct output should be `2`, because in the first round, players 2 and 3 are removed, and in the second round, player 5 is removed, leaving players 1 and 4 as winners. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect.

The program needs to be modified to correctly implement the game logic, taking into account the entire sequence `a` and the iterative process of removing players from the game.
