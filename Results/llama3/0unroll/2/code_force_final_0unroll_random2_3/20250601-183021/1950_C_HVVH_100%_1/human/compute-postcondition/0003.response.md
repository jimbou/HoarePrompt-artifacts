Functionality: **This function reads a series of time inputs in 24-hour format from standard input, converts each time to 12-hour format, and prints the converted time along with the corresponding day period (AM/PM). The function processes a variable number of time inputs, as specified by an initial integer input, and continues until all inputs have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.**
