Output State: **day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 strings, each of length 5 with format hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.**

The first line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable day. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to n. Since stdin contains a single integer t followed by t strings, after reading the first integer, stdin will be left with t-1 strings. The value of n will be an integer between 1 and 1440 inclusive, as specified in the initial state.
