Reasoning:

The given program is designed to convert 24-hour format time to 12-hour format time. It correctly handles the conversion of hours and minutes, and also determines whether the time is in the morning (AM) or afternoon/evening (PM).

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads the time in 24-hour format (`hh:mm`) and splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
3. If the hour is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
4. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to 'PM'.
5. If the hour is between 1 and 11, it sets the day to 'AM'. However, if the hour is exactly 12, it sets the day to 'PM'.
6. Finally, it prints the time in 12-hour format with the correct day ('AM' or 'PM').

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases for converting 24-hour format time to 12-hour format time.

Correctness: **True**
