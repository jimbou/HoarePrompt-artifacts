Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to generate a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes two space-separated integers n and k as input from stdin, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It generates a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where the first k numbers are arranged in a cyclic manner. The function prints the resulting permutation as a space-separated string.

func_2 repeats the function call of func_1 a specified number of times based on user input, until no more input is available.

The problem statement requires generating a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. The given program meets this requirement by generating a permutation that satisfies the condition of being k-level.

The execution summaries of the functions provide evidence that the program behaves as expected. func_1 generates the desired permutation, and func_2 repeats this process for multiple test cases.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.
