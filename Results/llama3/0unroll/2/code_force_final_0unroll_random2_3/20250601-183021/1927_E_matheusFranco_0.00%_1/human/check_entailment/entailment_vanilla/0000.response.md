Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a k-level permutation of length n. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes the input of two integers n and k, and constructs a k-level permutation of length n. It initializes an array `permutation` of size n with all elements as 0. It then iterates over the range of k, and for each iteration, it assigns values to the elements of the `permutation` array in a specific pattern. The pattern is such that the difference between the maximum and minimum sum of any k continuous elements in the permutation is at most 1.

`func_2` takes the input of the number of test cases t, and calls `func_1` t times.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program.

The program correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n. The pattern used to assign values to the `permutation` array ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sum of any k continuous elements in the permutation is at most 1. This is because the values are assigned in a way that the sum of any k continuous elements is either equal to the average of the first and last elements of the permutation, or differs from it by at most 1.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not handle the case when n is not a multiple of k. In such cases, the program will not be able to construct a k-level permutation of length n.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
