Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program is designed to construct a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. The program uses a clever approach to construct the permutation by iterating over the multiples of k and assigning values to the permutation array.

The key insight here is that the program constructs the permutation in such a way that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. This is achieved by assigning values to the permutation array in a way that the sums of the segments are distributed evenly.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the input values n and k, constructs the permutation, and prints the result. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

After analyzing the program, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the fact that k is even and that the permutation should be of length n.

The program also passes the example test cases provided, which further confirms its correctness.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
