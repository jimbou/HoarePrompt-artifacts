The code prints the elements of the permutation array, which is filled with values from 1 to k in a cyclic manner, starting from index 0 and incrementing by k each time. The elements are separated by spaces and stored in the result string.
Output: **1 2 3 ... k (where k is the value of k and the elements are separated by spaces)**
