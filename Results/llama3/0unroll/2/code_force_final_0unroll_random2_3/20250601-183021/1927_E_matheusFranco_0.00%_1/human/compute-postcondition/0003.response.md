Output State: **The permutation array is filled with values from 1 to k in a cyclic manner, starting from index 0 and incrementing by k each time. The value of curr_v is k + 1. result is a string containing the elements of the permutation array separated by spaces.**

In this output state, the permutation array remains unchanged, still filled with values from 1 to k in a cyclic manner. The value of curr_v also remains unchanged, still equal to k + 1. The only change is the introduction of the result variable, which is a string containing the elements of the permutation array separated by spaces.
