Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the input array into two subsequences. The program iterates through the array, maintaining two variables `a` and `b` to store the maximum values of the two subsequences. It also keeps track of the count of elements that are greater than both `a` and `b` and updates `a` and `b` accordingly.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array is already sorted in ascending or descending order.
* When the array has duplicate elements.
* When the array has elements that are equal to `a` or `b`.
* When the array has elements that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of elements that are greater than both `a` and `b` and adding 1 to the count for each such element.

The program also handles edge cases, such as when the input array has only one element or when the input array is empty.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty and handles all possible cases, making it correct.
