You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the size of the array) and then a list of integers (the elements of the array). The size of the array is a positive integer and the elements of the array are positive integers less than or equal to the size of the array.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = l[0]
        
        b = 0
        
        c = 0
        
        y = 0
        
        for y in range(1, n):
            if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
                b = l[y]
                break
        
        for x in range(y + 1, n):
            if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
                if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                    a = l[x]
                else:
                    b = l[x]
                c += 1
            elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
                if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                    a = l[x]
                else:
                    b = l[x]
            elif a >= l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        
        print(c)
        
    #State: The output state will be the number of times the elements in the array are updated to maintain the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, it will be the number of times the variables 'a' and 'b' are updated to ensure that 'a' is the maximum element in the array and 'b' is the second maximum element in the array, or vice versa, while iterating through the array from the second element to the end.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
