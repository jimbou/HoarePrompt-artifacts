Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. The current implementation only checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which is not sufficient. It does not check if there are any digits after letters in the password.

For example, the password "a1b2" would be incorrectly classified as a strong password by the program, because it only checks if the last digit '2' is greater than any of the letters, which is not the case. However, the password "a1b2" does not meet the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter, because the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a' and the digit '2' comes after the letter 'b'. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
