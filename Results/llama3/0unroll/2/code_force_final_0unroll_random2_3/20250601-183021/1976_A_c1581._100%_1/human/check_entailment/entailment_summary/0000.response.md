Reasoning:

The given program is designed to check if a password meets certain conditions: it should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, there should be no digit that comes after a letter, all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program defines a function `func_1(password)` that separates the password into digits and letters, sorts them, and checks if the sorted digits and letters are in the correct order. It also checks if the last digit is not greater than any letter.

However, the program has a logical error. The condition `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` is unnecessary because the digits are already sorted in ascending order. This condition will always be false.

Moreover, the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is incorrect. It checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, but it should check if any digit is greater than any letter that comes after it.

The correct condition should be to check if any digit comes after a letter. This can be done by checking if the index of the last digit is less than the index of the first letter.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
