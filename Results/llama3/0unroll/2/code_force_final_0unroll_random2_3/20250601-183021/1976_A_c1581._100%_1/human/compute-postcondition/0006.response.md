Postcondition: **The loop will return False if the digits list is not sorted in ascending order or if the last digit is greater than any letter in the letters list. Otherwise, the loop will finish all iterations without returning False, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged. `sortedPassword` is assigned the concatenation of `digits` and `letters` as a string. The current value of `sortedPassword` is equal to the value of `password`.**
