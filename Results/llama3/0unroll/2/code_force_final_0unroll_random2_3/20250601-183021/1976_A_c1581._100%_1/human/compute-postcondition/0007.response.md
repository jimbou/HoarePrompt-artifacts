Output State: **The program returns True, indicating that the digits list is sorted in ascending order and the last digit is not greater than any letter in the letters list. The state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `sortedPassword` is still equal to the value of `password`, which is the concatenation of the sorted `digits` and `letters` as a string.**
