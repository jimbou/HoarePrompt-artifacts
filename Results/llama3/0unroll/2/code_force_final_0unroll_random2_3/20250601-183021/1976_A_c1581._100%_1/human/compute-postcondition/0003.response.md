Output State: **password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, digits is a sorted list of all the digits in the password string, letters is a sorted list of all the letters in the password string.**

The code sorts the lists of digits and letters in ascending order, but does not modify the password string itself. The password remains a string of exactly n characters, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The digits and letters lists are updated to be in sorted order, but their contents remain the same.
