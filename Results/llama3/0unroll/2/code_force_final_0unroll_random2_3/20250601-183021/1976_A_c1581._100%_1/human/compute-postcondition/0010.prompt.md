You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop will return False if the digits list is not sorted in ascending order or if the last digit is greater than any letter in the letters list. Otherwise, the loop will finish all iterations without returning False, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the digits list is sorted in ascending order and the last digit is not greater than any letter in the letters list. The state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `sortedPassword` is still equal to the value of `password`, which is the concatenation of the sorted `digits` and `letters` as a string.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the digits list is not sorted in ascending order or the last digit is greater than any letter in the letters list.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True, indicating that the digits list is sorted in ascending order and the last digit is not greater than any letter in the letters list. The state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `sortedPassword` is still equal to the value of `password`, which is the concatenation of the sorted `digits` and `letters` as a string.

Case_2: The program returns False, indicating that the digits list is not sorted in ascending order or the last digit is greater than any letter in the letters list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
