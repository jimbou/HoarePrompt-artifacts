#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where n is a positive integer, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop will return False if the digits list is not sorted in ascending order or if the last digit is greater than any letter in the letters list. Otherwise, the loop will finish all iterations without returning False, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the digits list is sorted in ascending order and the last digit is not greater than any letter in the letters list. The state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `sortedPassword` is still equal to the value of `password`, which is the concatenation of the sorted `digits` and `letters` as a string.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the digits list is not sorted in ascending order or the last digit is greater than any letter in the letters list.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if the digits in a password string are sorted in ascending order and not greater than any letter in the password.
