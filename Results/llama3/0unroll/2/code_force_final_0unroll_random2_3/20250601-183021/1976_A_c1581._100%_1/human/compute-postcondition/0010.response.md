Functionality: **Checks if the digits in a password string are sorted in ascending order and not greater than any letter in the password.**

This function takes a password string as input, extracts its digits and letters, and checks if the digits are sorted in ascending order. It also verifies that the last digit is not greater than any letter in the password. If both conditions are met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not modify the original password string.
