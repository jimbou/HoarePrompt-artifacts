Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program calculates the sum of the counts of each unique integer in the list divided by 3, but this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally. The optimal strategy is to play the cards that have a pair in the hand, because this will guarantee a point. The program should count the number of pairs in the hand, not the sum of the counts of each unique integer divided by 3.

Correctness: **False**
