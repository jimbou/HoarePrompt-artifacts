Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input and stores it in the `cases` list.
2. It then iterates over each test case in the `cases` list.
3. For each test case, it creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements in arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
4. It then creates sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` to store the elements in `unique_a` and `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
5. It calculates the number of elements that are only in `a` (`only_a`), only in `b` (`only_b`), and in both `a` and `b` (`both`).
6. It checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` is greater than `k/2`. If so, it returns 'NO' because it is not possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from both arrays.
7. It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (`total_distinct`) is less than `k`. If so, it returns 'NO' because it is not possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from both arrays.
8. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES' because it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from both arrays.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
