Output State: The value of `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the corresponding test case has a total of at least `k` distinct elements in `a` and `b`, with no more than `k // 2` elements unique to either `a` or `b`. The values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
