Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`, such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2*10^5, 2 <= `k` <= 2*min(`n`, `m`), `k` is even, and 1 <= `a_i`, `b_j` <= 10^6 for all `i` and `j`, and `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `t` remains a positive integer, and the `cases` list remains unchanged with its properties. A new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list, ready to store the results of the test cases.
