Functionality: **This function evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers (n, m, k) and two lists of integers (a, b), and returns a list of strings ('YES' or 'NO') indicating whether each test case meets certain conditions. The function checks if the number of unique elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k, and the total number of distinct elements, meet specific criteria. If the conditions are met, the function returns 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The function processes all test cases in the input list and returns the results as a list of strings.**
