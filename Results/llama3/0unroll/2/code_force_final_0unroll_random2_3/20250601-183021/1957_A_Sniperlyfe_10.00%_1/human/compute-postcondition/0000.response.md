Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 100), `freq` is an empty dictionary**.

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing integers representing the lengths of sticks, with a length of n between 1 and 100. A new variable `freq` is introduced, which is an empty dictionary, ready to store frequency information.
