#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 100).
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique lengths of sticks and the values are their respective frequencies, `arr` remains unchanged.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of the frequencies of unique stick lengths by 4.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers representing stick lengths as input, calculates the frequency of each unique length, and returns the sum of the integer divisions of these frequencies by 4, effectively counting the number of sets of four sticks that can be formed from the input list, without modifying the original list.
