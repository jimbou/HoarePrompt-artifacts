Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a specific problem, but the provided functions do not match the problem description. The problem description asks for the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided functions seem to be related to a different problem, where the goal is to calculate the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a given path, considering that '*' characters block the path and cannot be traversed.

The first function, `func_1`, calculates the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a given path, but it does not take into account the periodicities of the signs or the year in which the n-th sign will occur. The second function, `func_2`, reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of strings, extracts a positive integer t and pairs of positive integers or convertible strings and paths, applies `func_1` to each path, stores the results in a list, and prints each result on a new line. However, it does not calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Therefore, the given program does not meet the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
