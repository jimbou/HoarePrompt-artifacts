Reasoning:

The provided program is not correct for the given problem. Here's why:

1. The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. However, `func_1` is not relevant to the problem at hand, as it seems to be solving a different problem involving a path with '@' and '*' characters. The problem statement does not mention anything about a path or these characters.

2. `func_2` is supposed to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs. However, `func_2` does not perform this calculation. Instead, it calls `func_1` with a string input, which is not relevant to the problem.

3. The program does not correctly read the input data. The problem statement specifies that the input should contain the number of test cases, followed by the number of signs and the periodicities of the signs for each test case. However, the program does not correctly parse this input data.

4. The program does not produce the correct output. The problem statement requires outputting the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case. However, the program does not calculate this year correctly.

In summary, the program does not correctly solve the problem, and its output is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
