Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 1, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[0]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros. The current value of `path[1]` is '*'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of characters `path` remains the same, the number of characters `n` in `path` is still larger than 1, and the list `dp` has been updated such that the second element `dp[1]` is now negative infinity, while the first element `dp[0]` and the rest of the elements remain the same. The first character of `path` is still either '@' or '*', and the second character `path[1]` is still '*'.
