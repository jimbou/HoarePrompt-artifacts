Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 1, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[0]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `dp[0]` plus 1 if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is `dp[0]` and the rest are zeros.**

In natural language, the output state is: The path and the number of characters in the path remain the same. The dynamic programming list dp has been updated such that the second element dp[1] is now the first element dp[0] plus 1 if the second character in the path is '@', otherwise it is the same as dp[0]. The rest of the elements in dp remain zeros.
