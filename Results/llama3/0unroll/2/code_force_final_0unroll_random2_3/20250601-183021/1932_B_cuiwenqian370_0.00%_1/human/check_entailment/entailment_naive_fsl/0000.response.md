Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a program that calculates the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program appears to be a solution to a different problem, involving a path with '@' and '*' characters.

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but neither of them seems to be related to the problem description. `func_1` appears to be a dynamic programming solution to a problem involving a path, and `func_2` reads input from standard input and calls `func_1` with the input data.

To solve the original problem, a different approach is needed. A correct solution would involve iterating over the periodicities of the signs, calculating the year in which each sign will occur, and updating the current year accordingly.

For example, a correct solution could be:

```python
def apocalypse_year(signs):
    year = 0
    for sign in signs:
        year += sign - (year % sign)
    return year

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    signs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(apocalypse_year(signs))
```

This solution iterates over the periodicities of the signs, calculates the year in which each sign will occur, and updates the current year accordingly. It then prints the final year in which the n-th sign will occur.
