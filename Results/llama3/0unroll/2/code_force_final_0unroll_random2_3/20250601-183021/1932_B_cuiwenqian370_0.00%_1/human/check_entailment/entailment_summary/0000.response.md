Reasoning: 
The given program does not match the problem description. The problem description requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided functions do not seem to be related to this problem.

Function 1 appears to be calculating the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a given path, considering that '*' characters block the path and cannot be traversed. This function does not seem to be relevant to the problem of finding the year of the apocalypse.

Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of strings, extracts a positive integer t and pairs of positive integers or convertible strings and paths, applies func_1 to each path, stores the results in a list, and prints each result on a new line. Again, this function does not seem to be related to the problem of finding the year of the apocalypse.

Therefore, the given program is not correct for the provided problem description.

Correctness: **False**
