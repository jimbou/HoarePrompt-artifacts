Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf'). If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is `dp[0]` plus 1. If the second character of `path` is neither '*' nor '@', then `dp[1]` is `dp[0]`. The rest of the values in `dp` are zeros.

    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` after the loop executes all the iterations is a list where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached up to index `i` in the `path` list, considering that '*' characters block the path and cannot be traversed. The values in `dp` are calculated based on the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached from the previous two indices (`dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`) plus 1 if the current character at index `i` is '@', or 0 if it's not '@'. If the current character is '*', `dp[i]` is set to -float('inf') to indicate that the path is blocked. The rest of the variables (`path` and `n`) remain unchanged.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in the `path` list, considering that '*' characters block the path and cannot be traversed. This maximum number is calculated based on the values in the `dp` list, which represents the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached up to each index in the `path` list. The returned value is the maximum of all values in `dp` that are greater than negative infinity, indicating that the path is not blocked.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a given path, considering that '*' characters block the path and cannot be traversed. It takes a list of characters as input, where each character is either '@' or '*', and returns the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0. The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached up to each index in the path, and returns the maximum of these values. If the path is blocked by '*' characters, the function returns the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached before the blockage.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: data is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer, and the rest of the elements are either positive integers or strings that can be converted to positive integers, and the list has at least two elements.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed t times, and the results list now contains t elements, each of which is the result of calling func_1 with the corresponding path from the data list. The index variable has been incremented by 2t, and the stdin remains empty.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed t times, and the results list remains unchanged, containing t elements, each of which is the result of calling func_1 with the corresponding path from the data list. The index variable has been incremented by 2t, and the stdin is now filled with the t results from the results list, each printed on a new line.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of strings, extracts a positive integer t and pairs of positive integers or convertible strings and paths, applies func_1 to each path, stores the results in a list, and prints each result on a new line, leaving the standard input empty and the results list unchanged.
