Output State: The `dp` list contains the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached at each position in the `path` list, considering the constraints imposed by '*' characters. The value at each position `i` in `dp` is the maximum of the values at positions `i-1` and `i-2`, plus 1 if the character at position `i` in `path` is '@', and 0 otherwise. If the character at position `i` in `path` is '*', the value at position `i` in `dp` is -float('inf'). The values in `path` and `n` remain unchanged.
