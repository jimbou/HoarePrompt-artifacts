Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros. The first character of `path` is '@'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `path` remains the same, containing characters '@' or '*', and its length `n` is still greater than 0. The list `dp` has been updated, where the first element `dp[0]` is now 1, and the rest of the elements remain zeros. The first character of `path` is still '@'.
