Reasoning:

The provided code does not match the problem description. The problem description is about calculating the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided code appears to be solving a different problem, possibly related to pathfinding or dynamic programming.

The code defines two functions, but neither of them seems to be related to the problem description. The first function appears to be calculating the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in a path, considering '*' characters as blockers. The second function reads input from stdin, calls the first function with the input data, and prints the results.

Since the code does not match the problem description, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
