Output State: **The program returns the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in the `path` list, considering that '*' characters block the path and cannot be traversed. This maximum number is calculated based on the values in the `dp` list, which represents the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached up to each index in the `path` list. The returned value is the maximum of all values in `dp` that are greater than negative infinity, indicating that the path is not blocked.**
