Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0, `dp` is a list of `n` values. If `n` is 1, `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[0]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are zeros. If `n` is larger than 1, `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[0]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[0]` is 0. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf'). If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is `dp[0]` plus 1. If the second character of `path` is neither '*' nor '@', then `dp[1]` is `dp[0]`. The rest of the values in `dp` are zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(2, n):
    if path[i] == '*':
        dp[i] = -float('inf')
    else:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
