Postcondition: ***`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 1, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[0]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[0]` is 0. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -float('inf'). If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is `dp[0]` plus 1. If the second character of `path` is neither '*' nor '@', then `dp[1]` is `dp[0]`. The rest of the values in `dp` are zeros.***
