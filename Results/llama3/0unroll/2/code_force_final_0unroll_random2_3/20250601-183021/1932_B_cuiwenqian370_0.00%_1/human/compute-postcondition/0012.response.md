Postcondition: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 1, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[0]` is -float('inf') if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise `dp[0]` is 0 and the rest are zeros.**
