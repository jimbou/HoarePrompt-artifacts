Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is larger than 0, `dp` is a list of `n` numbers where the first number is -float('inf') and the rest are zeros. The first character of `path` is '*', and from now on, the first character of `path` is not '@'.**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that the first element of the `dp` list is now `-float('inf')`, which is a very large negative number. The other elements of `dp` remain zeros. The values of `path` and `n` are unchanged.
