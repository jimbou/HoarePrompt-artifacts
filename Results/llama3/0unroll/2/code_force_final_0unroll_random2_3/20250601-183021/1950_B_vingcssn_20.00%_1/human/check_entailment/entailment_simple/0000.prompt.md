Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    2
    
    3

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 20) followed by t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 20).
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of printed patterns, each corresponding to the input integer `n` read from stdin. The patterns will be printed in the format specified in the loop body, with each pattern consisting of a series of '#' and '.' characters. The number of patterns printed will be equal to the value of `casos`, which is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive).
