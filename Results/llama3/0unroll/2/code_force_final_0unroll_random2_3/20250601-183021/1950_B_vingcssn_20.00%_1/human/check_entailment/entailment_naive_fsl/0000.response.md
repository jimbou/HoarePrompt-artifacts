Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It only handles the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and does not provide a general solution for any value of n. For example, if n is 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of the correct checkerboard.

A correct solution would involve using nested loops to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n. Here is an example of a correct solution:
```
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(2*n):
            for j in range(2*n):
                if (i+j) % 2 == 0:
                    print('#', end='')
                else:
                    print('.', end='')
            print()
```
This solution uses two nested loops to generate the checkerboard pattern. The outer loop iterates over the rows of the checkerboard, and the inner loop iterates over the columns. The `if` statement checks whether the sum of the row and column indices is even or odd, and prints a '#' or '.' accordingly.
