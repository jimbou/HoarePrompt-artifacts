Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it only handles specific cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. It does not provide a general solution for any value of n within the given range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For any value of n outside of these specific cases, the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern.

Correctness: **False**
