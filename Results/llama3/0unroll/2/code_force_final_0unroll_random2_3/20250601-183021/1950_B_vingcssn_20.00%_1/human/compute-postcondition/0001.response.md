Output State: The output state will be a series of printed patterns, each corresponding to the input number `n` read from stdin. The patterns will be printed in the format specified in the loop body, with the number of repetitions determined by the value of `n`. The output will not include any values of `n` that are not in the range 1-4, as these will print 'No esta en el rango'. The value of `casos` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
