Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for all possible values of `n`. The program only handles the cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and prints a predefined pattern for each of these cases. However, the problem statement requires the program to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of `n` between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

For values of `n` greater than 4, the program prints the message "No esta en el rango", which is not the correct output according to the problem statement. The program should instead generate the correct checkerboard pattern for these values of `n`.

To fix this issue, the program should use a loop to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of `n`, rather than relying on predefined patterns for specific values of `n`.

Correctness: **False**
