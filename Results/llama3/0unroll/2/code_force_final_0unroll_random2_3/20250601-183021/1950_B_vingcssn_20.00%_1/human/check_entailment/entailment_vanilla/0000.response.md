Reasoning:

The given program is designed to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard made of 2x2 squares alternating '#' and '.' characters, with the top-left cell being '#'. The program takes an integer n as input and outputs the corresponding checkerboard.

However, the program has a significant flaw. It only handles specific cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and for any other value of n, it prints 'No esta en el rango' (which means 'Not in the range' in Spanish). This means that the program does not correctly handle all possible values of n within the specified range of 1 to 20.

A correct program should be able to generate the checkerboard for any value of n within the specified range, not just specific cases. The program should use a loop or recursive approach to generate the checkerboard pattern for any given n.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
