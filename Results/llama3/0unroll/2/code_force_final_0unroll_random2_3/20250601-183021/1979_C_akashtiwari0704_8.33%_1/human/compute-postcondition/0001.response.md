Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 't' remains unchanged, stdin is empty, and the console contains the output of the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the sum of the modified array elements is greater than or equal to the product of the original array elements, the console contains '-1'. Otherwise, the console contains the modified array elements separated by spaces.**
