Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the product of these integers, then for each integer, it calculates the product of all other integers and sums these values. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product of all integers, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the modified array elements separated by spaces. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding output for each case.**
