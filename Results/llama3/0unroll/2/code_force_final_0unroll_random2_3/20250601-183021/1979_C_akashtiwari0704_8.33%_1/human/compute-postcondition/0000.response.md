The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,…,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). The first line of the first test case is accepted and converted to an integer and assigned to `t`. So stdin now contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,…,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) of the first test case is left. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer larger than or equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,…,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) of the first test case is left.
Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than or equal to 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains n integers k_1,k_2,…,k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) of the first test case is left.**
