Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program calculates the product of all the multipliers (k_i) for each outcome, then for each outcome, it calculates the product of all other multipliers and assigns this value as the bet for that outcome. The program then checks if the sum of all bets is greater than or equal to the product of all multipliers. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This is achieved by assigning the product of all other multipliers as the bet for each outcome, which guarantees that the sum of all bets is less than the product of all multipliers.

Correctness: **True**
