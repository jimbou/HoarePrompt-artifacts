Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a list of multipliers that are all equal to 2. In this case, the program will calculate the product of the multipliers as 2^n, where n is the number of outcomes. However, when it calculates the sum of the bets, it will be 2^(n-1), which is not strictly less than 2^n. Therefore, the program will incorrectly print -1.

For example, if the input is [2, 2, 2], the program will calculate the product as 8 and the sum of the bets as 4, which is not strictly less than 8. Therefore, the program will incorrectly print -1.

The correct solution should handle this case by checking if the sum of the bets is strictly less than the product of the multipliers, and if not, it should print -1.
