Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by playing optimally. It first counts the frequency of each number in the hand using the `cnt` array. Then, it iterates over the `cnt` array and adds the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 to the answer. This is because if a number appears more than once in the hand, it can be played to score points, and the maximum number of points that can be scored is the count minus 1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including when a number appears only once in the hand (in which case it cannot be played to score points), when a number appears multiple times in the hand (in which case it can be played to score points), and when the hand is empty (in which case the answer is 0).

The program also correctly assumes that Nene plays optimally, which means that she will always play a card that will maximize her score and minimize the player's score. The program takes this into account by only counting the maximum number of points that can be scored by playing optimally.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
