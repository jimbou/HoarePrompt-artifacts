Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of points a player can get by taking their turns optimally in a card game. The game is played with a deck of 2n cards, where each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each integer appears exactly twice. The player and their opponent, Nene, take turns selecting cards from their hand and placing them on the table. The player receives a point if there is already a card with the same integer on the table.

The given program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It first reads the input and initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the player's hand. Then, it iterates over the count array and adds the maximum of 0 and `x - 1` to the answer, where `x` is the frequency of each integer. This is because if an integer appears more than once in the player's hand, they can get a point for each additional occurrence.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases. The time complexity of the program is O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
