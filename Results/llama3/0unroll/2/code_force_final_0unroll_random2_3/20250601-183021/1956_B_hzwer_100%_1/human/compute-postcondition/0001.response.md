Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is the final state of the variables after the last iteration. The variable 'ans' holds the total count of pairs of identical integers in all test cases, and the variable 'cnt' holds the count of each integer in the last test case. The input buffer is empty, and the loop variables '_', 'n', 'a', and 'x' hold the values from the last iteration.**
