Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by taking turns optimally in the card game.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the number of cards in each test case, and the integers on the cards.
2.  It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of the occurrences of each integer from 1 to `n`.
3.  The program then iterates through the list of integers `a` and increments the corresponding count in the `cnt` array for each integer.
4.  After counting the occurrences of each integer, the program calculates the total number of pairs of identical integers by summing up the maximum of 0 and `x - 1` for each count `x` in the `cnt` array. This is because if an integer appears `x` times, there are `x - 1` pairs that can be formed.
5.  Finally, the program prints the total count of pairs, which represents the maximum number of points that can be scored.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to maximize the number of points that can be scored in the card game.

Correctness: **True**
