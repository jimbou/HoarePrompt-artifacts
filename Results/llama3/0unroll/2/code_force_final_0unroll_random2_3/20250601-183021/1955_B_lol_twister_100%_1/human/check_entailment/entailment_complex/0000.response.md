Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list of integers `l`.
2. It correctly calculates the value of `a` as the minimum value in the list `l`.
3. It correctly constructs the list `li` by iterating over the rows and columns of the progressive square and calculating the values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
4. It correctly sorts both lists `l` and `li`.
5. It correctly checks if the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal, and returns 'yes' if they are, and 'no' otherwise.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules of the progressive square as described in the problem statement. The use of sorting to compare the lists is also correct, as it allows the program to efficiently check if the elements of `l` can be rearranged into the specific pattern described by `li`.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
