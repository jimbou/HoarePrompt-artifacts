Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is 1, li is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 + n * c + n * d for all b_i in li.**

The code sorts the lists `l` and `li` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and `a` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The lists `l` and `li` are sorted, but their elements still satisfy the same conditions as before, with the added property of being in ascending order.
