Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining if a given array of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square based on the provided rules.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the square (n), and the values of c and d.

3. It then reads the array of integers (l) and passes these values to the function func_1.

4. The function func_1 calculates the value of a (the smallest element in the array), and then constructs a list (li) of elements that would be present in the progressive square based on the given rules.

5. It sorts both the constructed list (li) and the input array (l), and then checks if they are equal.

6. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array can be rearranged into a progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program's logic is correct and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
