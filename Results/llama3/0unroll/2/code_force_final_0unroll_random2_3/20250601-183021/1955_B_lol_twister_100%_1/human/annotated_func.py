#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l.
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is 1, li is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 + n * c + n * d for all b_i in li.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns the string 'yes'.
    #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l, a is 1, li is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 + n * c + n * d for all b_i in li. l and li are not equal
    return 'no'
    #The program returns the string 'no'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given list of integers can be rearranged into a specific pattern. It takes as input a list of n^2 integers, and two integers c and d, and returns 'yes' if the list can be rearranged into a sorted list of integers in the form a + k*c + h*d, where a is the minimum value in the list, and 'no' otherwise. The function modifies the input list by sorting it.
