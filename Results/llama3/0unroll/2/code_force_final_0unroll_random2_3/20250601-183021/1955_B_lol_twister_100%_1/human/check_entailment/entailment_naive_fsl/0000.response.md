Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given array elements can form such a square. The function `func_1` calculates the expected elements of the progressive square based on the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, and then compares them with the given array elements. If the two lists are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array elements can form a progressive square; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where the array elements are not in the correct order, as it sorts both lists before comparing them. It also handles the case where the array elements are not unique, as it uses the `min` function to find the smallest element, which is used as the starting point for calculating the expected elements of the progressive square.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square. Therefore, it is correct for all potential cases, and the correctness is **True**.
