Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the input values of n, c, and d, and the list of integers l.
2. It then calculates the value of a by finding the minimum value in the list l. This is correct because the problem statement guarantees that there exists exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules, and the value of a is the smallest value in the square.
3. The program then constructs the list li by iterating over the rows and columns of the square and calculating the values of the elements using the formula a + k * c + d * h. This is correct because the problem statement defines the progressive square using this formula.
4. The program then sorts both lists l and li. This is correct because the problem statement requires the elements of the square to be in random order, and sorting the lists ensures that the elements are in the correct order for comparison.
5. Finally, the program compares the sorted lists l and li. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that a progressive square can be constructed from the array elements. If they are not equal, it returns 'no'.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the execution states provided as comments confirm that the program is correct.
