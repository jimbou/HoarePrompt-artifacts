Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square according to the rules specified in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first reads the input values of n, c, and d, and the list of integers l.
2. It then finds the minimum value in the list l, which represents the value of a_{1,1} in the progressive square.
3. It constructs a list li of integers in the form a + k*c + h*d, where a is the minimum value in the list, and k and h are indices ranging from 0 to n-1. This list represents the elements of the progressive square.
4. It sorts both the list li and the input list l.
5. It then compares the sorted lists li and l. If they are equal, it means that the input list l can be rearranged into a progressive square according to the rules, and the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given list of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
