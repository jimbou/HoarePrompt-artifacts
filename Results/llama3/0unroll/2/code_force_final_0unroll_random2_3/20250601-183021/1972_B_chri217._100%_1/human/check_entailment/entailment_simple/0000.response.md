Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads the input from stdin, parses it, and returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of 'U' and 'D' characters. `func_2` takes a tuple `(n, s)` as input and returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.

The key insight to the problem is that the game can be won by the player who can make the last move, which is only possible if there is an odd number of 'U' characters in the string. This is because each move removes one 'U' character and flips two adjacent characters, which can only change the parity of the number of 'U' characters if there is an odd number of 'U' characters initially.

The program correctly implements this insight by counting the number of 'U' characters in the string and returning 'YES' if the count is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
