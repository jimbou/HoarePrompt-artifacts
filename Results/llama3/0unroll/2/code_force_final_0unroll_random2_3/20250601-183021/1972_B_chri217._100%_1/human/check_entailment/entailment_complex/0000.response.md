Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win the game if both players play optimally. The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

Function 1 reads the input from standard input, parses it into a list of tuples, and returns the list. Each tuple contains a positive integer n and a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D" characters.

Function 2 determines whether the number of 'U' characters in the second element of the `case` list is odd or even, returning 'YES' for odd counts and 'NO' for even counts.

The key insight to the problem is that the game can be won by the player who can make the last move, which is the player who can remove the last facing-up coin. This happens when the number of facing-up coins is odd. Therefore, the correct strategy is to count the number of 'U' characters in the string and return 'YES' if the count is odd, indicating that Alice will win, and 'NO' otherwise, indicating that Bob will win.

The provided code correctly implements this strategy. Function 1 reads the input and prepares the data, and Function 2 applies the correct logic to determine the winner.

Correctness: **True**
