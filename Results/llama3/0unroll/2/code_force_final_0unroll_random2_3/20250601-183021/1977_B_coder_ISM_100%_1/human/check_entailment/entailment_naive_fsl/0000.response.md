Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. It takes an integer x as input and generates an array of integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1} that satisfies the given conditions.

The program first converts the input integer x to a binary string, and then iterates through the string to generate the array. It uses a flag to keep track of whether the previous element was 1 or -1, and adjusts the current element accordingly to ensure that there are no consecutive non-zero elements.

The program also handles the case where the last element is 1 and the flag is set, by appending an additional element to the array.

The program's logic seems sound, and it correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description. After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
