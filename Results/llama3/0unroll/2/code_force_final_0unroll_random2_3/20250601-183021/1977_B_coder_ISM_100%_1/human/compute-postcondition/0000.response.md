Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, because one test case has been read and assigned to `t`.
