You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 ≤ x < 2^30).
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        
        s = []
        
        length = 30
        
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')

                pass
        
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        
        print(length)
        
        print(*s)
        
    #State: The loop has executed t times, and for each execution, it has printed the length of the list s and the elements of the list s. The list s represents a binary number with some modifications. The modifications are as follows: if two consecutive bits are 1, the first bit is changed to -1 and the second bit is changed to 0. If a bit is -1 and the previous bit is 1, the -1 is moved to the previous bit and the current bit is changed to 0. If the last bit is 0 and the flag is 1, the last bit is changed to 1. If the last bit is 1 and the flag is 1, the last bit is changed to 0 and a new bit 1 is appended to the list. The flag is initially 0 and is set to 1 when two consecutive bits are 1. The flag is reset to 0 when a bit is changed from 0 to 1. The loop has finished executing, and the output state is the final state of the variables after all iterations.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
