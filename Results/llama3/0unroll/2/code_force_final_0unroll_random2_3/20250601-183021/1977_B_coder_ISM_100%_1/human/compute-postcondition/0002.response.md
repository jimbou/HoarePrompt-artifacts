Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a single positive integer x. It converts each integer into a binary representation as a list of characters, applies a series of modifications to the binary representation, and then prints the length of the modified binary representation and its elements. The modifications involve changing consecutive '1' bits to '-1' and '0', moving '-1' bits to the previous position if the current bit is '1', and appending or modifying the last bit based on a flag that tracks the presence of consecutive '1' bits. The function repeats this process for each test case and outputs the modified binary representations.**
