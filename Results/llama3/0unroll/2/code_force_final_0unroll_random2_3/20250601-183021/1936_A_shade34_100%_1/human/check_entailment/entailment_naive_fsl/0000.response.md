Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ^ p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`. The program uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum value of `p_i ^ p_j` by iteratively asking queries to the jury.

Here's a high-level explanation of the program's logic:

1. The program first finds the index `mak` that corresponds to the maximum value of `p_i` by asking queries of the form `? mak mak i i` and updating `mak` based on the jury's response.
2. Once `mak` is found, the program finds all indices `i` such that `p_i` is equal to `p_mak` by asking queries of the form `? mak mak2 i mak2` and adding `i` to the list `pans` if the jury responds with `=`.
3. The program then finds the index `mak` that corresponds to the maximum value of `p_i ^ p_j` among the indices in `pans` by asking queries of the form `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]` and updating `mak` based on the jury's response.
4. Finally, the program prints the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the solution.

The program's logic appears to be correct, and it should work for all possible inputs. The use of binary search-like approach ensures that the program asks at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit. Additionally, the program's logic is robust and should handle all possible edge cases.

Therefore, based on the provided code and the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
