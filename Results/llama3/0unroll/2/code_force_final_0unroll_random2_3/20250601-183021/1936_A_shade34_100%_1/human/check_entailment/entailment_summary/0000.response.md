Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses a series of queries to find the maximum and minimum elements in the permutation, and it outputs their indices in the correct format. The program first finds the maximum element by comparing each element with the current maximum, and then it finds the minimum element by comparing each element with the current minimum. The program uses the bitwise OR operation to compare elements, which is a valid approach for this problem.

The program also handles the case where there are multiple minimum elements by keeping track of all elements that are equal to the current minimum. It then finds the minimum element among these elements by comparing them with each other.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the permutation. This is because it performs a constant number of queries for each element in the permutation. The program's space complexity is also O(n), as it needs to store the indices of the minimum elements.

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
