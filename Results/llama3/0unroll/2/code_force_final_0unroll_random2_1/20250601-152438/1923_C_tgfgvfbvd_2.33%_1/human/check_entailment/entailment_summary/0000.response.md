Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `c` itself, and the queries with start and end indices.
2.  It calculates the prefix sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. This is an efficient way to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.
3.  For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray from the start index `a` to the end index `b` by subtracting the prefix sum at `a-2` from the prefix sum at `b-1`. This correctly handles the case where `a` is 1.
4.  It checks the condition for a good subarray: the sum of the subarray must be greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is done by comparing the sum `s` with `2 * (b - a + 1)`.
5.  If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
