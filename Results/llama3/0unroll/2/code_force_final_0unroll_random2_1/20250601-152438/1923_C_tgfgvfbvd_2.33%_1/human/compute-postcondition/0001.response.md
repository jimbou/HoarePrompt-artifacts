Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers and multiple queries. For each query, it determines whether the sum of the subarray from the given start index to the end index is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray, and outputs 'YES' if true and 'NO' otherwise. The function iterates through all test cases and queries, providing a series of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs indicating the result of each query.**
