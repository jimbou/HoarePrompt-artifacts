Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' for each query in each test case, indicating whether the sum of the subarray from index a to b is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs is equal to the total number of queries across all test cases.**
