Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of each test case is the length of the list of integers, the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers contains positive integers. The queries contain two integers each, the first integer is the start index of the subarray and the second integer is the end index of the subarray. The start index and end index are 1-indexed. The number of queries does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The length of the list of integers does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of the length of the list of integers over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = []
    c = 0
    for x in l:
        c += x
        p.append(c)
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        s = p[b - 1]
        if a - 2 >= 0:
            s -= p[a - 2]
        if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
