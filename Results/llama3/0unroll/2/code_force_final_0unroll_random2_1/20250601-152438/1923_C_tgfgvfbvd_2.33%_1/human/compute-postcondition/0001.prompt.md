You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of each test case is the length of the list of integers, the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers contains positive integers. The queries contain two integers each, the first integer is the start index of the subarray and the second integer is the end index of the subarray. The start index and end index are 1-indexed. The number of queries does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The length of the list of integers does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of the length of the list of integers over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' for each query in each test case, indicating whether the sum of the subarray from index a to b is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' outputs is equal to the total number of queries across all test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
