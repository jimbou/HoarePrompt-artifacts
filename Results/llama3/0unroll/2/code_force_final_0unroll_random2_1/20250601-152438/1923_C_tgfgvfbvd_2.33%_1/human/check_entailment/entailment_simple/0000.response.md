Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is good based on the conditions provided. The program calculates the prefix sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. Then, for each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray from index `a` to `b` by subtracting the prefix sum at index `a-2` from the prefix sum at index `b-1`. 

The program then checks if the length of the subarray is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The reasoning behind this approach is that if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray, it is possible to construct an array `b` that satisfies the conditions of the problem. Specifically, we can set `b_i = 2` for all `i` in the subarray, and then adjust the values of `b_i` to make the sum of `b` equal to the sum of the subarray. This is possible because the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray, so we have enough "extra" value to distribute among the elements of `b` to make them all greater than 1.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.
