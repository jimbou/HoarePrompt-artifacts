Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of integers, and then multiple lines each containing two integers. The first integer is the number of test cases. The first integer of each test case is the length of the list of integers, the second integer is the number of queries. The list of integers contains positive integers. The queries contain two integers each, the first integer is the start index of the subarray and the second integer is the end index of the subarray. The start index and end index are 1-indexed. The number of queries does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The length of the list of integers does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of the length of the list of integers over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
