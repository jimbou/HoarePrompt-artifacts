Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `c` itself, and the queries (start and end indices).

2. It correctly calculates the prefix sum array `p`, where `p[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array `c`. This is done to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

3. For each query, it correctly calculates the sum of the subarray from index `a` to `b` using the prefix sum array `p`. If `a` is not 1, it subtracts the sum of the first `a-1` elements from the sum of the first `b` elements.

4. It then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is the condition for a subarray to be "good" according to the problem statement.

5. If the condition is met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

6. The program correctly handles the case where `a` is 1, in which case it doesn't subtract anything from the sum of the first `b` elements.

7. The program also correctly handles the case where `b-a+1` is 1, in which case it doesn't check the condition and directly prints "NO", because a single-element subarray cannot be "good" according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
