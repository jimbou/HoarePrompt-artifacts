Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score that can be obtained by rearranging the cards. The program first sorts the array of card counts, then iterates through the sorted array to find the maximum value that is less than or equal to the sum of the smallest integer and k divided by the number of integers. If k is not exhausted, it calculates the number of elements less than or equal to the maximum value, plus the remainder of k divided by the number of integers, plus the number of elements greater than the maximum value. The program prints the result for each test case.

The program correctly handles the case where k is not exhausted, and it correctly calculates the number of elements less than or equal to the maximum value, plus the remainder of k divided by the number of integers, plus the number of elements greater than the maximum value.

The program also correctly handles the case where k is exhausted, and it correctly prints the result for each test case.

Overall, the program is correct and it should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
