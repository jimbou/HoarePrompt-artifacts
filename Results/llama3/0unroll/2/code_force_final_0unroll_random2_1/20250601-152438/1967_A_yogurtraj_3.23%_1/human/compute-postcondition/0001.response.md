Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers, then iterates through the sorted list to find the maximum value that is less than or equal to the sum of the smallest integer and k divided by the number of integers. If k is not exhausted, it calculates the number of elements less than or equal to the maximum value, plus the remainder of k divided by the number of integers, plus the number of elements greater than the maximum value. The function prints the result for each test case.**
