Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
3. It generates a random permutation `s2` of the input string `s` using `random.sample`.
4. It checks if the original string `s` is not equal to the randomly generated string `s2`. If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" followed by the randomly generated string `s2`.
5. If the randomly generated string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it prints "No".

The program correctly implements the problem statement. It generates a random permutation of the input string and checks if it is different from the original string. If it is, it prints the permutation; otherwise, it prints "No".

Correctness: **True**
