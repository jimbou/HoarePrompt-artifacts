This function generates and prints random permutations of input strings. It reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings. For each string, it generates a random permutation and checks if it is different from the original string. If it is, the function prints 'Yes' followed by the permuted string. If the permuted string is the same as the original, it prints 'No'. The function repeats this process t times, printing the results for each input string.
