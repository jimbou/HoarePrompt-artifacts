Correctness: **False**.

The program does not guarantee that the rearranged string `s2` will be different from the original string `s`. In the case where the input string `s` has only one unique character (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will always output "No", which is correct. However, when the input string `s` has more than one unique character, the program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the characters. 

Although the probability of generating the same string is low, it is not impossible. In the worst-case scenario, the program might generate the same string `s` multiple times, leading to incorrect output. 

For example, if the input is "ab", the program might generate "ab" again, which is the same as the original string, and output "No" incorrectly. 

To fix this issue, the program should ensure that the generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s` by using a different approach, such as sorting the characters or using a more sophisticated algorithm to generate a unique permutation.
