Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with one line less in each test case, times is an integer, check is 2147483647**

The first line of the code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `times`. This means that the first line of each test case in the input is consumed, leaving one line less in each test case. The value of `times` is an integer, but its exact value depends on the input.

The second line of the code assigns the value of `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`. This is a constant value, which is `2147483647`. This line does not affect any other variables or the input.

Therefore, after executing the entire code block, the output state is that `stdin` contains multiple test cases with one line less in each test case, `times` is an integer, and `check` is `2147483647`.
