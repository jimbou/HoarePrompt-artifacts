Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it prints the answer for each test case multiple times, once for each number in the input. This is because the print statement is inside the loop that processes the input numbers. The correct behavior should be to print the answer only once for each test case, after all numbers have been processed.

To fix this, the print statement should be moved outside the loop that processes the input numbers, so that it only prints the answer once for each test case.
