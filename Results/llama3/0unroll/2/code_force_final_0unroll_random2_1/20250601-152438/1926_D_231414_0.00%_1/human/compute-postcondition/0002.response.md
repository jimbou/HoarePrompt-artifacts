Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n space-separated integers. It then processes each test case by iterating through the integers, performing bitwise XOR operations with a predefined constant (2^31 - 1), and maintaining a dictionary to keep track of the count of each integer and its XOR result. The function prints the updated count of integers that do not have a pair with the same XOR result after each iteration. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and sets the variable 'times' to 0.**
