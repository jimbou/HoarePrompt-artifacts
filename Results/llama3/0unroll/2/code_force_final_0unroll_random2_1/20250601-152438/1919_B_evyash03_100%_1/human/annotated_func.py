#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, and `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters in the string `expression`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters in a given string expression. It takes a string expression as input and returns an integer value representing the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters.
