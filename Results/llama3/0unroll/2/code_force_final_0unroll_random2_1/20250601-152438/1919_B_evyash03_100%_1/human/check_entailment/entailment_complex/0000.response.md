Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting a given array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by finding the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters in the string. This is because the penalty for a subarray is minimized when the sum of the subarray is zero, which occurs when the number of "+" and "-" characters is equal. By finding the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters, the program effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
