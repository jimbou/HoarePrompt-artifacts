Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string expression and its length as input. It counts the number of "+" characters in the expression and calculates the absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is correct because it effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty by considering the optimal way to split the array into subarrays. The absolute difference between the counts of "+" and "-" characters represents the minimum possible penalty, as it corresponds to the sum of the penalties of the subarrays.

Correctness: **True**
