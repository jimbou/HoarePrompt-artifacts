Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays with equal sums. The function `func_1` takes the input string `expression` and its length `length` as parameters. It counts the number of '+' characters in the string and calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count of '+' characters from the length of the string. The function then returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program works correctly for all potential cases because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays with equal sums. The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input string contains only '+' or '-' characters.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
