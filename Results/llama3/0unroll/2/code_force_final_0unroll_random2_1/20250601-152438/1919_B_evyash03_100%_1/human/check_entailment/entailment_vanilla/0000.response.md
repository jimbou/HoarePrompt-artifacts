Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the minimum possible penalty for a given string `expression` of length `length`. It initializes a count variable to 0 and then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is '+', it increments the count. After the loop, it calculates the number of '-' characters by subtracting the count from the length of the string. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters.

The main part of the program calls the `func_1` function for each test case and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It splits the array into subarrays by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters, and then calculates the penalty for each subarray by taking the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters. The program also handles the case where the number of '+' characters is equal to the number of '-' characters, in which case the penalty is 0.

Correctness: **True**
