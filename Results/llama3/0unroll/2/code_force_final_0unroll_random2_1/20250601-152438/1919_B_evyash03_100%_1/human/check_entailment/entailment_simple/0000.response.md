Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `expression` and its length `length` as input. It then counts the number of "+" characters in the string and calculates the number of "-" characters by subtracting the count from the length. Finally, it returns the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters.

The key insight here is that the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is either 1 or -1. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the absolute value of 1 or -1 is 1.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by returning the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters. This is because the absolute difference represents the minimum number of subarrays needed to achieve a sum of 1 or -1 for each subarray, and the penalty for each subarray is 1.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
