Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's why:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of the river, given the depth of the river cells and the maximum distance between supports (d).

2. Function `func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance between supports (d) as input. It modifies the row by incrementing the first d-1 elements by 1 and updating the remaining elements to be the sum of the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements (or 0 if the element is the first) and the original value of the element plus 1. This effectively calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single bridge on the given row.

3. Function `func_2` reads the input, applies `func_1` to each row of the river, and calculates the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list. This effectively finds the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

4. The program prints the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of the river, which is the required output.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.
