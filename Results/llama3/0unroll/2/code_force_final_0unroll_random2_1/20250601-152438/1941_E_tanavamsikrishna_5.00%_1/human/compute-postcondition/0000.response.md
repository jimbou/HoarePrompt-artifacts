The code snippet provided reads input from stdin to update the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then constructs a 2D list `rows` from subsequent inputs. It also defines two new lists: `costs` and `total_costs`. The `costs` list is populated by applying the `func_1` function to each row in `rows`, with `d` as an argument. The `total_costs` list is initialized but not populated within the given code snippet.

Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are updated with integer values from stdin.
- `rows` is populated with a 2D list of non-negative integers, representing the depths of the river cells.
- `costs` is populated with the results of applying `func_1` to each row in `rows`, using `d` as an argument.
- `total_costs` is initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers, costs is a list of results from func_1 applied to each row in rows with d as an argument, total_costs is an empty list, stdin is empty.**
