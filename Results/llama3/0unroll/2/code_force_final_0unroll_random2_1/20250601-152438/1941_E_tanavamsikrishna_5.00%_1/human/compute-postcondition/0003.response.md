Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers, which means they have specific numerical values.
* `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers, which means it's a list of lists containing integers greater than or equal to 0.
* `costs` is a list of results from applying `func_1` to each row in `rows` with `d` as an argument. This means that `func_1` is a function that takes a row and an integer `d` as input and returns a value, which is stored in the `costs` list.
* `total_costs` is a list of sums of sublists of `costs` of length `k`. This means that `total_costs` is a list of sums of consecutive `k` elements in the `costs` list.

Now, let's analyze the `print` statement:

`print(min(total_costs))`

This statement prints the minimum value in the `total_costs` list.

Based on the precondition, we can conclude that:

* `total_costs` is a list of sums of sublists of `costs` of length `k`.
* Each element in `costs` is the result of applying `func_1` to a row in `rows` with `d` as an argument.
* `rows` is a 2D list of non-negative integers.
* `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers.

Since we don't have the exact values of `rows`, `func_1`, and `d`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **minimum sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list (where costs is a list of results from func_1 applied to each row in rows with d as an argument)**
