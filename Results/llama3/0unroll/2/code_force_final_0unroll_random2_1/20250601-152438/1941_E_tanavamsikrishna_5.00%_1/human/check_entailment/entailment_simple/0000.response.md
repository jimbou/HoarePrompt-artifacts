Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The first function updates the list of depths for a single row, and the second function uses this to calculate the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows.

The first function correctly updates the list of depths by incrementing the first d-1 elements by 1, and then updating the remaining elements to be the sum of the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements (or 0 if i is 0) and the original value of the element plus 1. This is a correct implementation of the dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost for a single row.

The second function correctly calculates the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows by applying the first function to each row, and then calculating the sum of the minimum costs for k consecutive rows. It also correctly handles the edge case where there are not enough rows to build k bridges.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
