Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a row of the river and the maximum distance `d` between supports as input. It calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for that row by iterating through the row and updating the cost at each position based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` positions. The function returns the total cost for the row.

`func_2` reads the input for a test case, which includes the number of rows `n`, the number of columns `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d` between supports. It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`. The function then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It iterates through each row and calculates the minimum cost of installing supports based on the previous `d` positions, which ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports does not exceed `d`. The program also correctly calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

Therefore, the provided Python program is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
