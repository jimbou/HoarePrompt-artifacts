Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. Function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row. It iterates through the row, adding 1 to each cell's value, and then updates the values based on the minimum cost of the previous cells, considering the maximum distance `d` between supports.

2. Function `func_2` correctly reads the input, calculates the costs for each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the total costs for each possible set of k consecutive rows. It finally prints the minimum total cost.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including:

* When k is 1, it correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row.
* When d is 1, it correctly calculates the minimum cost for a row with no gaps between supports.
* When the input rows have varying lengths, it correctly handles the different lengths.

The program also correctly handles the example inputs provided, producing the expected outputs.

Overall, based on the provided problem description and example inputs, the program appears to be correct and handles all potential cases correctly.
