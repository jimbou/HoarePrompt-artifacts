Reasoning: 

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d` as input. It modifies the list by incrementing the first `d-1` elements by 1 and updating the remaining elements to be the sum of the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements (or 0 if the element is the first) and the original value of the element plus 1. The function then returns the last element of the modified list.

`func_2` takes no arguments and reads input from the standard input. It reads four positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells. The function applies `func_1` to each row in the input 2D list `rows` with `d` as an argument and stores the results in the list `costs`. It then calculates the sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list and stores the results in the list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum sum in the `total_costs` list.

The program correctly implements the problem description, which is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river, given the depths of the river cells and the maximum distance between supports.

Correctness: **True**
