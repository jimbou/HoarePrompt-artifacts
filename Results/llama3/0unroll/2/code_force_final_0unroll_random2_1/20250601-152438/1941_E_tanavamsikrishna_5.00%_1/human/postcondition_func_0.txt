This function modifies a list of non-negative integers by incrementing the first d-1 elements by 1 and updating the remaining elements to be the sum of the minimum value of the previous d+1 elements (or 0 if the element is the first) and the original value of the element plus 1. The function then returns the last element of the modified list.
