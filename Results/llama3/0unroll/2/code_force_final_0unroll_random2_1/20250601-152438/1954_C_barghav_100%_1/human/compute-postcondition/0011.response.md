Functionality: **This function reads two pairs of integers from standard input, compares and swaps them if necessary, and then prints the first pair of integers followed by the second pair of integers. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the standard input by consuming the first pair of integers. The function's purpose is to output the two pairs of integers in a specific order, with the first pair being the one that is lexicographically smaller or equal to the second pair.**
