Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program takes into account the promotion where the first k buns are sold at a modified price, and the remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over each test case using a for loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the input values n, a, and b, which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.
3. The program calculates the value of k, which is the minimum of n and b - a. This is because k cannot be greater than n (the number of buns) or b - a (the difference between the modified price and the usual price).
4. If b is less than or equal to a, it means that the modified price is not beneficial, and Bob should sell all buns at the usual price. In this case, the program prints the total profit as a * n.
5. If b is greater than a, the program calculates the total profit using the formula: b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a. This formula takes into account the profit from selling the first k buns at the modified price and the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price.

The formula used in the program is correct and accurately represents the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The program also handles the edge case where b is less than or equal to a, and it correctly calculates the total profit in this scenario.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the given program, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
