Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers n, a, and b.

2. The program calculates the optimal value of k, which is the minimum of n and b - a. This is correct because k cannot be greater than n (the number of buns) or b - a (the difference between the modified price and the usual price).

3. If b is less than or equal to a, the program prints the product of a and n, which is the maximum profit that can be obtained by selling all buns at the usual price. This is correct because in this case, the modified price is not beneficial.

4. If b is greater than a, the program calculates the maximum profit using the formula b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a. This formula is correct because it calculates the profit from selling the first k buns at the modified price and the remaining n - k buns at the usual price.

5. The formula b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 calculates the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns. This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of -1, and the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula n * (a1 + an) / 2, where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. In this case, the first term is b, the last term is b - k + 1, and the number of terms is k. Therefore, the sum is k * (b + b - k + 1) / 2, which simplifies to b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2.

6. The program prints the calculated maximum profit for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
