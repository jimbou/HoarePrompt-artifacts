Functionality: **Calculates and prints the maximum sum of products for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b. For each test case, it determines the minimum of n and b-a, and then calculates the sum of products based on this minimum value and the values of a and b. If b is less than or equal to a, it simply prints the product of a and n. Otherwise, it prints the calculated sum of products.**
