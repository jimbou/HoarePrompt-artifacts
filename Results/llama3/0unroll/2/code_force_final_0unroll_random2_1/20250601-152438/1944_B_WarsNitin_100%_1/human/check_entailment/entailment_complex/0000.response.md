Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by rearranging the elements in the input lists to maximize the number of pairs of equal elements, with the constraint that the total number of pairs across both lists does not exceed 2k.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It correctly sorts the input lists `b` and `c` to facilitate the pairing process.
3. The program correctly identifies the pairs of equal elements in the sorted lists and adds them to the output lists `ans1` and `ans2`.
4. It correctly handles the case where the first or last element of the sorted list is not part of a pair, by adding it to the output list `l`.
5. The program correctly iterates through the sorted lists to find the remaining pairs of equal elements and adds them to the output lists.
6. It correctly prints the output lists for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
