Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The rest of the input remains unchanged, with each test case still containing two lines: the first line with two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line with `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n`. The constraints on `n`, `k`, and the integers `a_i` are still valid.
