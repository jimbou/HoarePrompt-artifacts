Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

n = 4, k = 2
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]

In this case, the program will output:

1 1 2 2
3 3 4 4

However, the correct output should be:

1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4

The program fails to handle the case where all elements in the first half of the array are distinct, and all elements in the second half of the array are also distinct. In this case, the program should output the first half of the array as the left subset and the second half of the array as the right subset, but instead, it outputs a different subset.

The issue lies in the way the program constructs the left and right subsets. The program tries to find pairs of equal elements in the first half of the array and adds them to the left subset, but it does not consider the case where all elements are distinct. Similarly, it tries to find pairs of equal elements in the second half of the array and adds them to the right subset, but it does not consider the case where all elements are distinct.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle the case where all elements in the first half of the array are distinct, and all elements in the second half of the array are also distinct. One possible solution is to add a check at the beginning of the program to see if all elements in the first half of the array are distinct, and if so, output the first half of the array as the left subset and the second half of the array as the right subset.
