Output State: **The output state will be a series of pairs of lists, where each pair represents the output for a test case. Each list contains the rearranged elements from the input lists a and b, with the goal of maximizing the number of pairs of equal elements. The first list in each pair contains the rearranged elements from the first half of the input list, and the second list contains the rearranged elements from the second half of the input list. The number of pairs of equal elements in each list is maximized, with the constraint that the total number of pairs across both lists does not exceed 2k.**
