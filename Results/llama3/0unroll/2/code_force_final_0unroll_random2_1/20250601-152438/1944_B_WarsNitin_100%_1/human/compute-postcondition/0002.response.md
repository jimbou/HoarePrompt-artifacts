Functionality: **This function takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function rearranges the integers in each test case to maximize the number of pairs of equal elements, with the constraint that the total number of pairs across both lists does not exceed 2k. It then prints the rearranged lists for each test case, with the first list containing the rearranged elements from the first half of the input list and the second list containing the rearranged elements from the second half of the input list.**
