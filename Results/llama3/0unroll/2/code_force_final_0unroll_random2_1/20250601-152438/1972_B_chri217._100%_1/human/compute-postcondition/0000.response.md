Output State: **`case` is a list of two elements, the first element is an integer and the second element is a string of length equal to the first element, containing only 'U' and 'D' characters, `ups` is an integer equal to the number of 'U' characters in the second element of `case`.**

In this output state, the value of `case` remains unchanged, but a new variable `ups` is introduced, which is equal to the number of 'U' characters in the second element of `case`. The length of the second element of `case` is still equal to the first element of `case`, and it only contains 'U' and 'D' characters.
