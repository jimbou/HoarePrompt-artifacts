#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input: the first line contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100), and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D".
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, cases is a list of t-1 tuples, where each tuple contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D".
    return cases
    #The program returns a list of t-1 tuples, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. Each tuple in the list contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D".

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from stdin, expecting a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". Returns a list of t test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing the integer n and the string s.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list of two elements, the first element is an integer and the second element is a string of length equal to the first element, containing only 'U' and 'D' characters.
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the second element of `case` is odd, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether the number of 'U' characters in a given string is odd or even, returning 'YES' for odd counts and 'NO' for even counts.
