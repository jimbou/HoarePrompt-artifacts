Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win the game if they both play optimally. The game involves flipping coins and removing them based on certain rules. The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing the number of coins and a string representing the initial state of the coins.

Function 1, `func_1`, reads the input and stores it in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins and the initial state of the coins.

Function 2, `func_2`, takes a single test case as input and calculates the number of 'U's (up-facing coins) in the initial state. If the number of 'U's is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating that Alice will win the game. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that Bob will win the game.

The reasoning behind this solution is based on the observation that if there are an odd number of 'U's, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of 'U's. Since Bob cannot make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of 'U's, Alice will eventually win the game. On the other hand, if there are an even number of 'U's, Bob can always make a move that will leave Alice with an even number of 'U's, and Alice will eventually lose the game.

Correctness: **True**
