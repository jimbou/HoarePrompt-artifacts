stdin contains multiple lines of input: the first line contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 100), followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 <= n <= 100), and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of "U" and "D".
