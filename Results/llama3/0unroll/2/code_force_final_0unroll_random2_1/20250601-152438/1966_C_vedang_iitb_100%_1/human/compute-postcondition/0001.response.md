Output State: The loop will execute 't' number of times, where 't' is an integer between 1 and 10^4. In each iteration, it will read an integer 'n' and a list of 'n' integers from the standard input, sort the list, and then determine the smallest positive integer 'mexsize' that is not in the list. If 'mexsize' is greater than the maximum value in the list, it will print 'Alice' if 'mexsize' is even, and 'Bob' if 'mexsize' is odd. Otherwise, it will print 'Alice' if 'mexsize' is odd, and 'Bob' if 'mexsize' is even. The output will be 't' number of lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
