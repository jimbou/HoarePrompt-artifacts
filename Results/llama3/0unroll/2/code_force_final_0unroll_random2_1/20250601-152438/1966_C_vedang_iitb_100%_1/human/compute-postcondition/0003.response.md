Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game for each test case in the input, where the game involves finding the smallest positive integer (mexsize) not present in a sorted list of integers (a). If mexsize is greater than the maximum value in the list (maxsize), the winner is determined by whether mexsize is even or odd. Otherwise, the winner is determined by whether mexsize is odd or even. The function prints the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') for each test case.**
