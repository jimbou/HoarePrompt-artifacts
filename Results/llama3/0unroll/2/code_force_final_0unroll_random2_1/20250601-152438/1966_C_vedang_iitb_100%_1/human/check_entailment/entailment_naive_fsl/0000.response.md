Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the `mexsize` variable. The `mexsize` is supposed to be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array `a`. However, the program increments `mexsize` only when it finds an element in `a` that is equal to `mexsize`. This means that if there are gaps in the array `a`, the program will not correctly calculate `mexsize`.

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `a = [1, 3, 4]`. The program will calculate `mexsize` as 2, because it finds the element 1 in `a` and increments `mexsize` to 2. However, the correct `mexsize` is 2, because 2 is the smallest positive integer that is not present in `a`. The program will then print 'Bob', which is incorrect. The correct output should be 'Alice', because Alice can win the game by choosing `k = 2` on her first turn.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
