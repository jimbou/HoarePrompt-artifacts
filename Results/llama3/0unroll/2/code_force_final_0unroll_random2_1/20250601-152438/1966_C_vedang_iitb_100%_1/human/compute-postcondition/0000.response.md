The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Since the code only reads the first integer from the input, the remaining inputs are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer**
