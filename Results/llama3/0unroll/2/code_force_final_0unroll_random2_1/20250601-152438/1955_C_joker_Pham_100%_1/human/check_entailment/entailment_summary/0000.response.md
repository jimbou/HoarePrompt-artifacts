Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program uses a two-pointer approach, with `l` and `r` representing the left and right ends of the list of ships, respectively. It iteratively subtracts the smaller of the two end ships' durability from the larger one, until `k` operations are exhausted or no more ships can be sunk. The program correctly handles the cases where the left and right ships have the same durability, and where the number of operations `k` is odd or even.

The program also correctly updates the `sunks` variable to keep track of the number of ships that have been sunk. The use of the `continue` statement is also correct, as it allows the program to skip to the next iteration of the loop when certain conditions are met.

The function `func_1` is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear variable names and concise comments. The input and output formats are also correct, as specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given Python program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
