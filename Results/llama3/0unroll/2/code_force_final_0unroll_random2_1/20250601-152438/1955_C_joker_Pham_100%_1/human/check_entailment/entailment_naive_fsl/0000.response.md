Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken's attack. It handles the cases where the Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately, and it also considers the scenario where the durability of a ship becomes zero and it sinks.

The program uses a while loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks, and it keeps track of the number of ships sunk. It also handles the edge cases where the number of attacks is zero or where the durability of a ship is already zero.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program seems to correctly handle all possible scenarios, and it returns the correct number of ships sunk in each case.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
