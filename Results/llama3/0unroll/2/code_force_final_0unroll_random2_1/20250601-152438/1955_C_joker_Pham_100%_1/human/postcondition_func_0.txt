The function takes a list of positive integers 'a' and two positive integers 'n' and 'k' as input, and returns the number of elements in 'a' that can be "sunk" by repeatedly subtracting the smaller of the first or last element in the list from the larger one, until 'k' operations are exhausted or no more elements can be sunk. The function modifies the input list 'a' in the process.
