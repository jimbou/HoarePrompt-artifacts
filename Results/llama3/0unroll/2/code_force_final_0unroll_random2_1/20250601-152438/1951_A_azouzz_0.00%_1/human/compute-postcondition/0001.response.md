Output State: **The loop will execute 't' number of times, and for each iteration, it will print either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions in the loop body. The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, one for each test case. The value of 't' will remain unchanged, and the stdin will be empty after all test cases have been processed.**
