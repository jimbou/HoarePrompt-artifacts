Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string `s` contains a single '1' and `n` is greater than 1. In this case, the program should print 'NO' because it is not possible to turn on a single lamp using the given operation. However, the program prints 'YES' in this case.

For example, if the input is:

```
1
3
100
```

The program prints 'YES', but the correct output should be 'NO'.
