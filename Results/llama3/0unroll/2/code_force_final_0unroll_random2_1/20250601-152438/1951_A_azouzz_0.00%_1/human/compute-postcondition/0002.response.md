Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a binary string. It then analyzes the binary string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console based on the following conditions: if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and odd, or if the count is 1, it prints 'NO'; if the string contains '11', it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results, leaving the standard input empty.**
