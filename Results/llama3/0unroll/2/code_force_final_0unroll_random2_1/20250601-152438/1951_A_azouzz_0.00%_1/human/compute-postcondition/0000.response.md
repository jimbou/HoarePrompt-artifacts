The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), which is assigned to the variable `t`. The second line contains a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= n <= 50), which is not assigned to any variable yet.

Since the first line of each test case is consumed by the input statement, the stdin now contains multiple test cases, each consisting of one line (the binary string `s`).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of one line: a binary string `s` of size `n` (1 <= n <= 50).**
