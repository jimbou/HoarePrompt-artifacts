Functionality: **The function generates a series of lists of integers based on input parameters 'n' and 'k'. For each input pair, it creates a list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, removes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 'k', and appends 'k', 'k+1', and 'k+2^idx+1' to the list, where 'idx' is the index of the removed power of 2. The function then prints the length of the modified list followed by its elements. The number of output lines is equal to the initial input 't', which specifies the number of input pairs.**
