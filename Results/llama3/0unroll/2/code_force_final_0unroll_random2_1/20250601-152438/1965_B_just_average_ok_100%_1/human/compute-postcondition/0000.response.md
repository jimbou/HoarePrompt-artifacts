Output State: **The output state will be a series of lines, where each line contains the length of the list 'nums' followed by the elements of 'nums' after the operations have been performed. The number of lines will be equal to the value of 't' in the initial state. The 'nums' list will contain powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, with the exception of 2^idx, where idx is the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 'k'. Additionally, the list will contain 'k', 'k+1', and 'k+2^idx+1'.**
