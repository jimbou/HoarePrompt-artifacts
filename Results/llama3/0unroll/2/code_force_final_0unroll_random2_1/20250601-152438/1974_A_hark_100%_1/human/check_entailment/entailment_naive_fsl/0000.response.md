Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when x = 13 and y = 1, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be 2. This is because 13 1x1 icons and 1 2x2 icon cannot fit on one screen.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed when there are both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The program tries to calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons first, and then calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, this approach does not work when the number of 1x1 icons is large enough to require an additional screen, even if the 2x2 icons can fit on one screen.

A correct solution would need to take into account the total number of cells required by both the 1x1 and 2x2 icons, and then calculate the minimum number of screens needed to accommodate all the icons.
