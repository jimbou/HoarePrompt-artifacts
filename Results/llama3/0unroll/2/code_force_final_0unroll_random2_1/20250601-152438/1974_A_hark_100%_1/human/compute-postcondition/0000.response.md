Output State: **`ap` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 99, stdin contains two space-separated integers for each of the remaining `ap` test cases: the number of applications with a 1x1 icon and the number of applications with a 2x2 icon, respectively, both integers are non-negative and less than or equal to 99.**

In this output state, the variable `ap` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 99. The stdin now contains two space-separated integers for each of the remaining `ap` test cases, representing the number of applications with a 1x1 icon and the number of applications with a 2x2 icon, respectively. Both integers are non-negative and less than or equal to 99.
