Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the total number of boxes required for each test case. It accepts two inputs: the number of test cases and, for each test case, two space-separated integers representing the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The function calculates the total number of boxes required based on these inputs and prints the result for each test case.**
