Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, and in each iteration, it will read `n` and `k` from the standard input, and then read `n-1` pairs of integers `a` and `b` from the standard input. The loop will then perform a binary search to find the minimum value `L` such that the number of cuts `numCuts` is greater than `k` or the number of cuts is equal to `k` and the leftover value is greater than or equal to `L`. The loop will print the value of `L` at the end of each iteration. The state of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` will be updated after each iteration, but the state of the other variables in the precondition will remain unchanged.
