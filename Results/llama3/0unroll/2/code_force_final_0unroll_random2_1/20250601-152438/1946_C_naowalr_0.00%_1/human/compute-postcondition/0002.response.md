Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of cuts required to divide a graph into connected components such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to k, or the number of cuts is equal to k and the size of the largest connected component is greater than or equal to x. The number of integers in the output state is equal to the value of t.
