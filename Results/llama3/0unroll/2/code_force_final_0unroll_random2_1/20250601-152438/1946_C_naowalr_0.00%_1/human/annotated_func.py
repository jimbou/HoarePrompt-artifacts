#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k < n, and the next n-1 lines of stdin contain two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= n.

        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of cuts required to divide a graph into connected components such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to k, or the number of cuts is equal to k and the size of the largest connected component is greater than or equal to x. The number of integers in the output state is equal to the value of t.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The input is expected to be in a specific format, with the first line containing a positive integer t, followed by t sets of input data. Each set consists of two positive integers n and k, where k is less than n, followed by n-1 lines of two integers a and b, representing edges in a graph. The function processes each set of input data, performing a binary search to find the minimum number of cuts required to divide the graph into connected components such that the number of cuts is greater than or equal to k, or the number of cuts is equal to k and the size of the largest connected component is greater than or equal to a certain value x. The function prints the result of this binary search for each set of input data, resulting in a series of integers as output.
