The code reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer, the new value of `t` will also be a positive integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` < `n`, and the next `n-2` lines of stdin contain two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`.**
