Output State: **t is 0, and the standard output contains multiple lines. Each line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 1000), where a_i = 1000 - (x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_i).**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable t has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The standard output contains multiple lines, each representing the result of a test case. Each line contains n space-separated integers, where each integer a_i is calculated as 1000 minus the sum of the first i-1 integers in the input line.
