Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). The second line contains n-1 space-separated integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is larger than 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500), and the second line contains n-1 space-separated integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500).
