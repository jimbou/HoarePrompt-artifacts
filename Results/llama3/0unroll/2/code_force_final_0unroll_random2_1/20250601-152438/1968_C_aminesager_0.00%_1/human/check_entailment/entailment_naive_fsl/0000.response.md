Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array contains a 1. In this case, the program will try to append a negative number to the array `a`, which is not allowed according to the problem description. The problem description states that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

For example, if the input is `3` and the array is `[1, 1]`, the program will try to append `-1` to the array `a`, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
