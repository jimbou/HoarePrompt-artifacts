Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of integers, and for each test case, it calculates and prints a sequence of integers to standard output. The sequence is calculated by starting with 1000 and subtracting each input integer from the previous value, and the resulting sequence is printed in reverse order.**
