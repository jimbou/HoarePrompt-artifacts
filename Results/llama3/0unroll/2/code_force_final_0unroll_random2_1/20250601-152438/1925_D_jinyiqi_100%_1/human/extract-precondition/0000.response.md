Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains multiple lines. The first line contains three integers: n, m, and k. The next m lines contain three integers each: a_i, b_i, and f_i. The input is well-formed, and the constraints on the input values are met: 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.**
