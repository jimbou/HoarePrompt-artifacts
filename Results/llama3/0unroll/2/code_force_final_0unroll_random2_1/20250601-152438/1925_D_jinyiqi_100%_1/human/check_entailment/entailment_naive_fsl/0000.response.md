Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input values of n, m, and k are large. The program uses the formula p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) to calculate the numerator of the expected value, but this formula can cause an overflow when the values of n, m, and k are large. This is because the product of k, cn2, and sum_f can exceed the maximum limit of an integer in Python.

For example, if n = 10^5, m = 10^5, and k = 2 * 10^5, the value of p will be 2 * 2 * 10^5 * 10^5 * 10^9 + 10^5 * 2 * 10^5 * (2 * 10^5 - 1), which is much larger than the maximum limit of an integer in Python. This will cause an overflow error and the program will not produce the correct result.

To fix this issue, the program should use a data type that can handle large integers, such as the arbitrary-precision arithmetic provided by the `decimal` module in Python. Alternatively, the program can use a different approach to calculate the expected value that avoids the overflow issue.
