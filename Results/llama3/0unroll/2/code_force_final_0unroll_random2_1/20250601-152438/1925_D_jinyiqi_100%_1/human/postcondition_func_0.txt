Calculates and prints the modular inverse of a fraction for each of t test cases, where the fraction is derived from the input values n, m, k, and the sum of f values, and the modulus is 10^9 + 7. The function reads input from stdin, processes it, and outputs the results, leaving the input stream empty after execution.
