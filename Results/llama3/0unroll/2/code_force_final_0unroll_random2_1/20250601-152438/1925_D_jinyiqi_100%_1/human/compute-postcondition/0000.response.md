Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, M is 1000000007, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The second line assigns the value of `10 ** 9 + 7` to `M`, which is a constant used for modular arithmetic. The value of `M` is now fixed at `1000000007`. The state of `stdin` is updated as one test case has been read, so it now contains multiple test cases minus one.
