Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program reads the correct number of test cases and integers for each test case.
2. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to pair up the smallest numbers and maximize the score.
3. The program correctly pairs up the integers, calculates the minimum value in each pair, and adds it to the total score.
4. The program prints the maximum final score that can be achieved for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case correctly and printing the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
