This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. For each test case, it sorts the integers in ascending order, pairs them up, and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair. The function then prints this sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the input list is empty, and the function has printed the sum of the minimum pairs for each test case.
