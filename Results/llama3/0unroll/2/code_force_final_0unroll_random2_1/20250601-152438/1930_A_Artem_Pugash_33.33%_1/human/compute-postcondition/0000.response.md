The code `numCases = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `numCases`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) followed by t test cases. The first integer t is assigned to `numCases`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`numCases` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains `numCases` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).**
