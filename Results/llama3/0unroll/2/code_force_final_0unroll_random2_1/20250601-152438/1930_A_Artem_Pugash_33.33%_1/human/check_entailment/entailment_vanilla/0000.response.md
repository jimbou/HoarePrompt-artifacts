Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves, where each move involves choosing two integers x and y from the whiteboard, adding min(x, y) to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

2. The given program first reads the number of test cases (numCases) and then iterates over each test case.

3. For each test case, it reads the number of integers (numInteger) and the list of integers (numbers) from the input.

4. The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order using the sort() function with reverse=False.

5. It then initializes a variable suma to 0, which will store the maximum final score.

6. The program enters a while loop that continues until the list of numbers is empty.

7. Inside the loop, it pops the first two elements from the sorted list (a and b), converts them to integers, and adds the minimum of a and b to the suma.

8. After the loop finishes, it prints the maximum final score (suma) for the current test case.

9. The program repeats steps 3-8 for each test case.

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score by sorting the integers and then pairing the smallest integers together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

Correctness: **True**
