Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the n moves. It sorts the numbers in ascending order and then iteratively selects the smallest two numbers, adds the smaller one to the score, and removes them from the list. This process is repeated n times, and the final score is printed.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* It correctly handles the case when there is only one move (n=1), as it simply selects the smallest two numbers and adds the smaller one to the score.
* It correctly handles the case when there are multiple moves (n>1), as it iteratively selects the smallest two numbers and adds the smaller one to the score, ensuring that the maximum final score is achieved.
* It correctly handles the case when all numbers are the same, as it simply adds the same number to the score n times.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
