#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: The loop will execute for a number of iterations equal to the value of `num`. In each iteration, it will read an integer `num2` and a string of space-separated integers `case` from standard input. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it will print 1 and 16668, and then exit the loop. Otherwise, it will calculate the median of the integers in `case`, increment the median until it is greater than the original median, and print the number of increments. The final state will be the same as the initial state, with the only changes being the values of `num2`, `case`, and the output printed to the console.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and n integers. If n is greater than 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the median of the integers, increments the median until it is greater than the original median, and prints the number of increments. The function repeats this process for a number of iterations equal to the initial input value.
