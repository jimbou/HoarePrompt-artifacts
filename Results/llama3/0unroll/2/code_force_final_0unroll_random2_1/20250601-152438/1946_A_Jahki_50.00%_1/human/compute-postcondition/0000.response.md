The code `num = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `num`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), the first input is accepted and assigned to `num`. The remaining inputs in the test case are still in stdin.

Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) where n is the value of `num`.**
