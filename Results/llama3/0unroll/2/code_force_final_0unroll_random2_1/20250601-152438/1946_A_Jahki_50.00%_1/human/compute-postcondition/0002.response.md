Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and n integers. If n is greater than 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 and exits. Otherwise, it calculates the median of the integers, increments the median until it is greater than the original median, and prints the number of increments. The function repeats this process for a number of iterations equal to the initial input value.**
