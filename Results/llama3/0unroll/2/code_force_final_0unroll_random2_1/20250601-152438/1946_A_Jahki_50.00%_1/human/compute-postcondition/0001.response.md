Output State: **The loop will execute for a number of iterations equal to the value of `num`. In each iteration, it will read an integer `num2` and a string of space-separated integers `case` from standard input. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it will print 1 and 16668, and then exit the loop. Otherwise, it will calculate the median of the integers in `case`, increment the median until it is greater than the original median, and print the number of increments. The final state will be the same as the initial state, with the only changes being the values of `num2`, `case`, and the output printed to the console.**
