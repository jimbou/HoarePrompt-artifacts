Reasoning:  
The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the range [1, n] and the index of the maximum value in the range [1, n] using the given query format. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value and its index, which is efficient and correct. The program also correctly handles the input and output operations, including flushing the output buffer after each query and result.

Correctness: **True**
