Output State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (the number of test cases), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin**.

The first line defines a function `I` that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, split by spaces. The second line defines a function `R` that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin. Neither of these lines modify the state of stdin or any other variables. The state of stdin remains the same, containing one input: an integer (the number of test cases). The functions `I` and `R` are now defined and can be used to read input from stdin.
