Functionality: **Determines the index and maximum value of a sequence of integers for multiple test cases and prints the results.**

This function accepts a series of test cases as input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) followed by a sequence of n integers. It then determines the maximum value in the range [1, n] and the index of the maximum value in the range [1, n] for each test case. The function prints the results for each test case in the format '! index max_value'. The state of the other variables, such as stdin, remains unchanged after the function concludes.
