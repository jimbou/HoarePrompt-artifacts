Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The issue lies in the way it calculates the cost. The program increments the cost whenever it encounters a '0' and there is at least one '1' to its left, or whenever it encounters a '1' and there are still '0's to its right. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to sort the string, which is to find the longest contiguous block of '0's and '1's and then perform a cyclic shift on the remaining part of the string.

For example, consider the input string "101011". The program will output 5, but the correct answer is 3. The optimal way to sort this string is to perform a cyclic shift on the substring "101", resulting in "011", and then perform another cyclic shift on the remaining part of the string, resulting in "0011". This requires a total cost of 3, not 5.
