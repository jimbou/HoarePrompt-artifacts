Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
3. It initializes variables to keep track of the number of zeroes, the count of 0s and 1s, and the answer.
4. The program then iterates over the binary string `s`. For each character `c`, it increments the count of `c` and updates the answer based on the following logic:
	* If `c` is 0, it increments the answer by 1 if there are any 1s to the left of the current position (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`). This is because a 0 can be moved to the left of a 1 by a cyclic shift operation.
	* If `c` is 1, it increments the answer by the number of zeroes to the right of the current position (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`). This is because a 1 can be moved to the right of a 0 by a cyclic shift operation.
5. Finally, the program prints the answer for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it considers all possible cyclic shift operations that can be performed on the binary string to make it sorted in non-descending order. The answer is calculated by summing up the minimum number of operations required to move each character to its correct position.

Correctness: **True**
