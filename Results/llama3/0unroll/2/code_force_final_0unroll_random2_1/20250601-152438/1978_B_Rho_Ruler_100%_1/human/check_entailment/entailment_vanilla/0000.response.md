Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k, which is the number of buns sold at a modified price.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The `func_1` function calculates the profit for a given value of k. It correctly calculates the profit by considering the modified price for the first k buns and the usual price for the remaining (n - k) buns.

2. The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k. It initializes the search range to [0, min(n, b)] and iteratively updates the search range based on the comparison of the profits at the mid and next points.

3. The program correctly updates the maximum profit by comparing the profit at the mid point with the current maximum profit.

4. The program correctly terminates the binary search when the search range is empty (i.e., when low > high).

5. The program returns the maximum profit found during the binary search.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the binary search approach to find the optimal value of k and calculates the maximum profit accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
