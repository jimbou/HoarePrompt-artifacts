Output State: **low is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n such that func_1(low, n, a, b) is the maximum value of func_1(mid, n, a, b) for all mid in the range [0, min(n, b)], high is low - 1, max_profit is the maximum value of func_1(mid, n, a, b) for all mid in the range [0, min(n, b)], n is unchanged, a is unchanged, b is unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable "low" will be set to the smallest integer greater than or equal to n such that the value of func_1(low, n, a, b) is the maximum value of func_1(mid, n, a, b) for all mid in the range [0, min(n, b)]. The variable "high" will be set to low - 1. The variable "max_profit" will be set to the maximum value of func_1(mid, n, a, b) for all mid in the range [0, min(n, b)]. The variables "n", "a", and "b" will remain unchanged.
