Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns, considering the promotion where the first k buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price.

Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the profit for a given k, n, a, and b. It correctly calculates the weighted sum of products involving these variables, considering the modified price for the first k buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

Function 2 (`func_2`) uses a binary search approach to find the maximum profit by iterating over the possible values of k (from 0 to the minimum of n and b). It uses Function 1 to calculate the profit for each mid value and updates the maximum profit accordingly. The binary search approach ensures that the function finds the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit.

The main function reads the input, calls Function 2 for each test case, and prints the maximum profit.

Based on the execution summaries, both functions seem to be working correctly. Function 1 correctly calculates the profit for a given k, and Function 2 uses a binary search approach to find the maximum profit.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
