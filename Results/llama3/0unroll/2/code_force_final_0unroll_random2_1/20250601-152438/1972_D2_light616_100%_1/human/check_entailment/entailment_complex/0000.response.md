Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying certain conditions. The given code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the number of coprime pairs (a, b) such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers provided as input, and gcd(a, b) = 1. This function seems to be correct as it iterates over all possible values of x and y, checks if the pair (x, y) is coprime, and if so, increments the count.

However, the problem statement requires that b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b. The given code does not explicitly check for this condition. Instead, it only checks if the pair (x, y) is coprime. 

Upon closer inspection, it can be observed that the code is actually checking for the condition b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b indirectly. The loop iterates over all possible values of x and y such that (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m. This is equivalent to checking if a + b divides b * gcd(a, b), which is the required condition.

`func_2` reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then iterates t times. In each iteration, it calls `func_1`, which calculates and prints the number of coprime pairs (a, b) for the given input.

Since `func_1` correctly calculates the required number of pairs and `func_2` correctly iterates over the test cases, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
