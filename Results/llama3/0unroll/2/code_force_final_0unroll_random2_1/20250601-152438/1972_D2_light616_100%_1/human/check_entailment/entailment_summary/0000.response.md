Reasoning: 

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b.

Function `func_1()` calculates and prints the number of coprime pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, where n and m are positive integers provided as input, and gcd(a, b) = 1. This function seems to be related to the problem, but it only considers coprime pairs, which is a specific case of the problem.

Function `func_2()` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`. This function is the main entry point of the program.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that `func_1()` is actually calculating the correct result for the problem. The key insight is that the condition `b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b` is equivalent to `gcd(a, b) = 1` when `a` and `b` are coprime. Therefore, `func_1()` is indeed calculating the correct number of ordered pairs satisfying the problem conditions.

Since `func_2()` correctly iterates over the test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case, and `func_1()` correctly calculates the result for each test case, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
