Reasoning:

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case, and `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

In `func_1`, the program iterates over all possible values of x and y such that (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m. For each pair (x, y), it checks if gcd(x, y) == 1. If so, it increments the count by the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y). This is because for each coprime pair (x, y), there are min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) pairs (a, b) such that a = k * (x + y) * x and b = k * (x + y) * y, where k is a positive integer.

The program correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for each test case and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
