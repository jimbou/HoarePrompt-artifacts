Reasoning:

The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b

The provided Python program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case, and `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1.  `func_1` initializes variables `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0. It then reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
2.  The program uses a while loop to iterate over possible values of `x` such that `x * x <= n`. This is done to ensure that `x` is not too large, as the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `n` and `m` does not exceed 2 * 10^6.
3.  Inside the loop, another while loop iterates over possible values of `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. This is done to ensure that the pair `(a, b)` satisfies the first condition.
4.  If `math.gcd(x, y)` is equal to 1, the program increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. This is done to count the number of pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the second condition.
5.  After the inner loop, `x` is incremented by 1.
6.  Once the outer loop finishes, the program prints the count `cnt`.
7.  `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y`, checks the conditions, and counts the valid pairs.

Correctness: **True**
