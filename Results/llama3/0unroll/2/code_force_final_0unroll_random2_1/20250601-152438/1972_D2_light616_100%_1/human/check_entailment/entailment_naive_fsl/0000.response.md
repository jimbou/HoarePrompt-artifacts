Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.

The program uses a clever approach by iterating over the possible values of x and y, where x and y are the factors of a and b respectively. It uses the fact that b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b if and only if (x + y) * x is a factor of a and (x + y) * y is a factor of b.

The program correctly handles the cases where x and y are coprime (i.e., gcd(x, y) == 1) and calculates the number of valid pairs by summing up the minimum of n // ((x + y) * x) and m // ((x + y) * y) for each pair of x and y.

The program also correctly handles the case where x * x > n, as in this case, there are no more valid pairs.

The program passes all the provided test cases and does not have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
