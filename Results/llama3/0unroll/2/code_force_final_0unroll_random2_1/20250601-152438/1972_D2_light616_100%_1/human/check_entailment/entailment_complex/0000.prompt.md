Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: cnt is the number of coprime pairs (a, b) such that 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and gcd(a, b) = 1.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the number of coprime pairs (a, b) such that 1 <= a <= n, 1 <= b <= m, and gcd(a, b) = 1)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the number of coprime pairs (a, b) such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers provided as input, and gcd(a, b) = 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and after each execution, the function `func_1()` will be called. The state of `t` will be decremented by 1 after each iteration, and the state of the variables inside `func_1()` will be updated accordingly. After the loop finishes, `t` will be 0, and the state of the variables inside `func_1()` will be the state after the last execution of `func_1()`. The state of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. The function does not return any value or modify any external state, but it may have side effects through the execution of `func_1()`. After the loop finishes, the function terminates, leaving the state of the variables inside `func_1()` as they were after the last execution.
