Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and after each execution, the function `func_1()` will be called. The state of `t` will be decremented by 1 after each iteration, and the state of the variables inside `func_1()` will be updated accordingly. After the loop finishes, `t` will be 0, and the state of the variables inside `func_1()` will be the state after the last execution of `func_1()`. The state of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.**
