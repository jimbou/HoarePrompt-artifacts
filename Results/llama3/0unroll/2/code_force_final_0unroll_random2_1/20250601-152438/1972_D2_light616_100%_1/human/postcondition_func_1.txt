The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it calls the function `func_1()`, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. The function does not return any value or modify any external state, but it may have side effects through the execution of `func_1()`. After the loop finishes, the function terminates, leaving the state of the variables inside `func_1()` as they were after the last execution.
