The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6). After the code is executed, the first integer `t` is removed from the stdin, and the remaining input is `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m`. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6)**
