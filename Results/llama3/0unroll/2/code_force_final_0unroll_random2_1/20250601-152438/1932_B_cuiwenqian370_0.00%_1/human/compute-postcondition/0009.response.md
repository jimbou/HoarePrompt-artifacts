Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is not equal to 0, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is `-float('inf')` and the rest are zeros, and the first character of `path` is '*', and from this point on, the first character of `path` is not '@'.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[0]` has been updated to `-float('inf')`, which is a very large negative number, while the rest of the values in `dp` remain zeros. The other variables, `path` and `n`, remain unchanged. The first character of `path` is still '*', and it is still not '@'.
