Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 1 and the second value is 1 if the second character of `path` is '@' otherwise the second value is 1, and the rest are zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-float('inf')` and the second value is `-float('inf')` if the second character of `path` is '@' otherwise the second value is 0, and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except the second value which is 1 if the second character of `path` is '@' otherwise the second value is 0. The second character of `path` is not '*'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The path and the number of characters in the path remain the same. The dynamic programming list `dp` has been updated. If the first character of the path is '@', the first two values of `dp` are 1 if the second character of the path is '@', otherwise the second value is 1. If the first character of the path is '*', the first two values of `dp` are `-float('inf')` if the second character of the path is '@', otherwise the second value is 0. If the first character of the path is neither '@' nor '*', the first value of `dp` is 0 and the second value is 1 if the second character of the path is '@', otherwise the second value is 0. The rest of the values in `dp` remain zeros. The second character of the path is not '*'.
