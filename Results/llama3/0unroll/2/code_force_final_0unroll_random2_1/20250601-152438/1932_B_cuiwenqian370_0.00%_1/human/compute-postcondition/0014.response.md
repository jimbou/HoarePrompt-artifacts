Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. The second character of `path` is '*'. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 1 and the rest are `-float('inf')`. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-float('inf')` and the rest are `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 0 and the rest are `-float('inf')`.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[1]` has been updated to `-float('inf')` regardless of the initial value of `dp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
