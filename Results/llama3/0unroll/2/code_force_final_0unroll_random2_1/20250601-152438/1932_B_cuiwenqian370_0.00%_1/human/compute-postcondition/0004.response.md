Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is not equal to 0, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros**.

In this output state, the code has created a new list `dp` with `n` elements, where `n` is the number of characters in the `path` list. Each element in the `dp` list is initialized to 0. The values of `path` and `n` remain unchanged.
