Postcondition: ***`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is not equal to 0, `dp` is a list of `n` values where if the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-float('inf')` and the rest are zeros, otherwise `dp` is a list of `n` zeros, and the first character of `path` is not '@'.***
