Output State: **`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is not equal to 0, `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 1 and the rest are zeros. The first character of `path` is '@'.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[0]` has been updated to 1, indicating that there is one way to reach the first character '@' in the `path`. The rest of the values in `dp` remain zeros, as they have not been updated. The values of `path` and `n` remain unchanged, and the first character of `path` is still '@'.
