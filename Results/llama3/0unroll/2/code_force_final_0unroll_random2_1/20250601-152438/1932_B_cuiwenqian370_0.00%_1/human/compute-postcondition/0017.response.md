Postcondition: ***`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. If the second character of `path` is '*', then if the first character of `path` is '@', `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 1 and the rest are `-float('inf')`. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-float('inf')` and the rest are `-float('inf')`. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 0 and the rest are `-float('inf')`. If the second character of `path` is not '*', then if the first character of `path` is '@', `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 1 and the second value is 1 if the second character of `path` is '@' otherwise the second value is 1, and the rest are zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-float('inf')` and the second value is `-float('inf')` if the second character of `path` is '@' otherwise the second value is 0, and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros except the second value which is 1 if the second character of `path` is '@' otherwise the second value is 0.***
