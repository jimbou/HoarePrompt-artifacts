Postcondition: ***`path` is a list of characters, where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the number of characters in `path`, `n` is not equal to 0. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 1 and the rest are zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-float('inf')` and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.***
