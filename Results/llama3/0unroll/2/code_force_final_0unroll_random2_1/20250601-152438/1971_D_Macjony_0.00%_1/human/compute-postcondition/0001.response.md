Output State: **The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the number of alternating sequences of 0s and 1s in the corresponding input string, with a correction applied if a sequence starts with 0 and ends with 1. The number of output integers will be equal to the value of `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.**
