Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the string contains both "map" and "pie" substrings, and the "map" substring is followed by the "pie" substring. In this case, the program will remove the "map" substring first, and then it will not be able to remove the "pie" substring because it has already been modified.

For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will return 1, but the correct answer is 2. This is because the program only removes the "map" substring and not the "pie" substring.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to use a different approach, such as using regular expressions to find all occurrences of "map" and "pie" substrings in the string, and then removing them.
