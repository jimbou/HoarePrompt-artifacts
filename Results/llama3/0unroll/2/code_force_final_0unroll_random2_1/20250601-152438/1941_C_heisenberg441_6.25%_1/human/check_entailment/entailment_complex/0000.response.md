Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns an integer. If the input string is 'mapie', it returns 1. Otherwise, it removes all non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the string and returns the count of removed 'pie' occurrences.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The program only returns the count of removed 'pie' occurrences, but it does not consider the case where the string contains both 'map' and 'pie' substrings. In such cases, removing 'map' substrings may also remove some 'pie' substrings, which would lead to an incorrect count.

For example, consider the input string "mapie". The program would remove the 'map' substring and then remove the remaining 'ie' substring, resulting in a count of 1. However, the correct count should be 2, as both 'map' and 'pie' substrings need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
