Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly identifies the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program first checks if the string is 'mapie' and returns 1 if it is. Otherwise, it removes all non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from the string and returns the count of removed 'pie' occurrences.

The program correctly handles the cases where the string contains multiple occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', and it also correctly handles the case where the string does not contain any occurrences of 'map' or 'pie'.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, returning the correct count of removed 'pie' occurrences.

Correctness: **True**
