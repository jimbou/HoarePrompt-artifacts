Reasoning: The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a given string to make it beautiful. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

The function first checks if the input string `s` is equal to 'mapie'. If it is, the function returns 1, indicating that one character needs to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

If the input string `s` is not equal to 'mapie', the function initializes a variable `ans` to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as the string `s` contains the substring 'map'. Inside the loop, the function removes the first occurrence of 'map' from the string `s` and increments the variable `ans` by 1. This process is repeated until the string `s` no longer contains the substring 'map'.

After the first while loop, the function enters another while loop that continues as long as the string `s` contains the substring 'pie'. Inside this loop, the function removes the first occurrence of 'pie' from the string `s` and increments the variable `ans` by 1. This process is repeated until the string `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie'.

Finally, the function returns the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from the original string `s` to make it beautiful.

The program then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself, and then calls the function `func_1` with the string `s` as input. The function returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted, which is then printed as the output.

Correctness: **True**
