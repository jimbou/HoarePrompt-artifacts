Reasoning:

The program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
4. It calculates the index `p` of the median element using the formula `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This is correct because the median of an array of length `n` is the element at index `⌈n/2⌉ - 1` (0-indexed).
5. It counts the occurrences of the median element `a[p]` in the sorted array using the `count` method.
6. It prints the count of median elements on a new line for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. By counting the occurrences of the median element, it effectively finds the number of elements that need to be increased to make the median greater than its current value.

Correctness: **True**
