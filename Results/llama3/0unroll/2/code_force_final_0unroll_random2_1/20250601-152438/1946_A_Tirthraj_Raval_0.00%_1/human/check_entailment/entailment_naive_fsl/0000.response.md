Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the median is the smallest number in the array. In this case, the program will count the occurrences of the median, but it will not consider the numbers that are smaller than the median. As a result, the program will output the wrong result.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program will output 5, but the correct answer is 0, because the median is already the largest number in the array.

The correct approach is to count the numbers that are smaller than the median and need to be increased to the median. This can be done by finding the index of the median and then counting the numbers that are smaller than the median and have an index greater than or equal to the median index.

Here is the correct code:

def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        res = sum(1 for i in range(p, n) if a[i] < a[p])
        print(res)
