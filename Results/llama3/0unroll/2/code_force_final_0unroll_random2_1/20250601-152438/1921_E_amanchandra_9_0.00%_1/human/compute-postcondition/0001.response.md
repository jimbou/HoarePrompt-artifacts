Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game for multiple test cases, where each test case involves two players, Alice and Bob, with chips placed on a rectangular board. The function takes no parameters but reads input from stdin, expecting multiple lines of input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains six integers representing the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. The function then analyzes each test case and prints the winner, either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', based on the chip positions and board dimensions. The output is a list of strings, one for each test case, indicating the winner of that test case.**
