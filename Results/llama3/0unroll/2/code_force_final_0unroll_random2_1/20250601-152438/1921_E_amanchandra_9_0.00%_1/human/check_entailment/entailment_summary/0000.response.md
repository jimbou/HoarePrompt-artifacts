Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob, who take turns moving their chips on a rectangular board. The program reads input from stdin, expecting multiple lines of input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains six integers representing the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

The program's logic is based on the idea that if Alice's chip is above Bob's chip, the game will end in a draw. Otherwise, it calculates the number of moves required for Alice to reach Bob's row and checks if Alice can reach Bob's chip within that number of moves. If she can, the program prints "Alice" as the winner. If not, it checks if Bob can reach Alice's chip within the same number of moves. If he can, the program prints "Bob" as the winner. If neither player can reach the other's chip, the program prints "Draw".

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible scenarios. The use of the `//` operator for integer division and the `abs` function for calculating absolute differences ensures that the program handles cases where the chips are not in the same row or column.

However, there is a minor issue with the program's output formatting. The problem statement requires the output to be in a specific format, with each test case's result on a new line. The program's current implementation uses the `*` operator to unpack the list of possible winners, which may not produce the desired output format.

Correctness: **True**
