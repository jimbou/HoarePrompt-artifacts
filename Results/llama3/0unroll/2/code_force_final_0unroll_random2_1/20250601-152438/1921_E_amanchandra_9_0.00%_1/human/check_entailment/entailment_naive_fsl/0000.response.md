Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice's chip is in the last row (i.e., `xa == h`) or Bob's chip is in the first row (i.e., `xb == 1`). In these cases, the game should immediately end in a draw, but the program does not check for these conditions.

For example, if the input is `h = 5, w = 5, xa = 5, ya = 3, xb = 1, yb = 2`, the program will output "Alice" instead of "Draw", which is incorrect.
