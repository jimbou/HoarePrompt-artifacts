Output State: **nodes is an empty dictionary, start is a node in the tree, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True**.

The code block first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t`, respectively. Then, it initializes an empty list `edges` and an empty dictionary `nodes`. The `defaultdict` function is used to create a dictionary where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. However, since the dictionary is initialized empty, it does not contain any nodes or edges. The variable `empty` is set to `True`, indicating that the dictionary is empty. The variable `start` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.
