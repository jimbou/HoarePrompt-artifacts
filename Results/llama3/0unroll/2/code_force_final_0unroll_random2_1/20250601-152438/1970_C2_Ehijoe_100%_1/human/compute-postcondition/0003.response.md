Output State: **nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, start is a node in the tree, n is an integer, t is an integer, edges is an empty list, empty is True, leaves is an empty deque**

In this output state, a new variable `leaves` is introduced and assigned an empty deque. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `leaves` deque is initially empty, waiting to be populated with nodes that are leaves in the tree.
