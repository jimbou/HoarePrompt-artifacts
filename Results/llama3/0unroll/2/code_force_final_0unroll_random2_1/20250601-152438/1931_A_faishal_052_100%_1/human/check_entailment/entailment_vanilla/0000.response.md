Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program works by iterating over each test case, and for each test case, it tries to construct the lexicographically smallest word by subtracting the smallest possible values from the encoded integer.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and stores it in the variable `cases`.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer and stores it in the variable `lex`.
3. The program then tries to construct the lexicographically smallest word by iterating over a loop that runs twice. In each iteration, it checks the value of `lex` and subtracts the smallest possible value from it.
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it subtracts 1 from `lex` and appends 1 to the array `arr`. This is because the smallest possible letter in the alphabet is 'a', which has an index of 1.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it subtracts 26 from `lex` and appends 26 to the array `arr`. This is because the next smallest possible letter in the alphabet is 'z', which has an index of 26.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it subtracts 26 from `lex` and appends 26 to the array `arr`. This is because the largest possible encoded integer is 78, which corresponds to the word 'zzz'.
4. After the loop, the program appends the remaining value of `lex` to the array `arr`.
5. The program then sorts the array `arr` in ascending order.
6. Finally, the program constructs the lexicographically smallest word by iterating over the sorted array `arr` and converting each index to its corresponding letter using the `chr` function. The resulting word is then printed.

Correctness: **True**
