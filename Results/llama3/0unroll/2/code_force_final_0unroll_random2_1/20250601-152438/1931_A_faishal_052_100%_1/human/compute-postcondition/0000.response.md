Output State: **cases is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers (the encoded words)**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input (the number of test cases) to `cases`. Since the number of test cases is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, `cases` becomes a positive integer less than or equal to 100. The second line initializes an empty list `info`. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains only one input: a list of integers (the encoded words).
