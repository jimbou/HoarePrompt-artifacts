Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 48, the program outputs "auz", but the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is actually "aav". The program does not correctly handle cases where the encoded word can be represented as the sum of three letters in different ways.

The issue lies in the way the program constructs the three-letter word. It first tries to subtract 26 from the encoded word as many times as possible, then subtracts 1 from the remaining value, and finally appends the remaining value to the word. This approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

A correct approach would be to try all possible combinations of three letters that sum up to the encoded word and return the lexicographically smallest one.
