Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then for each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of applications with a 1x1 icon and the number of applications with a 2x2 icon, respectively.
2.  It calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, it calculates `t` as the ceiling of `b / 2`, which is the minimum number of screens required to place all the 2x2 icons.
3.  It then calculates the remaining area after using all the 1x1 icons. Since each screen has 15 cells, it calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which is the remaining area after using all the 1x1 icons.
4.  If the remaining area is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons `a`, it means that all the 1x1 icons can be placed on the screens already allocated for the 2x2 icons. Therefore, it keeps the value of `t` as it is.
5.  If the remaining area is less than the number of 1x1 icons `a`, it means that additional screens are required to place the remaining 1x1 icons. It calculates `t2` as `a - t1`, which is the number of additional 1x1 icons that need to be placed. It then calculates the additional screens required as the ceiling of `t2 / 15` and adds it to `t`.
6.  Finally, it prints the total number of screens required `t` for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the application icons, considering both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Correctness: **True**
