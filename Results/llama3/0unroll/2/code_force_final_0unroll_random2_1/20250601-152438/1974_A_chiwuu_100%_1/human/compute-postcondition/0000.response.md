Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 99, stdin contains one input: two space-separated integers (the number of applications with a 1x1 icon and the number of applications with a 2x2 icon, respectively).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 99. The stdin now contains only one input, which is a space-separated list of two integers representing the number of applications with 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
