Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is (99, 0), the program will output 7, but the correct answer should be 7. However, when the input is (98, 1), the program will output 7, but the correct answer should be 7. 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. The program assumes that the remaining space will always be enough to place the 1x1 icons, but this is not always the case. 

For instance, when the input is (98, 1), the program will place the 2x2 icon on the first screen, leaving 11 spaces. However, the program will then try to place the 98 1x1 icons on the remaining screens, but it will not be able to place all of them on the second screen, because there are not enough spaces left. 

Therefore, the program will output 7, but the correct answer should be 7. 

To fix this issue, the program should correctly calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then place the 1x1 icons on the remaining screens. 

Here is the correct code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

This code correctly calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and then places the 1x1 icons on the remaining screens.
