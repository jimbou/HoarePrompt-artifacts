Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines. It reads three integers (n, k, and x) and an array of n integers, sorts the array in descending order, and calculates the maximum sum of the array elements after removing k elements. The sum is calculated by subtracting twice the sum of the x largest elements from the total sum, and then iteratively adding the next largest element and subtracting twice the next largest element that is x positions ahead, until k elements have been removed. The function prints the maximum sum for each test case.**
