Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, m is an integer between 1 and 10^6, x1 is an integer between 1 and 10^6, y1 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x2 is an integer between 1 and 10^6, y2 is an integer between 1 and 10^9, r is a list of six integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains six integers, and assigns them to the variables n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2. The values of these variables are within the specified ranges. The variable r is a list of these six integers. After the execution of the code, stdin contains one less test case.
