Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game based on the positions of the two chips on the board. The program takes into account the relative positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board, and it prints the correct result for each test case.

The program's logic is as follows:

- If Bob's chip is in a row that is not greater than Alice's chip, the game is a draw.
- If the difference between Bob's row and Alice's row is odd, and Alice's chip and Bob's chip are in the same column, Alice wins.
- If the difference between Bob's row and Alice's row is even, and Alice's chip and Bob's chip are in the same column, Bob wins.
- In all other cases, the game is a draw.

This logic is correct based on the problem description, which states that a player wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the other player's chip, and that the game is a draw if either player cannot make a move.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
