Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two chips on a board. The function takes no parameters and returns nothing. It reads input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of the chips. The function prints the result of each test case, either 'draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', depending on the relative positions of the chips. The function does not modify the input variables and does not return any value.**
