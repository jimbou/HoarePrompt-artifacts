Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when Alice's chip is in the last row (x_a = h) and Bob's chip is in the first row (x_b = 1). In this case, the game should end in a draw, but the program does not check for this condition.

For example, if the input is:

```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```

The program will output "Draw", but it should output "Draw" because Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, and the game should end in a draw.

The program only checks if x2 <= x1, but it does not check if x_a = h and x_b = 1, which is a necessary condition for the game to end in a draw.
