#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers.
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: arr is a list of non-negative integers, freq is a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in arr and the values are their respective frequencies.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique element in the list 'arr' by 4.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique element in the input list 'arr' by 4 and returns the result. It takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns an integer value. The function does not modify the input list.
