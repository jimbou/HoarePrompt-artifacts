This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string a of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It calculates the minimum index at which the percentage of zeros and ones in the string is greater than or equal to 50%. If no such index exists, it returns 0 if the percentage of ones is greater than or equal to 50% and n otherwise. The function outputs a list of these minimum indices, one for each test case.
