Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer n and a string a of length n containing only 0s and 1s.

2. It correctly calculates the number of zeros and ones in the string a.

3. It iterates through the string a and checks for each index i whether the percentage of zeros on the left side (i.e., from index 0 to i) and the percentage of ones on the right side (i.e., from index i+1 to n-1) are both greater than or equal to 50%. If this condition is met, it adds the index i+1 to the list lst.

4. It finds the minimum absolute difference between the middle index pk and each index in the list lst. If there are multiple indices with the same minimum difference, it selects the smallest one.

5. If the list lst is empty, it means that there is no index i that satisfies the condition. In this case, it checks whether the percentage of ones in the string a is greater than or equal to 50%. If it is, it sets the final answer to 0; otherwise, it sets the final answer to n.

6. Finally, it prints the final answer for each test case.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
