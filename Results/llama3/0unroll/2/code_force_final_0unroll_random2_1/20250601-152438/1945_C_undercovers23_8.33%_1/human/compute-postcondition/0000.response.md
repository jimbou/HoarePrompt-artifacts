Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, because one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. Each test case still contains two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.
