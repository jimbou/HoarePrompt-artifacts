Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by processing all commands in the order they are written in the string s. The function func_1 first rearranges the elements of list a based on the characters in string s, then calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged list in reverse order, and returns the result as a list of n integers. The main part of the program reads the input, calls func_1, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
