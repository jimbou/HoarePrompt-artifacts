#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, s is a string of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R'.
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: b is a list of n positive integers, l is n, r is -1, ans is a list of n integers where each element at index i is the product of all integers in b from index n-1 to n-i, p is 1.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list of 'ans' where each element at index i is the product of all integers in list 'b' from index n-1 to n-i.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes in a positive integer n, a positive integer m, a list of n positive integers a, and a string s of n characters where each character is either 'L' or 'R'. It rearranges the elements of list a based on the characters in string s, then calculates the cumulative product of the rearranged list in reverse order, and returns the result as a list of n integers.
