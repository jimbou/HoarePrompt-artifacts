Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, r is the same lambda function**.

In this output state, the loop has executed all the iterations and the variable t has been decremented to 0. The stdin has been consumed by the loop and is now empty. The lambda function r remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop head and body.
