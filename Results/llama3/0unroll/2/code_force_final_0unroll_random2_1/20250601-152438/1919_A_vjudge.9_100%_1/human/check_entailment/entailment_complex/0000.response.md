Reasoning:

The given program is correct. The problem description states that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses, and the game is won by the player who can make a valid move when the other player cannot. The key insight here is that the game is won by the player who has the opportunity to make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

If the absolute difference is even, Bob will win, because no matter what move Alice makes, Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with no valid moves. On the other hand, if the absolute difference is odd, Alice will win, because she can always make a move that leaves Bob with no valid moves.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and printing 'Bob' if it is even and 'Alice' if it is odd.

Correctness: **True**
