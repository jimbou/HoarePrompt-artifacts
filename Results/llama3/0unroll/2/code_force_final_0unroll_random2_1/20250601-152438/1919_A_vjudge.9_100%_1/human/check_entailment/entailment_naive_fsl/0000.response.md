Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines the winner of the game based on the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the player who can make the last move will win the game. Since the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, the player who has the opportunity to make the last move will be the one who has the wallet with the smaller number of coins.

The program uses the fact that if the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob will win, and if the difference is odd, then Alice will win. This is because if the difference is even, then Alice will always be forced to make the last move, and if the difference is odd, then Bob will always be forced to make the last move.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob", and if the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
