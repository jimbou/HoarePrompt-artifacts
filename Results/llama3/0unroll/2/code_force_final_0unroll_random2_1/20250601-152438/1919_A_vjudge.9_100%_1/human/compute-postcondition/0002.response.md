Output State: The output will be a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed to the console, with the number of lines equal to the initial value of `t`. Each line will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd or even, respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged.
