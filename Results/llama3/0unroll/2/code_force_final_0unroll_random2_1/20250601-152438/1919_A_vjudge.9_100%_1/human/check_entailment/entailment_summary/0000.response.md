Reasoning:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

If the absolute difference is even, Bob will win because Alice will be forced to make a move that will leave Bob with a wallet that has an odd number of coins, allowing Bob to make the last move. On the other hand, if the absolute difference is odd, Alice will win because she can make a move that will leave Bob with a wallet that has an even number of coins, forcing Bob to make a move that will leave Alice with a wallet that has an odd number of coins, allowing Alice to make the last move.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between the input integers `a` and `b` and printing "Bob" if the difference is even and "Alice" if the difference is odd.

Correctness: **True**
