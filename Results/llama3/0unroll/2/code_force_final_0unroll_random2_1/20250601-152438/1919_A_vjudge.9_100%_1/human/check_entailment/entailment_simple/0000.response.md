Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, `a` and `b`, respectively.

The program then uses a simple conditional statement to determine the winner. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

The reasoning behind this approach is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity game. Since the players alternate turns, the player who starts with the higher number of coins will always have the opportunity to make the last move, unless the difference between the number of coins is even. In the latter case, the player who starts with the lower number of coins can always mirror the moves of the other player, ensuring that they will make the last move.

Therefore, the program's logic is correct, and it will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
