The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). After the code is executed, the first integer `t` is removed from the stdin, leaving `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**
