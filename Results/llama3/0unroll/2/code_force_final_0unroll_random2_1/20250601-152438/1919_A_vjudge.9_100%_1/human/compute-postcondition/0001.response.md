Output State: The output will be a series of 'Alice' or 'Bob' printed to the console, one for each pair of integers in the input. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`. Each line will contain either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on whether the absolute difference between the two integers is even ('Bob') or odd ('Alice').
