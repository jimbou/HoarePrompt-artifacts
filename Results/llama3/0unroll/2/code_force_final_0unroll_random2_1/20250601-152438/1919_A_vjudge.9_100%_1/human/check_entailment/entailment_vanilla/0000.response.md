Reasoning:

The problem statement describes a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.

The provided program uses a simple approach to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, `a` and `b`, respectively.

The program then uses the following logic to determine the winner:

* If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even (`abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
* Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

The reasoning behind this logic is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity game. The player who starts with the smaller number of coins can always mirror the moves of the other player, ensuring that the difference between the number of coins remains even. If the difference is even, Bob will always have a move available, while Alice will eventually run out of coins. Conversely, if the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even difference, forcing him to eventually run out of coins.

This logic is correct, and the program accurately implements it.

Correctness: **True**
