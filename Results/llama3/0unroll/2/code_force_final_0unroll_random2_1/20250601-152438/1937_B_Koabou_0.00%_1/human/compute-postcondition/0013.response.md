Functionality: **This function reads two binary strings of the same length from standard input, modifies the second string by replacing its prefix with the corresponding prefix from the first string if the first string has a '1' at a position where the second string has a '0', and then prints the modified string and the length of the longest common prefix between the modified string and the first string.**
