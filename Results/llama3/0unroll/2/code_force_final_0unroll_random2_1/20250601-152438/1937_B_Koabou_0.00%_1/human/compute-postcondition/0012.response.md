Output: **`s` is a list containing two binary strings of length n, `x` is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), `t` is the maximum value of `x - i + 1` for `i` in range `x` such that `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, or 1 if no such `i` exists, and the maximum value of `x - i + 1` for `i` in range `x` such that `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]`, or 1 if no such `i` exists is printed**
