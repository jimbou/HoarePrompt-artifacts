Output State: The list s contains a binary string of length n, where the first i+1 characters are from the first string in list a, and the remaining characters are from the second string in list a. The integer x is equal to i. If no such i is found, then s contains the first string from list a with the last character replaced by the last character of the second string in list a, and x is equal to n-1.
