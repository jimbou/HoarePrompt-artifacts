Output State: **`s` is a list containing two binary strings of length n, `x` is an integer between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), `t` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been set to 1. The values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged, with `s` still being a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, and `x` still being an integer between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive).
