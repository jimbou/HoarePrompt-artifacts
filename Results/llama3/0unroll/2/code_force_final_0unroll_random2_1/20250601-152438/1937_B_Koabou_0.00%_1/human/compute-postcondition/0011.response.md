The code prints the value of `t`, which is the maximum value of `x - i + 1` for `i` in range `x` such that the first `i + 1` characters of the first binary string in the list `s` are equal to the first `i + 1` characters of the second binary string in the list `s`, or 1 if no such `i` exists.

Output: **t (where t is the maximum value of x - i + 1 for i in range x such that the first i + 1 characters of the first binary string in the list s are equal to the first i + 1 characters of the second binary string in the list s, or 1 if no such i exists)**
