Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

One such case is when the input is:

3
2
01
10

The expected output is:

010
2

However, the program outputs:

01
1

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not a prefix of the first row. 

The program assumes that the lexicographically smallest string is always a prefix of the first row, which is not always the case. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
