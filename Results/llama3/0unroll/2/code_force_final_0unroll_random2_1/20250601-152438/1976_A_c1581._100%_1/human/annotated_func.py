#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a list of digits from the password, letters is a list of letters from the password.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop will return False if the digits list is not sorted in ascending order or if the last digit in the digits list is greater than any letter in the letters list. Otherwise, the loop will finish all iterations without returning False, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, indicating that the loop has successfully executed without returning False, and the current value of `sortedPassword` remains equal to the current value of `password`, which is a concatenation of the unchanged `digits` and `letters` lists.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the loop has not met the desired condition, and the state of the variables `digits` and `letters` remains unchanged, with `sortedPassword` still being a concatenation of `digits` and `letters` but not equal to `password`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Checks if a given password is sorted in ascending order, considering digits and letters separately. The function accepts a string password as input and returns True if the password is sorted (i.e., digits are in ascending order and the last digit is not greater than any letter) and False otherwise. The function does not modify the input password.
