Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns the minimum cost.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program initializes an empty list `s` and appends each character of the input string `sChar` to it. This is unnecessary, as the input string can be directly used for iteration.

2. The program initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to 0 and 1, respectively. It also initializes a variable `cost` to 0, which will store the minimum total cost.

3. The program enters a while loop that continues until `left` is greater than `right` or `right` reaches the end of the string. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at the `right` index is '0' and the character at the `left` index is '1'. If this condition is true, it swaps the characters at the `right` and `left` indices and increments the `cost` by `right - left + 1`.

4. After the swap, the program increments the `right` pointer until it finds a '0' or reaches the end of the string.

5. The program then increments the `left` pointer until it finds a '1' or reaches the end of the string.

6. The loop continues until the `left` pointer is greater than the `right` pointer or the `right` pointer reaches the end of the string.

7. Finally, the program returns the `cost`, which represents the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

* The program uses a list `s` to store the characters of the input string, which is unnecessary. The input string can be directly used for iteration.

* The program uses a while loop with multiple conditions, which can be simplified using a for loop.

* The program swaps characters at the `right` and `left` indices using tuple assignment, which is not necessary. A simple swap operation can be used instead.

* The program increments the `cost` by `right - left + 1` after swapping characters, which is incorrect. The correct increment should be `right - left`.

* The program does not handle the case where the input string is already sorted.

Correctness: **False**
