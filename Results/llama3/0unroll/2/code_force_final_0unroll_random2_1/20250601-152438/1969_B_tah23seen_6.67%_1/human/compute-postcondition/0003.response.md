Output State: **sChar is a binary string of length at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, s is a list containing all the characters from sChar, left is 0, cost is 0, right is 1**

The code snippet initializes three new variables: `left`, `cost`, and `right`. The first line assigns the value 0 to `left`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `cost`. The third line assigns the value 1 to `right`. These assignments do not affect the existing variables `sChar` and `s`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes the initial state of `sChar` and `s`, along with the newly assigned values of `left`, `cost`, and `right`.
