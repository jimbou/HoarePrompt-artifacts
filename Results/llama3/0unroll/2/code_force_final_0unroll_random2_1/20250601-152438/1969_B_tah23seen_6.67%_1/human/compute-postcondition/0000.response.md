Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string of length at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is an empty list**.

In this output state, the value of `sChar` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. However, a new variable `s` is introduced and assigned an empty list. The length of `sChar` is still within the range of 2 to 2 * 10^5, and it still consists only of 0s and/or 1s.
