Output State: **left is the index of the last '1' in s, right is the index of the last '0' in s, cost is the total number of swaps performed to move all '0's to the right of all '1's, s is the modified list with all '0's to the right of all '1's.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has rearranged the list `s` such that all '0's are to the right of all '1's, and the variables `left` and `right` point to the last '1' and '0' in the list, respectively. The `cost` variable keeps track of the total number of swaps performed to achieve this arrangement.
