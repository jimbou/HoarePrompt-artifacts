Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. The program uses a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input, converts it into a list `s`, and then rearranges the elements in `s` to move all '0's to the right of all '1's by swapping elements. The function returns the total number of swaps performed to achieve this rearrangement.

The program's logic is correct. It iterates through the list `s` and swaps elements when it encounters a '0' to the right of a '1'. It also keeps track of the indices of the last '1' and '0' encountered, which helps in determining the cost of the swaps. The cost is calculated as the difference between the indices of the swapped elements plus one.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not handle the case where the input string is already sorted. In such cases, the program should return 0 as the cost, but the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
