Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, considering the price per ticket for each day and the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k). It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program sorts the prices in ascending order, which is a crucial step in finding the minimum spending. It then initializes a variable s to 0, which will store the total cost, and a variable c to k * k / 2, which is the sum of the first k natural numbers.

The program then iterates over the sorted prices. In each iteration, it calculates the minimum of m and k, which is the number of tickets that can be bought on the current day. It then subtracts this number from k and adds the cost of buying these tickets to c. The cost is calculated as the price per ticket multiplied by the number of tickets bought, minus the sum of the first s natural numbers (s*(s-1)/2), where s is the number of tickets bought.

Finally, the program prints the total cost c after all iterations of the loop.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days. However, there is a potential issue with the program's time complexity. The sorting operation has a time complexity of O(n log n), which could be a bottleneck for large inputs. A more efficient solution might use a heap or a priority queue to find the minimum price in O(log n) time.

Correctness: **True**
