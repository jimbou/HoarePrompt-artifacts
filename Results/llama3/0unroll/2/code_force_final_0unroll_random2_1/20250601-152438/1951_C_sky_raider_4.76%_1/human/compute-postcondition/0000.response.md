Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the total cost of buying k tickets over n days, considering the price per ticket for each day and the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day. The total cost is calculated by summing up the cost of buying the minimum of m or k tickets each day, where the cost is the price per ticket multiplied by the number of tickets bought, minus the sum of the first s natural numbers (s*(s+1)/2), where s is the number of tickets bought. The total cost is then printed as an integer.
