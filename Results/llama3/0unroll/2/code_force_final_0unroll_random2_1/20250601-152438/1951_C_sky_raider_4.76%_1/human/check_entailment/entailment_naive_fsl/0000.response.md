Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the total cost. The program sorts the list of prices and then iterates over the sorted list, purchasing the maximum possible tickets on each day. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that the prices increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices to get [2, 4, 6, 8]. Then, it will purchase 2 tickets on the first day (price 2), 1 ticket on the second day (price 4), and 0 tickets on the third and fourth days. The total cost will be calculated as 2*2 + 1*4 = 8. However, this is not the minimum possible cost. A better approach would be to purchase 1 ticket on the third day (price 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (price 2 + 2 = 4), resulting in a total cost of 4 + 4 = 8.

The program does not consider this optimal solution and therefore produces an incorrect result.
