You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, m, and k, where n is the number of sale days, m is the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and k is the number of tickets to be bought at the end. The second line contains n space-separated integers: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where a_i is the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        s = 0
        
        c = k * k / 2
        
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        
        print(int(c))
        
    #State: The output state is the total cost of buying k tickets over n days, considering the price per ticket for each day and the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day. The total cost is calculated by summing up the cost of buying the minimum of m or k tickets each day, where the cost is the price per ticket multiplied by the number of tickets bought, minus the sum of the first s natural numbers (s*(s-1)/2), where s is the number of tickets bought. The output is the total cost after all iterations of the loop.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
