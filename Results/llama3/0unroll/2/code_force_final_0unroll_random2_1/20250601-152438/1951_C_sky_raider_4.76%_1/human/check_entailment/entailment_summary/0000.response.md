Reasoning: 

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then iterating through the sorted list. In each iteration, it calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day, which is the minimum of the maximum daily purchase limit (m) and the remaining number of tickets to buy (k). It then updates the remaining number of tickets to buy (k) and calculates the cost of buying the tickets on the current day.

However, the program has a logical error. The cost calculation is incorrect. The correct cost should be the sum of the ticket prices for the purchased tickets, not the ticket price multiplied by the number of purchased tickets minus the square of the number of purchased tickets divided by 2.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where the number of tickets to buy (k) is greater than the maximum daily purchase limit (m) multiplied by the number of days (n). In this case, it is not possible to buy all the tickets, and the program should output an error message or handle this case in some other way.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
