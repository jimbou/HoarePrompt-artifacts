Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, considering the price per ticket for each day and the maximum amount of tickets that can be bought each day.

The program first reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k). It then reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program sorts the prices per ticket in ascending order, which is a crucial step in finding the minimum spending. It then initializes a variable 's' to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of tickets bought, and a variable 'c' to k * k / 2, which is the sum of the first k natural numbers.

The program then enters a loop that runs for n iterations. In each iteration, it calculates the number of tickets that can be bought on the current day, which is the minimum of m and k. It then subtracts this number from k and updates the total cost 'c' by adding the cost of buying the tickets on the current day, which is the price per ticket multiplied by the number of tickets bought, minus the sum of the first s natural numbers (s*(s-1)/2), where s is the number of tickets bought.

Finally, the program prints the total cost 'c' after all iterations of the loop, which is the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days.

Correctness: **True**
