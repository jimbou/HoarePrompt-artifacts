Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the number of lamps is 1 and the desired configuration is '1'. In this case, the program will print 'no', but the correct answer is 'yes' because we can turn on the only lamp.

Also, the program has redundant conditions. The condition `if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:` is checked twice, which is unnecessary.

Additionally, the program can be simplified by removing the unnecessary conditions and directly checking if the count of '1's is even or odd. If it's even, we can reach the configuration, otherwise, we can't.
