The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer representing the number of lamps and a binary string representing the desired configuration. It then determines whether the desired configuration can be achieved and outputs 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, depending on whether the number of '1's in the binary string is even and does not contain consecutive '1's. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the input stream empty.
