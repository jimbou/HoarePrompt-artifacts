Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given binary string can be achieved by turning on non-adjacent lamps. The program checks two conditions:

1. The number of '1's in the binary string is even. This is because each operation turns on two lamps, so the total number of '1's must be even.
2. The binary string does not contain consecutive '1's. This is because the operation cannot turn on adjacent lamps.

The program correctly handles these conditions and outputs 'yes' or 'no' accordingly. It also correctly handles the case where the number of '1's is 2 and there are consecutive '1's, which is a special case that needs to be handled separately.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
