#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers.
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]

    #State: Output State: `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all suffixes of `a`, `a` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #
    #*   The outer loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
    #*   For each element `a[i]`, the inner loop calculates the cumulative sum of all elements from `a[i]` to the end of the list `a`.
    #*   The cumulative sum is appended to the list `cts` at each iteration of the inner loop.
    #*   After the outer loop finishes, `cts` contains the cumulative sums of all suffixes of `a`.
    #*   The list `a` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns a sorted list of cumulative sums of all suffixes of list 'a', where 'a' remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the cumulative sums of all suffixes of a given list of non-negative integers, sorts these sums in ascending order, and returns the sorted list without modifying the original input list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers.
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
        
    #State: Output State: `cts` is a list of integers, `odds` is a list of integers that contains the first and last elements of `cts` that are not equal to each other, as well as any elements in between that are not equal to the last element of `odds`.
    return odds
    #The program returns a list of integers that contains the first and last elements of `cts` that are not equal to each other, as well as any elements in between that are not equal to the last element of `odds`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing the first and last elements of the input list that are not equal to each other, as well as any elements in between that are not equal to the last element of the output list. The function effectively filters out consecutive duplicate elements from the input list, preserving the first occurrence of each element and the last occurrence of each element that is not equal to the previous one.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer such that n is odd and n >= 3, and the length of odds is equal to (n-1)/2 + 1.
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: a is a list of n integers, prev is the last element of odds, idx is -((n - 1) // 2), odds is a list of positive integers, n is a positive integer such that n is odd and n >= 3, and the length of odds is equal to (n-1)/2 + 1.
    return a
    #The program returns a list of n integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs a list of n integers by processing a list of positive integers (odds) and an odd integer n (>= 3). It returns a list of n integers, where the middle element(s) are assigned values from the input list, and the remaining elements are assigned values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the input list. The function does not modify the input list or the value of n.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than smallList, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are equal.
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than or equal to smallList, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are not equal.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list bigList, which is not equal to the last element of the list smallList.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two lists of integers, bigList and smallList, and returns the last element of bigList that is not equal to the last element of smallList. If the last elements of both lists are equal, it removes the last elements from both lists until it finds a pair of last elements that are not equal, and then returns the last element of bigList.
