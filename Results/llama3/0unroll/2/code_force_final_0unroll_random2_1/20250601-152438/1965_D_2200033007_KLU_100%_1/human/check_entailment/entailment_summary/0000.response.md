Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of recovering a hidden palindrome array from the sums of its distinct subarrays. The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific task.

Function 1 calculates the cumulative sums of all suffixes of a given list of non-negative integers, sorts these sums in ascending order, and returns the sorted list.

Function 2 filters out consecutive duplicate elements from the input list, preserving the first occurrence of each element and the last occurrence of each element that is not equal to the previous one.

Function 3 constructs a list of n integers by processing a list of positive integers and an odd integer n (>= 3). It returns a list of n integers, where the middle element(s) are assigned values from the input list, and the remaining elements are assigned values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the input list.

Function 4 compares two lists of integers and returns the last element of the first list that is not equal to the last element of the second list. If the last elements of both lists are equal, it removes the last elements from both lists until it finds a pair of last elements that are not equal, and then returns the last element of the first list.

The main program uses these functions to recover the hidden palindrome array. It first reads the input, sorts the subarray sums, and finds the missing sum. Then, it constructs the palindrome array using Function 3 and prints the result.

Based on the execution summaries of the functions and the problem description, the program correctly implements the required logic to recover the hidden palindrome array. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
