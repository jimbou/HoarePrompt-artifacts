Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of integers, bigList is longer than or equal to smallList, and the last elements of bigList and smallList are not equal.**

In this output state, the loop has removed all the common elements from the end of both lists until it found a pair of elements that were not equal or until one of the lists became empty. As a result, the last elements of bigList and smallList are no longer equal, and bigList is either longer than or equal to smallList.
