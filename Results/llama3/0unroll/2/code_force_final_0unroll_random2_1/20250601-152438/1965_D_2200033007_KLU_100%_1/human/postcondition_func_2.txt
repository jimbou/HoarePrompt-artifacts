The function constructs a list of n integers by processing a list of positive integers (odds) and an odd integer n (>= 3). It returns a list of n integers, where the middle element(s) are assigned values from the input list, and the remaining elements are assigned values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the input list. The function does not modify the input list or the value of n.
