Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to recover a palindrome array `a` from the given sums of its distinct subarrays. The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`.

`func_1` generates all possible subarray sums of a given array `a` and sorts them. `func_2` removes duplicates from the sorted list of subarray sums, keeping only the odd counts. `func_3` constructs the palindrome array `a` from the odd counts of subarray sums. `func_4` is not used in the provided code, but it seems to be a helper function to remove common elements from the end of two lists.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. Generate all possible subarray sums of the unknown palindrome array `a` using `func_1`.
2. Remove duplicates from the sorted list of subarray sums, keeping only the odd counts using `func_2`.
3. Construct the palindrome array `a` from the odd counts of subarray sums using `func_3`.

The program's correctness can be argued as follows:

* `func_1` correctly generates all possible subarray sums of the unknown palindrome array `a`.
* `func_2` correctly removes duplicates from the sorted list of subarray sums, keeping only the odd counts.
* `func_3` correctly constructs the palindrome array `a` from the odd counts of subarray sums.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly recovers the palindrome array `a` from the given sums of its distinct subarrays. Therefore, the program is correct.

Note that the program assumes that the input is well-formed, i.e., the given sums of subarrays are correct and the unknown array `a` is a palindrome. If the input is not well-formed, the program may not work correctly. However, based on the problem description, it is assumed that the input is well-formed.
