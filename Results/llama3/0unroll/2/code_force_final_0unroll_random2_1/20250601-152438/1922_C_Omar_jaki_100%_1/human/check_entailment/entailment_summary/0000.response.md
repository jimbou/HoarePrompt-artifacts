Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another city. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive cities, which allows it to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins needed for each query. The program also correctly handles the case where the closest city is unique for each city, as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
