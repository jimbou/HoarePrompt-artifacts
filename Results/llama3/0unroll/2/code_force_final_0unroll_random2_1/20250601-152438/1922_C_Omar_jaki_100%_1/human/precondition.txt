stdin contains a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n, a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, an integer m, and m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is sorted in ascending order, and for each city i, there is a unique closest city j.
