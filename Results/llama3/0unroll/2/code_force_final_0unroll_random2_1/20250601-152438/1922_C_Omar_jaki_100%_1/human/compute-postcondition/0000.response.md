Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of unique non-decreasing integers, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. The list of integers is non-empty and contains unique non-decreasing integers. The integer is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The list of pairs of integers is non-empty and contains pairs of unique integers that are present in the list of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a map. The function `r` is then called to read the first input, which is a positive integer `t`. This input is read from stdin, leaving the remaining test cases in stdin. The value of `t` is assigned to the variable `t`. No other variables are affected.
