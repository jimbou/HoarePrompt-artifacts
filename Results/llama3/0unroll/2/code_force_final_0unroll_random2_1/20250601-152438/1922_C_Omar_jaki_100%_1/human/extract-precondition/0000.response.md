Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique non-decreasing integers, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is a positive integer. The list of integers is non-empty and contains unique non-decreasing integers. The second integer is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the list of integers. The list of pairs of integers is non-empty and contains pairs of unique integers that are present in the list of integers.**
