Output State: **t is 0, stdin contains no test cases, and the output contains the results of all the test cases.**

In this output state, the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variable t has been decremented to 0. The stdin has been fully processed, and all the test cases have been executed. The output contains the results of all the test cases, which are the differences between the cumulative sums of the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers, calculated for each pair of integers in the list of pairs.
