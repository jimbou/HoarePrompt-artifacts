This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing a list of unique non-decreasing integers and a list of pairs of unique integers. It then calculates and prints the results of all test cases, where each result is the difference between the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive integers in the list, up to the second integer in the pair, and the cumulative sum of differences up to the first integer in the pair. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, leaving the standard input empty and the output containing the results of all test cases.
