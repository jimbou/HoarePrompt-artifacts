Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of problems in the bank (n) is less than the number of upcoming rounds (m). In this case, the program will output a negative number, which is incorrect. The correct output should be the difference between the number of upcoming rounds and the number of problems in the bank.

For example, if n = 3 and m = 5, the program will output -2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2, because Vlad needs to come up with 2 more problems to hold 5 rounds.

The program can be corrected by adding a condition to check if n is less than m, and if so, output the difference between m and n.
