Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans` will hold the total count of pairs of integers in the input sequence `a` for each test case, and this count will be printed to the standard output. The input stream `stdin` will be exhausted, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `cnt` will hold the values from the last test case. The loop variable `_` will be equal to the number of test cases.
