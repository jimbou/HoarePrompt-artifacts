The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` assigns the `readline` method of `sys.stdin` to the variable `input`. This means that `input` now reads input from standard input one line at a time, instead of reading the entire input at once.

Output State: **`input` is now a function that reads input from standard input one line at a time, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= n) â€” the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
