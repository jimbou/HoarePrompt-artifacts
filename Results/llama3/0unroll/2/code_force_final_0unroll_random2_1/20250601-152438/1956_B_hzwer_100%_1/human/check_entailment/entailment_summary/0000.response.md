Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. The program uses a count array to count the frequency of each integer in the input sequence. Then, it iterates over the count array and adds the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 to the answer. This is because if the count of an integer is greater than 1, it means that the player has a pair of that integer, and they can score a point by playing one of the cards.

The program handles all the test cases correctly and prints the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
