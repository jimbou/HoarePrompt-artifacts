Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given list of integers can be rearranged into this pattern. The function `func_1` takes the size of the square `n`, the values of `c` and `d`, and the list of integers `l` as input. It first finds the minimum value `a` in the list, which is the top-left element of the progressive square. Then, it constructs the progressive square by iterating over the rows and columns, calculating the value of each element using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, and stores these values in the list `li`. The list `li` is then sorted and compared with the sorted list `l`. If they are equal, the function returns 'yes', indicating that the list can be rearranged into the progressive square pattern. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the function, and the example inputs and outputs match the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
