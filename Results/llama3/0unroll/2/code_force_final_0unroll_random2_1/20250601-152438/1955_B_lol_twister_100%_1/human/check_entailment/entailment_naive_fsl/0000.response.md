Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly constructs the progressive square based on the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, and then checks if the elements of the array `l` match the elements of the constructed square.

The program first finds the minimum element `a` in the array `l`, which is assumed to be the top-left element of the progressive square. It then constructs the square by iterating over the rows and columns, adding `c` times the row index and `d` times the column index to `a`. The constructed square is then sorted and compared with the sorted array `l`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the array `l` does not contain the elements of a progressive square, in which case it returns 'no'. The program also correctly handles the case where the array `l` contains duplicate elements, which is allowed in the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
