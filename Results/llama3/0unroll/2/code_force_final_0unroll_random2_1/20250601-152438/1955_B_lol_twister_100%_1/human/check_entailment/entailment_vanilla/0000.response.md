Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square of size n, based on the provided values of n, c, and d.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, c, and d, and the array of integers (l).

3. The function func_1 is called with these values as arguments.

4. Inside func_1, the minimum value in the array (a) is found. This is because the problem statement specifies that the top-left element of the progressive square is the minimum value in the array.

5. The function then generates the elements of the progressive square based on the formula a + k * c + d * h, where k and h are the row and column indices, respectively. These elements are stored in the list li.

6. The list li is sorted in ascending order.

7. The input array l is also sorted in ascending order.

8. The function then checks if the sorted list li is equal to the sorted array l. If they are equal, it means that the array l can be rearranged into a progressive square, and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
