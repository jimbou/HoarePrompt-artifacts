Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a progressive square can be constructed from the given array elements. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the input values of n, c, and d, and the array b.

2. It then calculates the value of a (a_{1,1}) by finding the minimum element in the array b. This is correct because the rules of the progressive square state that a_{1,1} is the smallest element in the square.

3. The program then constructs the list li by iterating over all possible positions in the square and calculating the corresponding element using the formula a + k * c + d * h. This is correct because the rules of the progressive square state that each element is calculated using this formula.

4. The program then sorts both lists li and l. This is correct because the problem statement requires that the elements in the array b are in random order, and the program needs to compare the sorted lists to determine if they are equal.

5. Finally, the program checks if the sorted lists li and l are equal. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that a progressive square can be constructed from the array elements. If they are not equal, it returns 'no', indicating that a progressive square cannot be constructed from the array elements. This is correct because the problem statement requires that the program determine if the elements in the array b can form a progressive square.

Correctness: **True**
