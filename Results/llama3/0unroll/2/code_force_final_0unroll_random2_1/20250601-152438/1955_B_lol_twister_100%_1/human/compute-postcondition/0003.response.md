Output State: **li is a sorted list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list, all other variables remain unchanged.**

The code snippet sorts the list `li` in ascending order, and then sorts another list `l` in ascending order. The initial state of `li` is a list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, and the code does not modify the values of these integers. The sorting operation only rearranges the elements of the list. The list `l` is also sorted, but its initial state is not specified, so we can only conclude that it is sorted after the code execution. All other variables remain unchanged.
