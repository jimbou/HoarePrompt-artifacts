Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if a given list of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square pattern. The program first finds the minimum value in the list, which is the top-left element of the square. It then generates the expected pattern of the square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the minimum value, `k` is the row index, and `h` is the column index. The program then sorts both the expected pattern and the input list, and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list can be rearranged into the progressive square pattern. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem statement, such as the size of the square (`n`), the values of `c` and `d`, and the range of the integers in the list. The program also correctly sorts the lists before comparing them, which is necessary to ensure that the comparison is done correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
