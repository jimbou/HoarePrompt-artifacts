#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1.
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
        
    #State: Output State: li is a list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, all other variables remain unchanged.
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if (l == li) :
        return 'yes'
        #The program returns the string 'yes'. The list 'l' remains a sorted list and is equal to 'li', which is a sorted list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #State: *li is a sorted list of n^2 integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list, all other variables remain unchanged. l is not equal to li
    return 'no'
    #The program returns the string 'no'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if a given list of integers can be rearranged into a specific pattern. It takes four parameters: an integer n, integers c and d, and a list l of n^2 integers. The function returns 'yes' if the list can be rearranged into the pattern a + k * c + d * h, where a is the minimum value in the list, and 'no' otherwise. The original list is sorted in the process, and all other variables remain unchanged.
