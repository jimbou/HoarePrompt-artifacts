Output State: **stdin is empty, data is a list of strings, index is 1, t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), results is an empty list**.

The code reads all input from stdin and stores it in the `data` list. The `index` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The `results` list is initialized to store the results of each test case. Since the code only reads the first element of `data` and assigns it to `t`, the remaining elements in `data` are not processed. The `index` is incremented to 1, indicating that the next element in `data` is ready to be processed.
