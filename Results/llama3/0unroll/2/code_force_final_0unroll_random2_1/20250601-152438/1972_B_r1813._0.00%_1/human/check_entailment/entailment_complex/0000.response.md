Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the result. The logic for determining whether Alice will win the game is also correct. The program checks if the number of 'U' characters in the string is odd or even. If it's odd, Alice will win, and if it's even, Bob will win. This is because, in a circular arrangement of coins, if there are an odd number of 'U' coins, Alice can always make a move that will leave Bob with an even number of 'U' coins, forcing him to lose. On the other hand, if there are an even number of 'U' coins, Bob can always make a move that will leave Alice with an odd number of 'U' coins, forcing her to lose.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the result to standard output.

Correctness: **True**
