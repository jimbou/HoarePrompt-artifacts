This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a string (s) of length n containing only "U" and "D" characters. It then determines whether the number of "U" characters in each string is odd or even and outputs "YES" if odd and "NO" if even, one output per test case. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the standard input empty and the data list and results list in a modified state.
