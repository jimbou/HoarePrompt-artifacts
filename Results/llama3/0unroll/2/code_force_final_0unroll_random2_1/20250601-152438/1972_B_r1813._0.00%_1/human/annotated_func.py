#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and then a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D".
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: stdin is empty, data is a list of strings, index is t*2 + 1, t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), results is a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the number of 'U' characters in the corresponding string in the data list.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: stdin is empty, data is a list of strings, index is t*2 + 1, t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), results is an empty list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a string (s) of length n containing only "U" and "D" characters. It then determines whether the number of "U" characters in each string is odd or even and outputs "YES" if odd and "NO" if even, one output per test case. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the standard input empty and the data list and results list in a modified state.
