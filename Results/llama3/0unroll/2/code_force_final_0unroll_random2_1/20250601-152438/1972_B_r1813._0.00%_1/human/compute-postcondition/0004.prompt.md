Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: stdin is empty, data is a list of strings, index is t*2 + 1, t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), results is a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the number of 'U' characters in the corresponding string in the data list.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
