Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly handles the case when `n` is 1 by printing `k` directly.

2. For `n` greater than 1, the program calculates the largest power of 2 less than `k` and appends it to the `ans` list. This is done by repeatedly multiplying `temp` by 2 until it is no longer less than `k`. The number of times this is done is stored in `i`, and the largest power of 2 less than `k` is calculated as `(1 << i) - 1`.

3. The program then appends the difference between `k` and the sum of the elements in `ans` to `ans`. This ensures that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`.

4. The program then appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to `ans` to ensure that `ans` contains `n` elements.

5. Finally, the program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
