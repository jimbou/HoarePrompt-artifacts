This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, if n is 1, it prints the value of k. If n is greater than 1, it calculates the largest power of 2 less than k, subtracts this value from k, and prints the result as a list of n integers, where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than k, the second integer is the difference between k and the first integer, and the remaining integers are all 0. The function repeats this process for each test case, printing the results in the specified format.
