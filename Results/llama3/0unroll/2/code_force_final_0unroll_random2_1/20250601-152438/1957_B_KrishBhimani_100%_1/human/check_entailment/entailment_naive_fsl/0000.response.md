Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when `n` is greater than 2 and `k` is less than `2^(i+1) - 1` where `i` is the number of bits required to represent `k`. In this case, the program will try to append `(1 << i) - 1` to the answer array, which is greater than `k`, resulting in an incorrect solution.

For example, when `n = 3` and `k = 5`, the program will try to append `7` to the answer array, which is greater than `5`. This will result in an incorrect solution.

To fix this issue, the program needs to handle the case when `k` is less than `2^(i+1) - 1` separately. One possible solution is to append `k` to the answer array and then append `0`s to fill the remaining `n-1` positions.
