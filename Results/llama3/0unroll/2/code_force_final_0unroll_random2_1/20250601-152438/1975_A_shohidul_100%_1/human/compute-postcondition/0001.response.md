Output State: **The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each corresponding to a test case. If the input list is already sorted in ascending order, the output is 'YES'. If not, the code checks if there is a point where the list can be split into two sorted parts, with the first part being in descending order and the second part being in ascending order. If such a point exists, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings is equal to the value of 't', which is the number of test cases.**
