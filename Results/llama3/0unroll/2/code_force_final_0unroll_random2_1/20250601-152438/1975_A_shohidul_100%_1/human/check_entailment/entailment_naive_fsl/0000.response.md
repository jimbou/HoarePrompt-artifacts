Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, if the input is [3, 1, 2, 3], the program will output 'NO', but the correct output should be 'YES' because the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after swapping the prefix and suffix.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix once. However, the problem statement allows for multiple swaps. Therefore, the program should check all possible swaps, not just the first one.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
3 1 2 3
```
Expected output:
```
YES
```
Actual output:
```
NO
```
This shows that the program does not work correctly in all cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
