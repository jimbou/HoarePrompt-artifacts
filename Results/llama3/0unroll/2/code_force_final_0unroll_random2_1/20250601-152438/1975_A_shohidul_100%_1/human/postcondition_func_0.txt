This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It checks if the integers are sorted in ascending order. If they are, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if there is a point where the list can be split into two sorted parts, with the first part being in descending order and the second part being in ascending order. If such a point exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' strings for each case.
