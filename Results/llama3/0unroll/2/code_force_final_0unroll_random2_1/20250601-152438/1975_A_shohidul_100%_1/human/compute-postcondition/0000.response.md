Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50). The second line contains n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is larger than 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
