Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly checks if the input list is already sorted in ascending order. If not, it checks if there is a point where the list can be split into two sorted parts, with the first part being in descending order and the second part being in ascending order. This is done by iterating over the list and checking if the current element is greater than the next element. If such a point exists, the program checks if the first element of the second part is less than or equal to all elements in the second part, and if all elements in the second part are in ascending order. If both conditions are met, the program outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
