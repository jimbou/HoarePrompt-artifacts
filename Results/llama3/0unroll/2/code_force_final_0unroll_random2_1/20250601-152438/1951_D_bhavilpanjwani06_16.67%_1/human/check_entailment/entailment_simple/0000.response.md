Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases based on the problem description. If Alice has less coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it prints 'NO'. If Alice has the same number of coins as the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it prints 'YES', 1, and the number of coins Alice has. If Alice has more coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it checks if the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy minus 1 is less than the difference between the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy plus 1. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES', 2, the difference between the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy plus 1, and 1. If this condition is false, it prints 'NO'. This logic is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
