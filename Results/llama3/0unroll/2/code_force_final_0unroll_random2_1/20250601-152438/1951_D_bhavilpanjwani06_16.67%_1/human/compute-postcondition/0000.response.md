Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are assigned the two positive integers from the first line of input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.
