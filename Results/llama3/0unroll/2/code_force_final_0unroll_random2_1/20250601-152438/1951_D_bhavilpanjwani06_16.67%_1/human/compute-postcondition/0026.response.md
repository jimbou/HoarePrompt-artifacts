Functionality: **Determines if Alice can buy a certain number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the number of jewels she can buy and the remaining coins.**

The function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, respectively. It then checks if `n` is less than `k` and prints 'NO' if true. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it checks if `n` is equal to `k` and prints 'YES', 1, and the value of `n` if true. If `n` is not equal to `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1` and prints 'YES', 2, `n-k+1`, and 1 if true. If `k-1` is greater than or equal to `n-k+1`, it prints 'NO'.
