Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly handles all possible cases:

1. If Alice has less coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it prints "NO".
2. If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it prints "YES", 1, and the number of coins (which is equal to the number of jewels).
3. If Alice has more coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it checks if the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy minus 1 is less than the difference between the number of coins and the number of jewels plus 1. If this condition is true, it prints "YES", 2, the difference between the number of coins and the number of jewels plus 1, and 1. If this condition is false, it prints "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can buy a certain number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the number of jewels she can buy and the remaining coins.

Correctness: **True**
