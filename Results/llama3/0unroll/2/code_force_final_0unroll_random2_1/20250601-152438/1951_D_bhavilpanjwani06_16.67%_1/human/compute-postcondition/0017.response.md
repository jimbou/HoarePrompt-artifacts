Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 1000) â€” the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) â€” the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. n is larger than or equal to k. n is not equal to k. The current value of k minus 1 is less than the current value of n minus k plus 1, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed**
