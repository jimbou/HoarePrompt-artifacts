Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, then if `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, 1 is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to `k` is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1 is printed which is `n - k + 1`, and 1 is printed. If `k - 1` is larger than or equal to `n - k + 1`, then 'NO' is printed.***
