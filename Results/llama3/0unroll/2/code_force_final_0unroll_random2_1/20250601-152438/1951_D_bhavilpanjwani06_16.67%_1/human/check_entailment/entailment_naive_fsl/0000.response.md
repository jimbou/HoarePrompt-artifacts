Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`. In this case, the program prints 'NO', but it is actually possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program prints 'NO', but it is actually possible to set up the stalls as follows:

* At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins.
* At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins.
* At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins.
* At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins.
* At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins.
* At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins.
* At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin.
* At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins.

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

The program does not handle this case correctly, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
