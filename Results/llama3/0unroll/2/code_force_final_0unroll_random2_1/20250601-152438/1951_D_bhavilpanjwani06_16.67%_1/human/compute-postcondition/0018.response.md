The code prints the difference between the number of coins Alice has (`n`) and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought (`k`), plus 1, and the number 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, and `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, the difference `n - k` will be a non-negative integer. Adding 1 to this difference will result in a positive integer.

The second value printed is the number 1.

Output: **(n - k + 1) (where n is the number of coins Alice has and k is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought), 1**
