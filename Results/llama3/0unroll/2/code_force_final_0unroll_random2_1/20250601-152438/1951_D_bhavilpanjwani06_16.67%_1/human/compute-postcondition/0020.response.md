Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (0 <= t <= 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. n is larger than or equal to k. n is not equal to k. (k - 1) is larger than or equal to (n - k + 1)***
