Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments that can be formed from the given array such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in each segment is less than or equal to the given number x. The program uses a greedy approach, iterating over the bits of the numbers from most significant to least significant, and for each bit, it checks if the number of 1s in that bit position is even or odd. If it's even, it tries to divide the array into segments such that the XOR of the elements in each segment is 0 in that bit position. If it's odd, it checks if the number of 1s in that bit position is less than or equal to the corresponding bit in x. If it's not, it returns -1. Otherwise, it updates the answer with the maximum number of segments found so far. Finally, it returns the maximum of the answer and the length of the array.

Correctness: **True**
