Output State: **n and x are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, t is an empty list, ans is -1**

The code snippet provided consists of four lines. The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `x`. Since `func_3()` is not defined in the given code, we assume it returns values that satisfy the conditions 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= x < 2^30. The second line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns its return value to `a`. Again, since `func_1()` is not defined, we assume it returns a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n. The third line initializes an empty list `t` and an integer `ans` with a value of -1. 

The combined effect of these lines is that `n` and `x` are updated with new values, `a` is assigned a list of non-negative integers, and `t` and `ans` are initialized with an empty list and -1, respectively. The initial state's conditions for `n`, `x`, and `a` are maintained, and `t` and `ans` are added to the state with their respective values.
