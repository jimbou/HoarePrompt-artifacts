Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments that can be formed from the given array `a` such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in each segment is less than or equal to `x`. The program uses bit manipulation techniques to iterate through the bits of `x` and the elements of `a`, and it correctly updates the maximum count of segments with even parity.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `x` is 0 or when the length of `a` is 1. In these cases, the program returns the correct result, which is -1 or 1, respectively.

Overall, the program is well-structured and easy to follow, and it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
