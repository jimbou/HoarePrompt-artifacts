    #The program returns a list of integers that were in the space-separated list in stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns it as a list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer.

    #The program returns an integer that was provided as input through stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it without modification.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.

    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, which are the result of converting each string in the input into an integer, where the input is a space-separated list of integers from stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, converts each string into an integer, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: a string

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string from standard input, removes leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n and x are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= x < 2^30, a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n, t is a list of non-negative integers, ans is a non-negative integer.

    #The program returns the maximum value between the non-negative integer 'ans' and the length of the list 'a', where 'a' contains non-negative integers and has a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes no explicit parameters but uses the values of n, x, and a from the outer scope, where n is a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^5, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, and a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 with a length between 1 and 10^5. It performs bit manipulation operations on x and the elements of a, iterating through the bits of x from most significant to least significant. For each bit position, it checks the parity of the corresponding bits in x and the elements of a. If the parities match, it either skips the bit position or updates the list a by splitting it into sublists based on the parity of the bits at the current position. If the parities do not match, it either skips the bit position or updates the maximum count of sublists with even parity. Finally, the function returns the maximum value between the maximum count of sublists with even parity and the length of the updated list a.
