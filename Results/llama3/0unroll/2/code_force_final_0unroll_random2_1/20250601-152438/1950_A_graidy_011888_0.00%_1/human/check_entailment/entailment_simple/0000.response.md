Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is supposed to read input from stdin, but instead, it generates random numbers and uses them as input. The program also prints the generated numbers along with the result, which is not according to the problem description. The problem description states that the program should read input from stdin and print the result only.

The correct program should read the number of test cases and the three digits for each test case from stdin, and then print the result for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
