Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is 1001, stdin is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates and prints 1000 sets of three random digits (x, y, z) between 1 and 9, and for each set, prints a string indicating whether the sequence forms a 'peak' (y > x and y > z), a 'stair' (y > x and y < z), or 'none' (otherwise).

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
