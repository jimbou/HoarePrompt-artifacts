Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. The problem statement requires the program to read input from the user, but the provided program generates random numbers instead of reading input. The program also prints the generated numbers along with the result, which is not required by the problem statement. Furthermore, the program does not handle the case where the input numbers are 0, which is a valid input according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
