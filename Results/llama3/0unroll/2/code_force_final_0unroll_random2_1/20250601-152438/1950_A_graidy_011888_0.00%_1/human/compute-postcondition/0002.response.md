Output State: **i is 1001, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the variable `i` has been incremented to 1001, indicating that the loop has executed 1000 times. The stdin (standard input) is empty, as all the input lines have been consumed by the loop. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `res` are not relevant in the output state, as they are local to the loop and do not affect the state of the program outside the loop.
