Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing three values: a boolean value indicating whether the length of s1 is greater than or equal to n times k, a substring of s1 starting from the index r times k to the end, and an empty string s2.**

Here's a breakdown of each value in the returned tuple:

1. `len(s1) >= n * k`: This is a boolean value that checks if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`. Since `s1` is a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times, its length is indeed `n * k`. Therefore, this boolean value is `True`.

2. `s1[r * k:]`: This is a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end. Since `r` is equal to `n`, this substring starts from the index `n * k`, which is the end of the string `s1`. Therefore, this substring is an empty string.

3. `s2`: This is an empty string, as given in the initial state.

So, the program returns a tuple containing the values `True`, an empty string, and an empty string.
