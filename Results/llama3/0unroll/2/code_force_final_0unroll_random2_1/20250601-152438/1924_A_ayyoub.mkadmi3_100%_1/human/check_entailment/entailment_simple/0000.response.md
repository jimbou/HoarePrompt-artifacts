Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of checking whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of a given string s. If the answer is NO, it also needs to print a string of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s.

The program uses a function func_1 to process the string s and the integers k and n. The function iterates over the string s, removing characters from the set alphabet as they are encountered. When the set alphabet is empty, it is reset to the original set of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the length of the string s1 is greater than or equal to n times k, a substring of s1, and an empty string s2.

The main part of the program iterates over the test cases, calling the function func_1 for each test case. If the returned boolean value is False, it means that not all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s. In this case, the program finds the first character in the alphabet that is not in the string s1 and appends it to the string s2 to form a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s. If the returned boolean value is True, it means that all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s, and the program prints "Yes".

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
