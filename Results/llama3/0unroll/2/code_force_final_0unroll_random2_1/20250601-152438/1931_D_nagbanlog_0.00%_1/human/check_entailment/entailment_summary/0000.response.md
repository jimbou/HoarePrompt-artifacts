Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the problem description. The program uses a frequency dictionary to store the count of numbers with specific remainders when divided by x and y. It then iterates through the array, calculates the required remainder for each number, and checks if the required remainder is present in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it increments the beautiful pairs count. The program also handles the case where the required remainder is the same as the current number's remainder when divided by x.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. The execution summary also confirms that the program is working as expected, processing each test case and returning the correct count of beautiful pairs.

Correctness: **True**
