Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of lists, where each inner list contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, and 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The length of `test_cases` is equal to `t`. `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, which is a positive integer. The `test_cases` list also remains unchanged, containing lists of lists with specific constraints on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a_i`. The length of `test_cases` is still equal to `t`. A new variable `results` is introduced, which is an empty list.
