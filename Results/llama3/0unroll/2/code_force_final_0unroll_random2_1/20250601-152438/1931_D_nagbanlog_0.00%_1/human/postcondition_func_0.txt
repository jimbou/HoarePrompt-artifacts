This function takes as input a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`, where each test case contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It processes each test case, counting the number of "beautiful pairs" in the list of integers, where a beautiful pair is defined as two numbers that have the same remainder when divided by `y` and have remainders that add up to `x` when divided by `x`. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. The input values `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
