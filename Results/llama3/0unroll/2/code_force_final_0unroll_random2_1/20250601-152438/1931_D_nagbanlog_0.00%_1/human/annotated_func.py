#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of lists, where each inner list contains three integers n, x, and y, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The length of test_cases is equal to t.
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']

    #State: Output State: The value of `results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

    #The program returns a list of t integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. The values of t and test_cases remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes as input a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`, where each test case contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It processes each test case, counting the number of "beautiful pairs" in the list of integers, where a beautiful pair is defined as two numbers that have the same remainder when divided by `y` and have remainders that add up to `x` when divided by `x`. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. The input values `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
