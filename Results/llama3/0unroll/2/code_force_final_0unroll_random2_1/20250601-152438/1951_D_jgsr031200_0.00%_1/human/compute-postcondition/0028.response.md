Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to reach a target value `k` by subtracting two specific costs from a given value `n`. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and the cost 1 twice. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the maximum number of times each cost can be subtracted from `n` without exceeding `k`, and prints 'YES' along with the costs if the total number of subtractions is greater than or equal to `k`, or 'NO' otherwise.**
