Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Bob to set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program uses a greedy approach to try to find a solution.

The program first checks if n is equal to k, in which case it prints 'YES' and the cost 1 twice. This is because if n is equal to k, Alice can buy exactly k jewels at a cost of 1 per jewel.

If n is less than k, the program prints 'NO', because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels if she doesn't have enough coins.

If n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the maximum number of times each cost can be subtracted from n without exceeding k. It does this by dividing n by each cost and adding the result to a running total h. If h is less than k, the program prints 'NO', because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels with the given costs. If h is greater than or equal to k, the program prints 'YES' along with the costs.

However, the program has a logical error. The program only considers two costs: n - k + 1 and 1. This is not sufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly k jewels. For example, if n is 10 and k is 3, the program will print 'YES' and the costs 8 and 1. However, if the costs are 8 and 1, Alice will buy 1 jewel at a cost of 8 and 1 jewel at a cost of 1, for a total of 2 jewels, not 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
