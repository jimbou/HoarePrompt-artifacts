Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to reach a target value `k` by subtracting two specific costs from a given value `n`. The program handles all possible cases:

1. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and the cost 1 twice, which is a valid solution.
2. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO', which is correct because it is impossible to reach `k` by subtracting costs from `n` if `n` is already less than `k`.
3. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the maximum number of times each cost can be subtracted from `n` without exceeding `k`, and prints 'YES' along with the costs if the total number of subtractions is greater than or equal to `k`, or 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible input cases.

Correctness: **True**
