You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers.
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty, and the current state of the program is that 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed twice, and n and k are equal positive integers.
    #State: n and k are positive integers, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being a positive integer less than k, and 'NO' is still being printed.
    #State: n and k are positive integers, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n + k - 1.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: -k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer)
    #State: n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n + k - 1. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed and the current value of h is -1 + k. If h is larger than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, and the elements of the costs list which are -k+1 and 1 are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty, and the current state of the program is that 'YES' has been printed, 1 has been printed twice, and n and k are equal positive integers.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged, with n being a positive integer less than k, and 'NO' is still being printed.

Case_3: n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two integers: 1 and 1, h is -1 + k. The current value of h is lower than k, and 'NO' is being printed

Case_4: n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n + k - 1, and h is larger than or equal to k, and 'YES' is being printed, and the elements of the costs list which are -k+1 and 1 are being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
