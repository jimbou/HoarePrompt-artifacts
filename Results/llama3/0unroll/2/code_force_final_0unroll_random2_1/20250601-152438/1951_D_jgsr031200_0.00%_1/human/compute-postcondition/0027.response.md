Postcondition: **n is 0, k is a positive integer, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n + k - 1. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed and the current value of h is -1 + k. If h is larger than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, and the elements of the costs list which are -k+1 and 1 are printed.**
