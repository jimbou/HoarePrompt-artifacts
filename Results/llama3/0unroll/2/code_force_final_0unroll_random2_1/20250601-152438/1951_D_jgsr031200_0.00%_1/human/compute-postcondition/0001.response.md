Based on the precondition, the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the print statement simply prints the string 'YES', without referencing `n` or `k` in any way.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'YES', regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **YES**
