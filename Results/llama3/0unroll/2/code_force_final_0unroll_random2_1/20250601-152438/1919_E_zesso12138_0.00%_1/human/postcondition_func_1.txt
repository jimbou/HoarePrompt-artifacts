The function reads input data from standard input, extracts a series of test cases, and for each test case, it extracts a positive integer n and a sorted list of integers p of length n. It then calls another function, func_1, with n and p as arguments, and appends the result to a list of results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list.
