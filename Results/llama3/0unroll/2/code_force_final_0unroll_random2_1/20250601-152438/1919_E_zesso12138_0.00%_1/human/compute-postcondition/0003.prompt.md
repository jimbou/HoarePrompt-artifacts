Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n is the last integer value extracted from the data list, p is the last list of integers of length n extracted from the data list, t remains unchanged, index is incremented by the total number of integers extracted from the data list plus the number of times the loop iterated, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for each iteration, and data remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for res in results:
    print(res)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
