You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and p is a list of integers of length n, sorted in non-decreasing order, such that the absolute value of each element in p is less than or equal to n.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n is the last integer value extracted from the data list, p is the last list of integers of length n extracted from the data list, t remains unchanged, index is incremented by the total number of integers extracted from the data list plus the number of times the loop iterated, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for each iteration, and data remains unchanged.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n remains unchanged, p remains unchanged, t remains unchanged, index remains unchanged, results remains unchanged, and data remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
