This function calculates the value at a specific index in a list of integers, where the index is determined by the sum of the last element of a given list of prefix sums and an offset. The list of integers is computed through a dynamic programming process, where each element represents the number of ways to reach a certain state. The function returns the value at the calculated index, which represents the number of ways to reach a specific state.
