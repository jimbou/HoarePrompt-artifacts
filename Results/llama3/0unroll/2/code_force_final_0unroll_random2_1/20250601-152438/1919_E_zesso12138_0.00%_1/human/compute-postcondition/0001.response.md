Output State: **The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n is the last integer value extracted from the data list, p is the last list of integers of length n extracted from the data list, t remains unchanged, index is incremented by the total number of integers extracted from the data list plus the number of times the loop iterated, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for each iteration, and data remains unchanged.**
