#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, p is a list of integers of length n, and MOD is a constant integer (not shown in the function signature but mentioned in the problem description). The integers in p are the prefix sums of a hidden array a of size n, sorted in non-decreasing order.
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: Output State: dp is a list of integers of length 2n + 1 with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[0] and dp[2n] which are both 1.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns the value at index final_sum in the list dp, where final_sum is the sum of the last element of list p and offset, and dp is a list of integers of length 2n + 1 with all elements initialized to 0 except dp[0] and dp[2n] which are both 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the value at a specific index in a list of integers, where the index is determined by the sum of the last element of a given list of prefix sums and an offset. The list of integers is computed through a dynamic programming process, where each element represents the number of ways to reach a certain state. The function returns the value at the calculated index, which represents the number of ways to reach a specific state.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and p is a list of integers of length n, sorted in non-decreasing order, such that the absolute value of each element in p is less than or equal to n.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []

        results.append(result)
        
    #State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n is the last integer value extracted from the data list, p is the last list of integers of length n extracted from the data list, t remains unchanged, index is incremented by the total number of integers extracted from the data list plus the number of times the loop iterated, results is a list containing the results of func_1(n, p) for each iteration, and data remains unchanged.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n remains unchanged, p remains unchanged, t remains unchanged, index remains unchanged, results remains unchanged, and data remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data from standard input, extracts a series of test cases, and for each test case, it extracts a positive integer n and a sorted list of integers p of length n. It then calls another function, func_1, with n and p as arguments, and appends the result to a list of results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list.
