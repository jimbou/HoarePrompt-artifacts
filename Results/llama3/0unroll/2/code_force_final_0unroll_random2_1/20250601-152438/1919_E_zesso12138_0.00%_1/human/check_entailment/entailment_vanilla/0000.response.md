Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of initial arrays `a` such that the prefix sum array `p` after sorting results in the given sorted prefix sum array.

Function 1 (`func_1`) is the core of the solution. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given prefix sum array `p`. The dynamic programming state `dp` is an array of size `2 * n + 1`, where `n` is the size of the hidden array `a`. The state `dp[j]` represents the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in a prefix sum of `j - offset`, where `offset` is `n`.

The function iterates over the prefix sum array `p` from left to right. For each prefix sum `p[i]`, it updates the dynamic programming state `dp` by considering two possibilities:

1.  If the current prefix sum `p[i]` is equal to the previous prefix sum `p[i - 1]`, then the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in `p[i]` is the sum of the number of possible arrays that can result in `p[i - 1] + 1` and `p[i - 1] - 1`. This is because the difference between `p[i]` and `p[i - 1]` can be either `1` or `-1`.
2.  If the current prefix sum `p[i]` is not equal to the previous prefix sum `p[i - 1]`, then the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in `p[i]` is `0`, because there is no way to obtain `p[i]` from `p[i - 1]` by adding or subtracting `1`.

Finally, the function returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last prefix sum `p[-1]` plus the offset `n`. This represents the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given prefix sum array `p`.

Function 2 (`func_2`) is a wrapper function that reads input from the standard input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

Based on the provided problem description and the given program, the program correctly solves the problem.
