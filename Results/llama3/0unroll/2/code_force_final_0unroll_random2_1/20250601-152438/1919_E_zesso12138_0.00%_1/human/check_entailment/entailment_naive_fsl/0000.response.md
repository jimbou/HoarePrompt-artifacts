Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of initial arrays a that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array p.

The program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a dp array of size 2n+1, where n is the size of the hidden array a. The dp array is used to store the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum.

The program then iterates over the prefix sum array p and updates the dp array accordingly. For each prefix sum, it calculates the number of ways to reach the next prefix sum by adding or subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum.

Finally, the program returns the number of ways to reach the final prefix sum, which is the last element of the dp array.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the prefix sum array p contains only 1s or only -1s. It also handles cases where the prefix sum array p contains a mix of 1s and -1s.

The program uses the modulo operator to avoid overflow and ensure that the result is within the range of 998244353.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
