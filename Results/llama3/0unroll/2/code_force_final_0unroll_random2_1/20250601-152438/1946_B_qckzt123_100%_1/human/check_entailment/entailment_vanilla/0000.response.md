Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after k operations, where each operation involves inserting the sum of a contiguous subarray anywhere in the array. The program uses a greedy approach to find the maximum sum.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. Read the number of test cases (T) and iterate over each test case.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array (n) and the number of operations (k).
3. Read the array elements and calculate the sum of the array (s).
4. Initialize two variables, t and tmp, to 0. t will store the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, and tmp will store the current sum of a contiguous subarray.
5. Iterate over the array elements, updating tmp and t as follows:
   - If tmp is less than 0, reset tmp to 0.
   - Update t to be the maximum of t and tmp.
6. Calculate the initial answer (ans) by adding s and t, taking the result modulo MOD (10^9 + 7), and adding MOD to ensure the result is non-negative.
7. For each remaining operation (k - 1), update t by multiplying it by 2, taking the result modulo MOD, and adding it to ans.
8. Print the final answer (ans) modulo MOD.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. The use of a greedy approach to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is optimal, as it ensures that the maximum sum is found in a single pass through the array.

Correctness: **True**
