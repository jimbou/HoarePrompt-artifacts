Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after k operations, where each operation involves inserting the sum of a contiguous subarray anywhere in the array. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result to the console.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first reads the number of test cases (T) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (n) and the number of operations (k), followed by the array elements.

The program calculates the sum of the array elements (s) and the maximum cumulative sum (t) using a single pass through the array. It then calculates the result (ans) by adding the sum of the array and the maximum cumulative sum, taking the result modulo MOD (1000000007) to avoid overflow.

The program then performs k-1 operations, where each operation involves doubling the maximum cumulative sum (t) and adding it to the result (ans), taking the result modulo MOD after each addition.

Finally, the program prints the result for each test case to the console.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
