Output State: **T is an integer equal to the number of test cases, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains T-1 test cases.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the value 1000000007 to the variable MOD. The second line reads an integer from stdin, which represents the number of test cases, and assigns it to the variable T. Since T is now equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains T-1 test cases, as one test case has been read.
