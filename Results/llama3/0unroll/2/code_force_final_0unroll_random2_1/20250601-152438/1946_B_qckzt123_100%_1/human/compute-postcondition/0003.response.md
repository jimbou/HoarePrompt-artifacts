Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates a result for each test case by summing the integers, finding the maximum cumulative sum, and then performing a series of operations involving modular arithmetic. The final result for each test case is printed to the console. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the standard input empty.**
