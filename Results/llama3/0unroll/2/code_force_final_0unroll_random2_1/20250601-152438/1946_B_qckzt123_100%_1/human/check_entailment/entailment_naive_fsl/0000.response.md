Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is 0. In this case, the program should return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7, but the program does not handle this case correctly. It tries to calculate the maximum sum of the array after k operations, but since k is 0, no operations are performed, and the sum of the array remains the same. However, the program does not return the correct result in this case.

For example, if the input is:

1
5 0
4 -2 8 -12 9

The program should return 17, which is the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and returns a different result.
