#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Each test case contains two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D".
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer equal to 0, results is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, stdin is empty.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer equal to 0, results is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, stdin is empty, and the console output contains the results of all test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". It then determines for each test case whether the string can be considered valid based on the conditions that the length of the string is odd and the count of "U" is greater than the count of "D". The function outputs "yes" for valid strings and "no" for invalid strings, printing the results for all test cases to the console.
