Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since the input contains multiple test cases and the first line contains the number of test cases, `t` becomes an integer equal to the number of test cases. The second line creates an empty list and assigns it to `results`. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one line.
