t is a positive integer, cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer. The first list represents array a, the second list represents array b, and the integer represents k. The length of array a is less than or equal to 2*10^5, the length of array b is less than or equal to 2*10^5, and k is less than or equal to 2 times the minimum of the lengths of array a and array b. The integers in array a and array b are between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
