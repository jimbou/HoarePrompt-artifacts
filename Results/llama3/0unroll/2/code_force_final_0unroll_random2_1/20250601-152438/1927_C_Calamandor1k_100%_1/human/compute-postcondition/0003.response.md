Output State: **The program returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions in the loop, which corresponds to the test cases in the 'cases' list, where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer, and the number of test cases is equal to the positive integer 't'.**
