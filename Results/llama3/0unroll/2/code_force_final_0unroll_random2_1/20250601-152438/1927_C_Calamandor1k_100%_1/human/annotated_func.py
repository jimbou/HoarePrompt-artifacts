#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer. The first list represents array a, the second list represents array b, and the integer represents k. The length of array a is less than or equal to 2*10^5, the length of array b is less than or equal to 2*10^5, and k is less than or equal to 2 times the minimum of the lengths of array a and array b. The integers in array a and array b are between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        
        unique_b = set(b)
        
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer, `results` is a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions in the loop.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions in the loop, which corresponds to the test cases in the 'cases' list, where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer, and the number of test cases is equal to the positive integer 't'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether it's possible to select k distinct elements from two lists of integers, a and b, where k is an even integer, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings corresponding to each test case. The function takes a positive integer t and a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing two lists of integers and an even integer k. It checks each test case to see if the number of distinct elements in the union of a and b is at least k, and if the number of elements unique to a or b is not more than k/2. If both conditions are met, it returns 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
