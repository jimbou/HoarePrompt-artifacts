Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it's possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the input and stores it in the `cases` list.
2.  It then defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `cases` as input.
3.  Inside the function, it iterates over each test case and extracts the relevant information: the lengths of the arrays `n` and `m`, the even number `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b` themselves.
4.  It then creates sets of unique elements from `a` and `b` and filters out elements greater than `k`.
5.  It calculates the number of elements that are unique to `a`, unique to `b`, and common to both.
6.  It checks two conditions:

    *   If the number of elements unique to `a` or `b` is more than `k/2`, it returns 'NO' because it's not possible to choose `k/2` elements from both arrays.
    *   If the total number of distinct elements (unique to `a`, unique to `b`, and common to both) is less than `k`, it returns 'NO' because it's not possible to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
7.  If both conditions are met, it returns 'YES', indicating that it's possible to choose `k/2` elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to `k` is included.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
