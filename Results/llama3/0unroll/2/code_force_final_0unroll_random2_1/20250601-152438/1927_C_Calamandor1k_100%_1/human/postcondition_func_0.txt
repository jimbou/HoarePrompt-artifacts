Determines whether it's possible to select k distinct elements from two lists of integers, a and b, where k is an even integer, and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings corresponding to each test case. The function takes a positive integer t and a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing two lists of integers and an even integer k. It checks each test case to see if the number of distinct elements in the union of a and b is at least k, and if the number of elements unique to a or b is not more than k/2. If both conditions are met, it returns 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
