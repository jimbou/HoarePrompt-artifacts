Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included. The program first creates sets of unique elements from both arrays, then filters out elements that are greater than k. It then calculates the number of elements that are only in one array and the number of elements that are in both arrays. If the number of elements that are only in one array is greater than k/2, or if the total number of distinct elements is less than k, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'. This logic is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
