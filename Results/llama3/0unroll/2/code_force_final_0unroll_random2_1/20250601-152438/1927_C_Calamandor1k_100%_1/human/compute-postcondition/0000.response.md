Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `cases` remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `results` and assigned it an empty list. The rest of the information from the initial state is still valid, including the constraints on the lengths and values of the integers in the test cases.
