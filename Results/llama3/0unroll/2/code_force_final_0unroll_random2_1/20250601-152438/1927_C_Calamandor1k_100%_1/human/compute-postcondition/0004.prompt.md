You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer. The first list represents array a, the second list represents array b, and the integer represents k. The length of array a is less than or equal to 2*10^5, the length of array b is less than or equal to 2*10^5, and k is less than or equal to 2 times the minimum of the lengths of array a and array b. The integers in array a and array b are between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        
        unique_b = set(b)
        
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        results.append('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer, `results` is a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions in the loop.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions in the loop, which corresponds to the test cases in the 'cases' list, where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer, and the number of test cases is equal to the positive integer 't'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions in the loop, which corresponds to the test cases in the 'cases' list, where each test case is a tuple of three elements: two lists of integers and an even integer, and the number of test cases is equal to the positive integer 't'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
