t is a non-negative integer, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k, and two lists a and b of integers, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even, 1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6 for all i and j, and the sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4*10^5.
