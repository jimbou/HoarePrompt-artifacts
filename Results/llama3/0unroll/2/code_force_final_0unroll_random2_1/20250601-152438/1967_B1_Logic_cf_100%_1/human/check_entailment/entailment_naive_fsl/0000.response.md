Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This line is trying to count the number of pairs where `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`, but it is not doing so correctly.

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of `b` and for each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` that satisfy the condition `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`. The program is not doing this correctly, it is only considering the case where `a+b` is a multiple of `b*b`, which is not the same as `b * gcd(a,b)`.

For example, when `n=10` and `m=8`, the program outputs `14`, but the correct answer is `17`. The pairs that satisfy the conditions are: `(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2), (10,5), (10,8)`. The program is missing the pairs `(10,5)` and `(10,8)`.
