Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

The program iterates over each test case, reads the values of n and m, and initializes the answer (ans) to n.

The key insight in the program is the observation that for a given value of b, the number of valid pairs (a, b) is equal to the number of multiples of b^2 that are less than or equal to n + b. This is because the condition a + b being a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) is equivalent to a being a multiple of b^2.

The program then iterates over the range of possible values of b (from 2 to min(n, m)) and adds the number of valid pairs for each b to the answer.

Finally, the program prints the total answer for each test case.

Based on the provided execution states, the program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
