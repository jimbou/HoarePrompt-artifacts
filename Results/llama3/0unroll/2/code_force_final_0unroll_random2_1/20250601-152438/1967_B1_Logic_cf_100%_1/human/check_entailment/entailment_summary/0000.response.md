Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of b from 2 to the minimum of n and m, and for each b, it adds the number of multiples of b^2 that are less than or equal to n to the answer. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem statement requires that a+b is a multiple of b*gcd(a,b), which is not equivalent to the condition used in the program. The program's condition is more restrictive and does not cover all possible cases.

For example, consider the case where n = 10 and m = 8. The program will only consider b values up to 8, but the correct solution should also consider b values up to 10. Moreover, the program's calculation of the number of multiples of b^2 is not correct.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
