Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the first test case has been removed from the stdin.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been removed, as it was used to determine the value of `t`. Each remaining test case still contains two positive integers `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
