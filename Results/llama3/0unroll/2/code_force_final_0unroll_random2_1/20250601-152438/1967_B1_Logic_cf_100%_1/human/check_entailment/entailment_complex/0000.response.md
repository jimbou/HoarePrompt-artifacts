Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, and for each `b`, it adds the number of multiples of `b*b` that are less than or equal to `n` to the answer `ans`. This is based on the observation that `a+b` is a multiple of `b*gcd(a,b)` if and only if `a` is a multiple of `b*b`.

However, this approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, and for each `b`, calculate the number of values of `a` that satisfy the condition `a+b` is a multiple of `b*gcd(a,b)`. This can be done by iterating over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` and checking if `a+b` is a multiple of `b*gcd(a,b)`.

The given program is also incorrect because it only considers values of `b` up to the minimum of `n` and `m`, whereas the problem statement allows `b` to be up to `m`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
