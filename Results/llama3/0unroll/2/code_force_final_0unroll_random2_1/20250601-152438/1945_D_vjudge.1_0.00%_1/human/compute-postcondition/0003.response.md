Output State: **`pref` is the sum of the first n-k elements of lista_A and the sum of the elements of lista_B that are greater than the corresponding elements in lista_A, `soma_b` is 0, `resultado` is infinity, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `resultado` has been updated to infinity, while the values of `pref` and `soma_b` remain the same as in the initial state. The rest of the variables also remain unchanged.
