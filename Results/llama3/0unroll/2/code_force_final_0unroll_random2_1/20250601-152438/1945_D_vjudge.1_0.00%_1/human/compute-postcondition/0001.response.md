Output State: **The loop will execute `numero_testes` times, and for each iteration, it will call the function `func_1()` without passing any arguments. The state of the variables `numero_testes`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop. The output state will be the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the function `func_1()` will have been called `numero_testes` times.**
