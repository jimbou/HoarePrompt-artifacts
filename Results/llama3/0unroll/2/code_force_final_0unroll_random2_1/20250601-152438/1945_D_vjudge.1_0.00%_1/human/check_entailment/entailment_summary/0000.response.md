Reasoning: 

The problem requires determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the minimum value that can be obtained by summing the first n-k elements of `lista_A`, the sum of the elements of `lista_B` that are greater than the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, and one of the last k elements of `lista_A`. This function takes as input two positive integers n and k, and two lists of n positive integers `lista_A` and `lista_B`, and returns the minimum value.

`func_2` reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then iterates that many times, calling `func_1` without passing any arguments.

The given program is correct because it meets the problem description. `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend, and `func_2` correctly iterates over the test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
