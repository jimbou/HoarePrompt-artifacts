Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes the input values `n` and `k` (which is equivalent to `m` in the problem description), and two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` (which are equivalent to `a` and `b` in the problem description). It reverses the lists and initializes variables `soma_b` and `pref`. The function then iterates over the first `n-k` elements of the reversed lists, updating `pref` and `soma_b` based on the conditions specified in the problem. After that, it iterates over the last `k` elements of the reversed lists, updating the minimum value `resultado` based on the conditions specified in the problem. Finally, it prints the minimum value `resultado`.

`func_2` reads the number of test cases from the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem, and the output state matches the expected output. The variables are updated correctly, and the minimum value is calculated as specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
