Output State: **`numero_testes` is a positive integer, stdin contains 3 lines for each test case: two integers (n and m) and two lists of integers (a and b) separated by spaces, where n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the lists a and b contain n positive integers each.**

The code assigns the value of the first input (the number of test cases) to the variable `numero_testes`. The stdin now contains the remaining inputs for each test case, which includes two integers (n and m) and two lists of integers (a and b) separated by spaces. The values of n, m, a, and b are not affected by this code, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
