Functionality: **The function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then iterates that many times, calling another function (`func_1`) without passing any arguments. The function does not modify the input variables or produce any output; its sole purpose is to execute `func_1` a specified number of times based on the input.**
