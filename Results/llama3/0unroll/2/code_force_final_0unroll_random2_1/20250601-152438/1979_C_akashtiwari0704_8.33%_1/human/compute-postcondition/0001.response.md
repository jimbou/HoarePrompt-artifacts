Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of lines, each containing either the value -1 or a sequence of integers separated by spaces. The number of lines is equal to the value of `t`. If the sum of the modified integers in a test case is greater than or equal to the product of the original integers, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is a sequence of integers, where each integer is the product of all other integers in the test case divided by the original integer at that position.
