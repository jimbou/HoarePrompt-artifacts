Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing a set of integers. For each test case, it calculates the product of all integers and then modifies each integer by dividing the product by the integer itself. If the sum of these modified integers is greater than or equal to the product, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the sequence of modified integers. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input, producing a series of output lines corresponding to each test case.**
