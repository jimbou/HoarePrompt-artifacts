Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a list of multipliers that are not pairwise coprime. In such cases, the program will produce a sum of bets that is greater than or equal to the product of the multipliers, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

For example, if the input is [2, 2, 2], the program will produce a sum of bets equal to 4, which is not less than the product of the multipliers (2*2*2 = 8). This is because the program calculates the bets as the product of the multipliers divided by each multiplier, which does not take into account the fact that the multipliers are not pairwise coprime.

In this case, the program should output -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and instead produces an incorrect output.
