Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program calculates the product of all multipliers (k_i) for each test case and then modifies each multiplier by dividing the product by the multiplier itself. This effectively calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all multipliers.

The program then checks if the sum of these modified multipliers is greater than or equal to the product. If it is, the program outputs -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, the program outputs the sequence of modified multipliers, which represents the bets on each outcome.

The reasoning behind this approach is that if the sum of the modified multipliers is less than the product, then the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This is because the modified multipliers represent the minimum amount of coins that need to be bet on each outcome to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is less than the number of coins received back.

Therefore, the program is correct in its approach and logic.

Correctness: **True**
