The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line of each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50). 

The `input()` function will read the first line of the first test case, which is an integer `n`. This integer `n` is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function and assigned to the variable `t`.

Therefore, the value of `t` is now equal to the integer `n` from the first test case.

The remaining test cases are still in the stdin, each containing two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` integers `k_1,k_2,...,k_n` (2 <= k_i <= 20).**
