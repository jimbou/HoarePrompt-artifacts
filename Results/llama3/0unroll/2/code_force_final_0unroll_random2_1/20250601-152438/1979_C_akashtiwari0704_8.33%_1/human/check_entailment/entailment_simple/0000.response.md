Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program works by first calculating the product of all multipliers (prod). Then, for each outcome, it calculates the bet amount by dividing the product by the multiplier (a[i] = prod // a[i]). The sum of these bet amounts is calculated (sumo).

If the sum of the bet amounts is greater than or equal to the product, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the sequence of bet amounts.

The reasoning behind this approach is correct. By dividing the product by each multiplier, we are essentially finding the maximum amount that can be bet on each outcome without exceeding the product. If the sum of these amounts is still greater than or equal to the product, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
