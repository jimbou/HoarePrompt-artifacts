Output State: **The output state will be a series of lines, each containing either -1 or a sequence of integers separated by spaces. The number of lines will be equal to the value of t. For each test case, if the sum of the modified integers (each integer divided by the product of all integers) is greater than or equal to the product of all integers, the output will be -1. Otherwise, the output will be a sequence of modified integers, each representing the result of dividing the product of all integers by the respective integer.**
