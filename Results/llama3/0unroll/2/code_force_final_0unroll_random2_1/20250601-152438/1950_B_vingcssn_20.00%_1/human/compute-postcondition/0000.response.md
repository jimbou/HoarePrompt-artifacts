The code `casos = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) followed by t lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). Since the first integer t is assigned to `casos`, the remaining input in stdin will be t lines each containing an integer n.

Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos` lines each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20)**
