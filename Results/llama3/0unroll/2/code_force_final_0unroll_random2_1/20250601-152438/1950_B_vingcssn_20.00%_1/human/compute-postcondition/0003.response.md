Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the size of a pattern to be printed. For each pattern size between 1 and 4, it prints a specific pattern of '#' and '.' characters, with '#' forming a border around the pattern and '.' filling the inside. If the pattern size is not between 1 and 4, it prints the message "No esta en el rango". The function prints a concatenation of these patterns for each input integer.**
