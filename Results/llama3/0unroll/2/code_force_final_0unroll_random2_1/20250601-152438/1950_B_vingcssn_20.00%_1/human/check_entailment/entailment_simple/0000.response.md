Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for all values of n. The program only handles specific cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and for any other value of n, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish). However, the problem statement requires the program to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n between 1 and 20.

The program does not have a general algorithm to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n. It only has hardcoded solutions for specific values of n. This means that the program will not work correctly for values of n that are not 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Correctness: **False**
