Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It only handles the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and for any other value of n, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish). However, the problem description states that n can be any integer between 1 and 20.

For example, if the input is 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango" instead of the correct checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
