Output State: The output state will be a series of printed patterns based on the input integers. For each input integer n, a specific pattern of '#' and '.' characters will be printed. The pattern will have a size of n x n, with '#' characters forming a border around the pattern and '.' characters filling the inside. The exact pattern will depend on the value of n. If n is not between 1 and 4 (inclusive), the message "No esta en el rango" will be printed. The output will be a concatenation of these patterns for each input integer.
