Output State: The output state will be a series of printed patterns based on the input integers. For each input integer n, a specific pattern of '#' and '.' characters will be printed, with the pattern depending on the value of n. The patterns will be printed in the format specified in the code, with each pattern consisting of multiple lines of '#' and '.' characters. The output will not include any values of n that are outside the range of 1 to 4, as the code prints 'No esta en el rango' for such values.
