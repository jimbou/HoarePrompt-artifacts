Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. The problem statement requires the program to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard made of 2 x 2 squares alternating '#' and '.' characters, with the top-left cell being '#'. However, the program only handles cases where n is between 1 and 4 (inclusive) and prints a fixed pattern for each of these cases. It does not handle cases where n is greater than 4 or less than 1, and it does not generate the checkerboard pattern correctly for any value of n.

The program's logic is also incorrect. It uses a series of if-elif statements to handle different values of n, but this approach is not scalable and will not work for larger values of n. A correct solution would use a loop to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n.

Correctness: **False**
