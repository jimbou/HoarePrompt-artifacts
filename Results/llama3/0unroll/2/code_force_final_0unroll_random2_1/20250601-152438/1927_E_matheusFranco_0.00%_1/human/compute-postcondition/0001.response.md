Output State: `t` equals 0.



The output state is that the variable `t` has been decremented to 0 after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `t` has been reduced by 1 in each iteration until it reached 0, at which point the loop condition `t > 0` is no longer true, causing the loop to terminate.
