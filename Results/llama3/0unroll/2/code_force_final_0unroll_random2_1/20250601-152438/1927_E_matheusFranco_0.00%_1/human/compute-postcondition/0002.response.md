Output State: `t` is 0, stdin contains no input.



The output state is that the variable `t` has been decremented to 0, and the stdin remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. The function `func_1()` was executed `t` times, but since its effects are not specified, we cannot determine any further changes to the state.
