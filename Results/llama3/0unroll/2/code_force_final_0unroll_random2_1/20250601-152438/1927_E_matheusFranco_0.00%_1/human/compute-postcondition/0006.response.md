Functionality: **This function generates a permutation of length n, where the first k non-zero values are assigned in a specific pattern, and prints the resulting permutation as a string of space-separated values. The function takes two integers n and k as input from stdin, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and leaves the input variables unchanged. The output string contains k non-zero values separated by spaces.**
