Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a k-level permutation of length n. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

Function func_1 takes the input values n and k, and constructs a k-level permutation of length n. It initializes an array permutation of size n with all elements set to 0. It then iterates over the range of k, and for each i in this range, it calculates the multiples of k plus i. For each multiple, it assigns the current value curr_v to the permutation array at that index, and increments curr_v. This process ensures that the permutation array is filled with values from 1 to n in a way that satisfies the condition of a k-level permutation.

Function func_2 reads the number of test cases t from the input, and then calls func_1 for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of while loops and the calculation of multiples of k plus i are efficient and effective in constructing the k-level permutation.

Correctness: **True**
