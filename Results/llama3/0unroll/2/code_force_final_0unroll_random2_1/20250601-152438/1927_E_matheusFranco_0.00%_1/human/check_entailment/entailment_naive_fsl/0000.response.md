Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program is designed to generate a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is a permutation where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The program uses a clever approach to construct the permutation. It initializes an array of length n with zeros and then fills it in a specific order. The idea is to place the numbers in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length k are as balanced as possible.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the input n and k, constructs the permutation, and prints it. `func_2` reads the number of test cases t and calls `func_1` t times.

The key insight in the program is the way it fills the permutation array. It uses a variable `idx` to keep track of the current index and `idx_v` to keep track of the current value to be placed. It also uses a variable `curr_v` to keep track of the current value being placed.

The program places the numbers in a way that the sums of continuous segments of length k are as balanced as possible. It does this by placing the numbers in a cyclic manner, starting from the first index and moving to the next index that is k positions ahead.

I have analyzed the program and could not find any potential case where it does not work correctly. The program correctly handles the constraints that k is even and k â‰¤ n. It also correctly constructs the permutation and prints it.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
