Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function `func_1` generates a permutation of length n, where the first k non-zero values are assigned in a specific pattern. The pattern is such that the first k values are assigned in a cyclic manner, with each cycle starting from a multiple of k. This ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k are as evenly distributed as possible.

Function `func_2` reads an integer from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. It then executes `func_1` a number of times equal to the initial integer value.

Since `func_1` generates a k-level permutation of length n, and `func_2` executes `func_1` the correct number of times, the program as a whole meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
