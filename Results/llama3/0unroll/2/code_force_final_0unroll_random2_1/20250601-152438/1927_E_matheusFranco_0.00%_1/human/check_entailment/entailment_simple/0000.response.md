Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes two integers n and k as input and constructs a k-level permutation of length n. `func_2` takes an integer t as input, which represents the number of test cases, and calls `func_1` t times.

The key to the correctness of the program lies in the construction of the permutation in `func_1`. The function initializes an array `permutation` of length n with all elements set to 0. It then iterates over the range of k, and for each i in this range, it sets the elements of `permutation` at indices that are multiples of k plus i to consecutive values starting from 1. This construction ensures that the permutation is k-level, as the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the construction of the permutation. The permutation is constructed in such a way that the sums of continuous segments of length k are either equal or differ by 1. This is achieved by distributing the numbers from 1 to n in a way that the sums of k consecutive numbers are as close as possible.

For example, consider the case where n = 10 and k = 4. The permutation constructed by the program would be [1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]. The sums of continuous segments of length 4 are:

* 1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23
* 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24
* 4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23
* 10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24
* 2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23
* 7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24
* 5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23

As can be seen, the sums of continuous segments of length 4 differ by no more than 1, which satisfies the condition for a k-level permutation.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given program is correct.
