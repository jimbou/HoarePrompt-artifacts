You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t (n >= 2, t = 1), then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= n), and finally one integer u_1 (1 <= u_1 <= n).
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: The variable t remains 1, the variable empty is False, the variable n remains unchanged, and the deque tree contains a sequence of integers representing a path in a tree, where each pair of adjacent integers in the sequence represents an edge in the tree. The sequence starts with the integer u_1, and each subsequent integer is either the left or right child of the previous integer in the tree.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: The variables t, empty, n, start, idx, and moves retain their initial values, and the deque tree remains unchanged. The sequence in the deque tree still represents a path in a tree, where each pair of adjacent integers represents an edge in the tree. If at least one of the integers in the moves list is odd, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in the moves list are even, and 'Hermione' is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The variable t remains 1, the variable empty is False, the variable n remains unchanged, the variable start is an integer, the variable idx is an integer equal to the index of start in the tree, the variable moves is a list containing two integers, the first integer is the minimum of t and idx, and the second integer is the minimum of t and n - idx - 1, and the deque tree contains a sequence of integers representing a path in a tree, where each pair of adjacent integers in the sequence represents an edge in the tree. The sequence starts with the integer u_1, and each subsequent integer is either the left or right child of the previous integer in the tree. Stdin contains 0 inputs. The current value of at least one of the integers in the moves list is odd, and 'Ron' is printed

Case_2: The variable t remains 1, the variable empty is False, the variable n remains unchanged, the variable start is an integer, the variable idx is an integer equal to the index of start in the tree, the variable moves is a list containing two integers, the first integer is the minimum of t and idx, and the second integer is the minimum of t and n - idx - 1, and the deque tree contains a sequence of integers representing a path in a tree, where each pair of adjacent integers in the sequence represents an edge in the tree. The sequence starts with the integer u_1, and each subsequent integer is either the left or right child of the previous integer in the tree. Stdin contains 0 inputs. Additionally, all elements in the list moves are even, and 'Hermione' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
