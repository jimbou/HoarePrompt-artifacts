Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, constructs a tree path from the input, and determines whether a sequence of moves is possible. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints 'Ron' if at least one move in the sequence is odd, and 'Hermione' if all moves are even. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking.**
