Output State: The variable t remains 1, the variable empty is False, the variable n remains unchanged, and the deque tree contains a sequence of integers representing a path in a tree, where each pair of adjacent integers in the sequence represents an edge in the tree. The sequence starts with the integer u_1, and each subsequent integer is either the left or right child of the previous integer in the tree.
