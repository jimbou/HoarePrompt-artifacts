Postcondition: **The variables t, empty, n, start, idx, and moves retain their initial values, and the deque tree remains unchanged. The sequence in the deque tree still represents a path in a tree, where each pair of adjacent integers represents an edge in the tree. If at least one of the integers in the moves list is odd, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in the moves list are even, and 'Hermione' is printed.**
