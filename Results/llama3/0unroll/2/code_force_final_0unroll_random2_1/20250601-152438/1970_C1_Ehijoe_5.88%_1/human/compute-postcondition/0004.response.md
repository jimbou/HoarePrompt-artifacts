Postcondition: ***The variable t remains 1, the variable empty is False, the variable n remains unchanged, the variable start is an integer, the variable idx is an integer equal to the index of start in the tree, the variable moves is a list containing two integers, the first integer is the minimum of t and idx, and the second integer is the minimum of t and n - idx - 1, and the deque tree contains a sequence of integers representing a path in a tree, where each pair of adjacent integers in the sequence represents an edge in the tree. The sequence starts with the integer u_1, and each subsequent integer is either the left or right child of the previous integer in the tree. Stdin contains 0 inputs. The current value of at least one of the integers in the moves list is odd.***
