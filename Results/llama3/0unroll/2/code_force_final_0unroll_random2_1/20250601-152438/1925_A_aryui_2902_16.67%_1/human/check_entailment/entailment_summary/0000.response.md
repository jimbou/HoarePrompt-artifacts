Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly generates a string consisting of the first k characters of the alphabet, repeated n times, where k and n are integers between 1 and 26 inclusive. This string satisfies the condition that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the generated string. The program also handles the constraints of the problem correctly, including the range of inputs for n and k.

Correctness: **True**
