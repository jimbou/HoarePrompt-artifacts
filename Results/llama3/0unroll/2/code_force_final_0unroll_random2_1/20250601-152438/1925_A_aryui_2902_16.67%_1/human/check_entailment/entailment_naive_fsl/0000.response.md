Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 2 and k = 2, the program returns "abab", but the correct answer is "baab". The program is not correctly implementing the logic to find the smallest string that contains all possible substrings of length n formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets.

The program is simply repeating the first k characters n times, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem. The correct approach would be to find a string that contains all possible substrings of length n, which can be achieved by using a different logic.

For instance, when n = 2 and k = 2, the correct answer "baab" contains all possible substrings of length 2 formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, which are "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". The program's output "abab" does not contain all these substrings.
