Output State: **stdin contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) denoting the number of test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and 26 inclusive, s is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'**

The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input, which originally contains `t` test cases. After reading `n` and `k`, the standard input will have `t-1` test cases left. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input values, which are between 1 and 26 inclusive. The string `s` is assigned a fixed value 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw', which is not affected by the input values.
