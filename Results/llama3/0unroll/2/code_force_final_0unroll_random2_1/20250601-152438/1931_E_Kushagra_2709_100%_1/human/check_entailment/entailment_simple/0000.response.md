Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

The program first calculates the total sum of the lengths of the string representations of the integers in the list `nums`. Then, it calculates the sum of the counts of zeros in the string representations of the integers in `nums` at even indices. This is done by calling the function `zerocnts` for each integer in `nums` and summing up the results at even indices.

The program then compares the total sum minus the sum of zeros at even indices with `m + 1`. If the result is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it returns 'Sasha', indicating that Sasha wins. Otherwise, it returns 'Anna', indicating that Anna wins.

The function `zerocnts` correctly calculates the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of a non-negative integer. It iterates over the string from right to left and increments the count until it encounters a non-zero digit.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
