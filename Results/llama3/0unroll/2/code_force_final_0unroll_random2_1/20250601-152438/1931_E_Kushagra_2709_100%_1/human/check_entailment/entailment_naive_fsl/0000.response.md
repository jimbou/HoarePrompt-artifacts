Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function calculates the total number of digits in the list of numbers and then subtracts the number of trailing zeros in the numbers, considering Anna's optimal moves. The `zerocnts` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the total number of digits and the parameter `m`. If the total number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and scenarios, including edge cases such as a single number in the list or a list with only one element.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs and scenarios.
