    #The program returns either 'Sasha' or 'Anna'. If the total sum of the lengths of the string representations of the integers in 'nums' minus the sum of the counts of zeros in the string representations of the integers in 'nums' at even indices is greater than or equal to 'm + 1', then 'Sasha' is returned. Otherwise, 'Anna' is returned.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner of a game based on the total sum of the lengths of the string representations of a list of integers minus the sum of the counts of zeros in the string representations of the integers at even indices, and a given non-negative integer threshold. Returns 'Sasha' if the total sum is greater than or equal to the threshold plus one, otherwise returns 'Anna'.

    return tot
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string 'num' that represents a non-negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-negative integer as input, converts it to a string, and returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the input integer.
