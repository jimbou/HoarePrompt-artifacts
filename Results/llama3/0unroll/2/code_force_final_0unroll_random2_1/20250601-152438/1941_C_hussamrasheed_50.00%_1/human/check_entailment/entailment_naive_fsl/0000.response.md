Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where the string "map" and "pie" overlap. For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate occurrences of "map" and "pie", but in reality, it's only one occurrence of the substring "mapie". The program should handle such cases correctly.

In the given program, the line `s = s.replace('map', '')` removes all occurrences of "map" from the string, but it does not account for the fact that some of these occurrences might be part of a larger substring "mapie". As a result, the program will incorrectly count the number of occurrences of "pie" in the modified string.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to handle overlapping substrings correctly. One possible approach is to use a more sophisticated string searching algorithm that can handle overlapping matches.
