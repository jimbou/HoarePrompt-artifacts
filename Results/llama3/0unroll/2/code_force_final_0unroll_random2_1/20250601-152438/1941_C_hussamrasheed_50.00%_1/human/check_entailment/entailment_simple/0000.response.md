Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the input string s, and prints the sum of these counts as the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program first reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, it reads the length of the string n and the string s itself. It then counts the occurrences of 'map' in s using the count() method, replaces all occurrences of 'map' with an empty string using the replace() method, and then counts the occurrences of 'pie' in the modified string s. Finally, it prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' as the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

The program correctly handles the case where the string s is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'map' or 'pie'), in which case it prints 0.

The program also correctly handles the case where the string s contains multiple occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', and correctly counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
