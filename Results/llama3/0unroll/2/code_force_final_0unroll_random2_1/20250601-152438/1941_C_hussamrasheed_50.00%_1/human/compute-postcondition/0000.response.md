The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since stdin contains t test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer and is assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in stdin. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^6), stdin contains (t-1) test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
