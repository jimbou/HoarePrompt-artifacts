Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the string (which is not used in the program) and the string itself. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string, and prints the sum of these counts. This is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, as required by the problem.

The program correctly handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'map' or 'pie') by printing 0.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and printing the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
