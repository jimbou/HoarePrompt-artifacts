Output State: **The loop has executed t times, and for each execution, it has read an integer n and a string s from stdin, counted the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in s, and printed the sum of these counts. The values of t, n, s, m, and p have been updated accordingly after each execution. The final state is that t has been decremented to 0, and the last values of n, s, m, and p are stored in memory.**
