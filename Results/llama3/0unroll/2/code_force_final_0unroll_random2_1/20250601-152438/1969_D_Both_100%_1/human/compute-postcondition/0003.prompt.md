You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_4() is called after the functions func_1() and func_2() have been executed and returned their values. The function func_3() is also defined and can be called. The function heapq.heappushpop() is also defined and can be called.
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())

            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: Output State: The function func_1() has been executed and returned its value, which is assigned to the variable test_cases. The functions func_2() and func_3() are still defined and can be called. The function heapq.heappushpop() is also still defined and can be called. The loop has executed all the iterations and the variable max_profit has been updated with the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling items in the given test cases. The variables heap, remaining_items, n, k, prices, neg_prices, bonuses, combined, and current_profit have been updated with their respective values after the last iteration of the loop.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
