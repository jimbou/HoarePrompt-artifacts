#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(read_input())
    #The program returns an integer greater than 0 that was provided as input through stdin.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer greater than 0 from standard input and returns it as an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: read_input() returns a string of space-separated integers.
    return map(int, read_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a result of converting a string of space-separated integers returned by read_input() into an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and returns a map object containing a sequence of integers. The integers are the result of converting a string of space-separated integers into individual integers. The function does not modify any input variables, as it does not accept any. The final state of the program is that it returns a map object with the converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items and secondary_heap are lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents an item's price for Alice (first element) and Bob (second element).
    total = sum(item[0] for item in secondary_heap)
    for item in primary_items:
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            total += item[0] + item[1]
        
    #State: Output State: `primary_items` is a list of pairs of integers, `secondary_heap` is a list of pairs of integers, `total` is the sum of the prices of Alice for all items in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the prices of the items in `primary_items` that have a total price greater than or equal to 0.
    return total
    #The program returns the sum of the prices of Alice for all items in `secondary_heap` plus the sum of the prices of the items in `primary_items` that have a total price greater than or equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the total price of items for Alice, considering all items in the secondary heap and only items in the primary list with a combined price greater than or equal to 0, returning this total price.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function func_4() is called after the functions func_1() and func_2() have been executed and returned their values. The function func_3() is also defined and can be called. The function heapq.heappushpop() is also defined and can be called.

            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]

    #State: Output State: The function func_1() has been executed and returned its value, which is assigned to the variable test_cases. The functions func_2() and func_3() are still defined and can be called. The function heapq.heappushpop() is also still defined and can be called. The loop has executed all the iterations and the variable max_profit has been updated with the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling items in the given test cases. The variables heap, remaining_items, n, k, prices, neg_prices, bonuses, combined, and current_profit have been updated with their respective values after the last iteration of the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling items in a series of test cases. It takes no input parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the maximum profit for each test case. The function iterates over a number of test cases, and for each test case, it generates a list of prices and bonuses, sorts them based on the bonuses, and then simulates a process of buying and selling items to maximize the profit. The function uses a heap data structure to keep track of the items with the highest bonuses and updates the maximum profit as it iterates over the items.
