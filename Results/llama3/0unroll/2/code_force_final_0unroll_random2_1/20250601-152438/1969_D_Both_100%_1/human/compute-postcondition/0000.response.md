Output State: **The function func_1() has been executed and returned its value, which is assigned to the variable test_cases. The functions func_2() and func_3() are still defined and can be called. The function heapq.heappushpop() is also still defined and can be called.**

In this output state, the value of test_cases is the return value of func_1(), which is unknown since the code for func_1() is not provided. The other functions, func_2(), func_3(), and heapq.heappushpop(), remain unchanged and can still be called.
