This function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling items in a series of test cases. It takes no input parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the maximum profit for each test case. The function iterates over a number of test cases, and for each test case, it generates a list of prices and bonuses, sorts them based on the bonuses, and then simulates a process of buying and selling items to maximize the profit. The function uses a heap data structure to keep track of the items with the highest bonuses and updates the maximum profit as it iterates over the items.
