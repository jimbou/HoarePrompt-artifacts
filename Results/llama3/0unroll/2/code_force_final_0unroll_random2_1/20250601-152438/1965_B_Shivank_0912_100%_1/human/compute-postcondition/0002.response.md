Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts two inputs: an integer t and t pairs of integers n and k. For each pair of n and k, it generates a sequence of 21 integers, replacing the number at a specific index with three numbers derived from k, and prints the length and the sequence. The function performs this operation t times, producing t sequences of integers as output.**
