Output State: **The output state will contain `t` number of lines, each containing a sequence of integers. Each sequence will have a length of 21 and will contain the numbers from 1 to 20, with the number at index `i` being replaced by three numbers: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. The value of `i` is determined by the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. The remaining numbers in the sequence will be powers of 2 from 1 to 20, excluding the number at index `i`.**
