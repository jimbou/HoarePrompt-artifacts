The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer `t` first and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k` first. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n**
