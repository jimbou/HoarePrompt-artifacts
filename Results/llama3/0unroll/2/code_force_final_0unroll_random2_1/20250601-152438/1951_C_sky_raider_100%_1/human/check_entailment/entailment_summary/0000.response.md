Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `n` integers representing the prices of tickets for each day.
2.  It sorts the prices of tickets in ascending order, which is a crucial step in finding the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets.
3.  The program then iterates through the sorted prices, calculating the total spending by adding the product of the minimum of `m` and `k`, and the sum of the current price and the total spending so far.
4.  In each iteration, the program updates the total spending and subtracts the minimum of `m` and `k` from `k`, effectively keeping track of the remaining tickets to be purchased.
5.  Finally, the program prints the integer value of the total spending for each test case.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The variable `t` is used to keep track of the total tickets purchased so far, but it is not correctly updated. The correct update should be `t += min(m, k)`, not `t += s`. Also, the variable `s` is not necessary and can be removed.

Correctness: **False**
