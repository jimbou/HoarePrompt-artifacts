This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers, then iterates through them, calculating a total sum by adding the product of the minimum of m and k, and the sum of the current integer and the total sum so far. The total sum is updated and the minimum of m and k is subtracted from k in each iteration. Finally, the function prints the integer value of the total sum for each test case.
