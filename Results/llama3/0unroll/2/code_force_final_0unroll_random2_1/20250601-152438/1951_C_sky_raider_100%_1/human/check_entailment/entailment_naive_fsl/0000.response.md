Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The problem description states that the price per ticket for each day is increased by the number of tickets purchased on that day, but the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and then purchases the minimum number of tickets on each day, without considering the effect of the price increase on the subsequent days.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices and purchase 2 tickets on the first day (price 8), 1 ticket on the second day (price 6), and 0 tickets on the third and fourth days. However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to purchase 1 ticket on the first day (price 8), 1 ticket on the second day (price 6), and 1 ticket on the third day (price 4), which would result in a lower total cost.

The program does not consider the dynamic nature of the problem, where the price increase on one day affects the prices on subsequent days. Therefore, it is incorrect.
