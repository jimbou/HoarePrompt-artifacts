Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then iterating through the sorted list. In each iteration, it calculates the minimum number of tickets that can be purchased on the current day (either the maximum allowed per day `m` or the remaining number of tickets to be purchased `k`, whichever is smaller). It then adds the cost of purchasing these tickets to the total cost `c`, increments the total number of tickets purchased `t` by the number of tickets purchased on the current day, and decrements the remaining number of tickets to be purchased `k` by the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The program is sorting the list of ticket prices, which is not necessary. The problem statement does not require the ticket prices to be sorted.
2. The program is using the variable `t` to keep track of the total number of tickets purchased, but it is not using this variable correctly. The variable `t` should be used to keep track of the total number of tickets purchased so far, not the total number of tickets purchased on the current day.
3. The program is not correctly calculating the cost of purchasing tickets on each day. The cost of purchasing tickets on each day should be the price of the ticket on that day plus the total number of tickets purchased so far.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
            if k == 0:
                break
        print(int(c))
```

Correctness: **False**
