Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the sum of the products of the minimum of m and k, and the sum of the current element in the list and the total sum so far, for each element in the sorted list. The total sum is updated by adding the product of the minimum of m and k, and the current element in the list, and the minimum of m and k is subtracted from k. The output is the integer value of the total sum.**
