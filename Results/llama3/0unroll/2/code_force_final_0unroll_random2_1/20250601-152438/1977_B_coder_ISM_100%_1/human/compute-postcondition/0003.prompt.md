You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 <= x < 2^30).
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        
        s = []
        
        length = 30
        
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')

            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        
        print(length)
        
        print(*s)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be the number of test cases (t) followed by the modified binary representation of each test case. The binary representation will have the following properties: 
    #- If two consecutive bits are '1', the first bit will be changed to '-1' and the second bit will be changed to '0'.
    #- If a '1' is followed by a '0', the '0' will be changed to '1'.
    #- If a '1' is followed by another '1' and a '0', the first '1' will be changed to '-1', the second '1' will be changed to '0', and the '0' will be changed to '1'.
    #- If the last bit is '0' and the flag is set, the last bit will be changed to '1'.
    #- If the last bit is '1' and the flag is set, the last bit will be changed to '0' and an additional '1' will be appended to the end.
    #- If a '-1' is followed by a '1', the '-1' will be moved to the left and the '1' will be changed to '0'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
