Output State: The output state will be the number of test cases (t) followed by the modified binary representation of each test case. The binary representation will have the following properties: 
- If two consecutive bits are '1', the first bit will be changed to '-1' and the second bit will be changed to '0'.
- If a '1' is followed by a '0', the '0' will be changed to '1'.
- If a '1' is followed by another '1' and a '0', the first '1' will be changed to '-1', the second '1' will be changed to '0', and the '0' will be changed to '1'.
- If the last bit is '0' and the flag is set, the last bit will be changed to '1'.
- If the last bit is '1' and the flag is set, the last bit will be changed to '0' and an additional '1' will be appended to the end.
- If a '-1' is followed by a '1', the '-1' will be moved to the left and the '1' will be changed to '0'.
