Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a series of binary strings, each representing the modified binary representation of the input integers. The length of each binary string will be 30 or 31, depending on whether the input integer had a trailing '1' bit. The binary strings will have the following properties:

*   All occurrences of consecutive '1' bits will be replaced with '-1' and '0' bits.
*   If a '1' bit is followed by a '0' bit, the '0' bit will be replaced with a '1' bit.
*   If a '-1' bit is followed by a '1' bit, the '1' bit will be replaced with a '0' bit and the '-1' bit will be moved to the previous position.
*   If the input integer had a trailing '1' bit, an additional '1' bit will be appended to the end of the binary string.

The output state will be a series of these modified binary strings, each representing the transformed binary representation of the input integers.
