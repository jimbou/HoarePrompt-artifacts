The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line of input contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases. After accepting this integer, the stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been consumed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (with the first line consumed)**
