This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case is a positive integer. It then modifies the binary representation of each integer according to specific rules, including replacing consecutive '1's, changing '1' followed by '0' to '0' followed by '1', and adjusting the last bit based on a flag. The function outputs the length of the modified binary representation and the representation itself, with any necessary adjustments to handle '-1' and '1' combinations.
