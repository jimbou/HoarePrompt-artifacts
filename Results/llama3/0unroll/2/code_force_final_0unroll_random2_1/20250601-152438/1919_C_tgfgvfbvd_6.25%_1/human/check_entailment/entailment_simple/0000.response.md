Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences and calculating the penalty for each subsequence.

The program first initializes two variables `a` and `b` to the first element of the array, and a counter `c` to 0. It then iterates through the array from the second element to the end. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than the previous element. If it is, it updates `b` to the current element and breaks out of the loop.

After the loop, it iterates through the remaining elements of the array. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than both `a` and `b`. If it is, it updates either `a` or `b` depending on which one is closer to the current element, and increments the counter `c`. If the element is less than both `a` and `b`, it updates either `a` or `b` depending on which one is closer to the current element. If the element is less than or equal to `a`, it updates `a` to the current element. Otherwise, it updates `b` to the current element.

Finally, it prints the value of `c`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the array has only one element, or where the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

Correctness: **True**
