Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to split the input array into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The program iterates through the array, maintaining two variables `a` and `b` to keep track of the maximum values in `s` and `t` respectively. It also maintains a count `c` of the number of times an element is added to either `s` or `t` that is greater than the previous element in that subsequence.

The program correctly handles the cases where an element is greater than both `a` and `b`, less than both `a` and `b`, or equal to either `a` or `b`. It also correctly updates `a` and `b` based on the comparisons.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

Note: The program's logic is not the most efficient, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops. However, this does not affect its correctness.
