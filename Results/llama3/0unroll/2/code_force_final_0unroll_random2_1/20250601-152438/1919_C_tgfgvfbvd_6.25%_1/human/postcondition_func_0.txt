This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then analyzes each list to find the number of times a subsequence of three numbers (a, b, c) appears, where a < b < c and the difference between a and c is greater than or equal to the difference between b and c. The function prints the count of such subsequences for each test case.
