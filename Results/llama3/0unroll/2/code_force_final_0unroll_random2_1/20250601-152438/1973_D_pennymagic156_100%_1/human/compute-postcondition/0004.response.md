Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the variables n and k remaining unchanged. The loop has printed a series of queries in the format '? l i * v' and possibly a final answer in the format '! i * v', where l is a value between 1 and n (inclusive), i is a value between 1 and n // k (inclusive), and v is the smallest integer i such that i * n >= n, or 1 if no such i exists. The function func_2() has been called multiple times, but its effects are not specified in the given code.
