Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the hidden array `n` and the number of subarrays `k`. It then determines the smallest integer `i` such that `i * n >= n`, or 1 if no such `i` exists, and uses this value to print a series of queries in the format `? l i * v` and possibly a final answer in the format `! i * v`. If no answer is found, it prints `! -1`. The program also calls another function, `func_2()`, multiple times, but its effects are not specified. However, based on the problem statement, it is likely that `func_2()` is used to read the response from Fox for each query.

Correctness: **True**
