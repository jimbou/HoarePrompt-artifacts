Output State: The loop will execute for i values from 1 to n // k (integer division), and for each i, it will print a series of '?' queries with increasing values of l (starting from 1) and i * v, until cnt reaches 0 or l reaches n + 1. If cnt reaches 0 and l equals n + 1, it will print a '!' statement with i * v and call func_2() before returning. The output state will be the final values of i, l, cnt, and v after the loop finishes executing.
