Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, v is 1**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line calls a function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, the values of `n` and `k` after this line are still within these constraints. The second line assigns the value 1 to `v`. The third line is a pass statement, which does not affect any variables.

Therefore, the final state of the program is that `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, and `v` is 1.
