Functionality: **This function determines the smallest integer i such that i * n >= n, or 1 if no such i exists, and uses this value to print a series of queries in the format '? l i * v' and possibly a final answer in the format '! i * v'. If no answer is found, it prints '! -1'. The function also calls another function, func_2(), multiple times, but its effects are not specified. The input variables n and k remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.**
