Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case when k = 1 and n > 1. In this case, the program should return the maximum value of f(1, n), but instead, it tries to find a value of i such that i * v = n, which is not necessary. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, if n = 3 and k = 1, the program will try to find a value of i such that i * v = 3, but since v is initialized to 1, this will not be possible, and the program will return -1, which is incorrect. The correct result should be the maximum value of f(1, 3), which is 3.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly in all cases, and its correctness is **False**.
