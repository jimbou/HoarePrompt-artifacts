Functionality: **This function reads a series of strings from standard input, determines if each string contains more than one unique character, and prints 'NO' if it doesn't. If a string contains more than one unique character, it prints 'YES' followed by the sorted or reverse-sorted version of the string, depending on whether the original string was already sorted or not. The function processes multiple strings, with the number of strings specified by an initial integer input.**
