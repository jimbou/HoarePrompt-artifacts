Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required logic to determine if a given string can be rearranged to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. The program first checks if the string contains more than one unique character. If it doesn't, it prints 'NO'. If it does, it prints 'YES' and then prints the sorted or reverse-sorted version of the string, depending on whether the original string was already sorted or not. This approach ensures that the output string is always different from the original string, as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
