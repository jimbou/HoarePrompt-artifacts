Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "abba", the program will output "YES" and then print the sorted string "aabb", which is equal to the original string "abba". This is not a valid solution because the problem statement requires the rearranged string to be different from the original string.

In this case, the program fails to find a valid rearrangement of the string "abba" that is different from the original string. A correct solution would be to check if the sorted string is equal to the original string, and if so, try a different approach to find a valid rearrangement.
