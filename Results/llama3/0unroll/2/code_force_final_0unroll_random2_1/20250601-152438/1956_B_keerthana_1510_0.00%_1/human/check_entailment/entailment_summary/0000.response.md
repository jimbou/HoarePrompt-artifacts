Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly reads the input, processes the data, and prints the expected output.

The program uses a generator expression to read every other line from the input starting from the third line (index 2), splits each line into a list of elements, and then uses another generator expression to count the occurrences of each unique element in the list. The count is divided by 3 because the problem statement guarantees that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2 times. Therefore, the maximum number of points that can be scored is the sum of the counts of each unique integer divided by 3.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
