This function calculates and prints the number of pairs (i, j) such that 1 <= i <= a, 4 <= j <= b, and (j + i) is divisible by j times the greatest common divisor of i and j, minus 1, for each test case provided in the input. It takes no arguments and returns no value, instead printing the result for each test case.
