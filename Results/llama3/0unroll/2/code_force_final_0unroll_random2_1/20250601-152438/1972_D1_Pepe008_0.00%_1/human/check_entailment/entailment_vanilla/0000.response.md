Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The conditions are:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b \* gcd(a, b)

The program uses a brute force approach to iterate over all possible values of 'a' and 'b' within the given ranges. For each pair (a, b), it checks if the condition (a + b) % (b \* math.gcd(a, b)) == 0 is satisfied. If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count of valid pairs.

However, the program has a logical error in the calculation of the count of valid pairs. The program calculates the count as (a - i \* (i - 1)) // i \*\* 2 + 1, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of 'a' and 'b' and check if the condition (a + b) % (b \* math.gcd(a, b)) == 0 is satisfied. If the condition is satisfied, increment the count of valid pairs.

Here is the correct code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, a + 1):
            for j in range(1, b + 1):
                if (j + i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

Correctness: **False**
