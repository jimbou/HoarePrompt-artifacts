Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the calculation of the variable `x`. The current calculation of `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, which is incorrect.

The correct calculation of `x` should be the number of multiples of `i` that are less than or equal to `a`. This can be calculated as `a // i`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = a // i
            suma += x
        print(suma)
```

This corrected code calculates the correct number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.
