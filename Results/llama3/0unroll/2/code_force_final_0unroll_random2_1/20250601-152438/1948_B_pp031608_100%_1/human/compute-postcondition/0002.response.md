Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It checks if the integers can be sorted in descending order by repeatedly replacing the smaller of two adjacent elements with the largest digit of the larger element. If the integers can be sorted, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases.**
