Output State: **The loop will have executed n times, where n is the initial value of the variable n. The variable m will have been reassigned to the value of the input integer in each iteration, and the variable arr will have been reassigned to a list of integers parsed from the input string in each iteration. The variable ans will have been set to True or False depending on whether the list arr is sorted in descending order after the inner loop executes. The output of the loop will be a string 'YES' if ans is True, and 'NO' if ans is False, printed to the console n times. The initial value of n will remain unchanged.**
