Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make a sorted array in non-descending order using the given operation. The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, and whenever it encounters a pair of elements that are not in non-descending order, it checks if the larger element can be split into digits to make the pair sorted. If it is not possible to make the pair sorted, it sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted, or when the array cannot be sorted using the given operation.

Correctness: **True**
