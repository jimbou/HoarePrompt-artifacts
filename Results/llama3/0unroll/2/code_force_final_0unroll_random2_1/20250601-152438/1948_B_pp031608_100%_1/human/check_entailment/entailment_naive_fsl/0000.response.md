Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the array has more than two elements and the operation needs to be applied multiple times. For example, if the input is [12, 3, 45, 67], the program will split the first element into [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], but it will not check if the resulting array is sorted. If the array is not sorted after the first operation, the program will not apply the operation again to make it sorted.

In the given example, the program will print "YES" for the input [12, 3, 45, 67], but it should print "NO" because the array is not sorted after the first operation.

The correct solution should check if the array is sorted after each operation and apply the operation again if the array is not sorted.
