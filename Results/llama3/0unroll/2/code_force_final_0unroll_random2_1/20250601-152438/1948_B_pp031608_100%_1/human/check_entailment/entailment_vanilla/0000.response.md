Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements.

3. It then initializes a variable `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.

4. The program then iterates over the array from the second last element to the first element (in reverse order).

5. For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, it means that the array is not sorted.

6. In this case, it splits the previous element into its digits and appends the current element to the list of digits.

7. It then checks if the resulting list is sorted. If it is not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks the loop.

8. If the loop completes without finding any unsorted pairs, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly checks if the array can be sorted by splitting elements into their digits and appending them to the array. It also correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the line where it updates `arr[i - 1]`, it only updates the first digit of the split element. It should update `arr[i - 1]` with the first digit of the split element, and then insert the remaining digits into the array.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr = arr[:i-1] + nums + arr[i:]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

Correctness: **False**
