Output State: **The number of integers that appear at least three times in each test case is printed to the console. The input state remains unchanged, with 'w' still being an integer between 1 and 100, and stdin containing 'w' test cases. Each test case still consists of an integer 'n' (1 <= n <= 100) followed by 'n' integers 'a_1', 'a_2', ..., 'a_n' (1 <= a_i <= 100).**
