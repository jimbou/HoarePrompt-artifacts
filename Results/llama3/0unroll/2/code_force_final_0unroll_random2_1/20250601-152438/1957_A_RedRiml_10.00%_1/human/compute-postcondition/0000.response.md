Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains w test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the variable `w` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `w` test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` between 1 and 100, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, each between 1 and 100.
