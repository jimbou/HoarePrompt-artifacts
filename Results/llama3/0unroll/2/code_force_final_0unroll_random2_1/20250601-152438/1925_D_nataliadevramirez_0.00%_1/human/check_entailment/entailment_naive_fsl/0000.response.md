Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not take into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that the teacher chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. This means that the probability of choosing a pair of friends is not constant and changes after each excursion.

The program assumes that the friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions, which is not correct. The correct approach would be to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values by taking into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

For example, consider the case where there are 2 children, 1 pair of friends, and 2 excursions. The friendship value of the pair of friends is 1. In the first excursion, the probability of choosing the pair of friends is 1/1 = 1. In the second excursion, the probability of choosing the pair of friends is 1/1 = 1, since the pair of friends has already been chosen in the first excursion. The expected value of the sum of friendship values would be 1 + 1 = 2, not 1 + 2 = 3 as calculated by the program.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem and is incorrect.
