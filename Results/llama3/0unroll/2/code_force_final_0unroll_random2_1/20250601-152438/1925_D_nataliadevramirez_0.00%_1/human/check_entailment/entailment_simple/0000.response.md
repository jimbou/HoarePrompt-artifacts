Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program uses a modular arithmetic approach to avoid overflow and ensure the result is within the required range.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all tuples `(a, b, f)` in `friendships`, where `MOD` is a modulus value, `k` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum is taken modulo `MOD`.

`func_2` reads the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the required logic and uses modular arithmetic to avoid overflow. The use of `MOD` ensures that the result is within the required range.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program calculates the sum of `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for all tuples `(a, b, f)` in `friendships`, but it does not take into account the probability of each pair being chosen. The probability of each pair being chosen is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`, where `n` is the number of children.

To fix this error, the program should multiply the sum by the probability of each pair being chosen. The corrected code for `func_1` should be:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        a, b, f = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    result = (result * pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, MOD - 2, MOD)) % MOD
    return result
```

With this correction, the program will correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Correctness: **False**
