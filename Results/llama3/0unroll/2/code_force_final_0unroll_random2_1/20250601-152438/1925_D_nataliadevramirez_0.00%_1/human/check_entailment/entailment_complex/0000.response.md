Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving friendships and excursions. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Function 1 calculates the sum of a weighted arithmetic series for each tuple in a list of friendships, where the weight is the frequency of the friendship, and returns the total sum modulo a given modulus value.

Function 2 accepts input data, processes it, and calls Function 1 to calculate the result. It then prints the result to the console.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that Function 1 does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in Function 1, `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, does not take into account the probability of each pair being chosen, which is a crucial aspect of the problem.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect, and the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
