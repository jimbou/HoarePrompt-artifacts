Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the sum of a weighted arithmetic series for each tuple in a list of friendships, where the weight is the frequency of the friendship, and returns the total sum modulo a given modulus value. This function seems to be correct as it correctly calculates the sum of the weighted arithmetic series for each friendship and returns the total sum modulo the given modulus value.

`func_2` accepts the input data, processes it, and prints the result. It calls `func_1` with the correct parameters and prints the result. This function seems to be correct as it correctly processes the input data and prints the result.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not take into account the fact that the friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0 and does not change for subsequent excursions. The program only calculates the sum of the weighted arithmetic series for the friendships that exist, but it does not consider the pairs that are not friends.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
