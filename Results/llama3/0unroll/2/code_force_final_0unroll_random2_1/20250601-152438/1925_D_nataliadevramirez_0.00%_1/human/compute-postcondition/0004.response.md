Functionality: **This function calculates the sum of a weighted arithmetic series for each tuple in a list of friendships, where the weight is the frequency of the friendship, and returns the total sum modulo a given modulus value. The function takes four parameters: a positive integer n, a non-negative integer m, a positive integer k, and a list of m tuples representing friendships, where each tuple contains three positive integers a, b, and f. The function returns a single value, which is the sum of f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD for all tuples (a, b, f) in friendships, taken modulo MOD.**
