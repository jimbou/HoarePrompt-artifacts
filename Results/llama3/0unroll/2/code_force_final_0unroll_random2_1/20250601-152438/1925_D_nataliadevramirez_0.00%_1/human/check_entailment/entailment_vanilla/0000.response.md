Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The given program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to solve the problem.

`func_1` calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for a given set of friendships. It iterates over each friendship, calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for that friendship, and adds it to the total result.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1.  The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of choosing each pair of friends, which is not taken into account in the program.

2.  The program does not handle the case where the pair of friends is chosen more than once. In this case, the friendship value should increase by 1 for each subsequent excursion, which is not correctly handled in the program.

3.  The program does not correctly calculate the modular inverse of the denominator. The modular inverse is calculated using the `pow` function with a negative exponent, but this is not correct for the given modulus.

4.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of children is large. In this case, the number of possible pairs of friends can be very large, and the program may run out of memory or take a long time to run.

5.  The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of excursions is large. In this case, the expected value of the sum of friendship values can be very large, and the program may overflow or take a long time to run.

Correctness: **False**
