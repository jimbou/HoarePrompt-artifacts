Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'result' will hold the output of the function func_1 for the last iteration of the loop, and the variables 'n', 'm', 'k', and 'friendships' will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The values of 't' and 'stdin' remain unchanged.**
