Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer such that m <= n*(n-1)/2, k is a positive integer, friendships is a list of m lists, each containing three positive integers a, b, and f such that a != b, 1 <= a, b <= n, and 1 <= f <= 10^9, t is a positive integer, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, k, and friendships remain unchanged. The variable t is assigned the value of the input integer, which is a positive integer. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to read the input for t.
