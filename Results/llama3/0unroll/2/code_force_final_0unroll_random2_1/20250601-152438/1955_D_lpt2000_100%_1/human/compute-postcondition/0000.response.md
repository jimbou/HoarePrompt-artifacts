Output State: **`nabors` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). The third line contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m (1 <= b_i <= 10^6).**

In this output state, the value of `nabors` is an integer that was read from the first line of a test case in the input, which contained three integers: n, m, and k. The remaining two lines of the test case, containing n integers and m integers respectively, are still in the input.
