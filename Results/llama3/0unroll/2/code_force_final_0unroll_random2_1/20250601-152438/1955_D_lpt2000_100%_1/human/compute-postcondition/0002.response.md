Output State: The loop will execute `nabors` times, and in each iteration, it will read two lines of input from stdin, process the data, and print the result. After all iterations, the output state will be the cumulative result of all the iterations, which is the total number of times the condition `pairs_in_D >= k` is true for all test cases. The value of `nabors` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
