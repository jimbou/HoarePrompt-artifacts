This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers (n, m, and k), the second line contains n integers, and the third line contains m integers. It then processes each test case by counting the occurrences of integers in the second and third lines, and calculates the number of times a certain condition (pairs_in_D >= k) is true. The function prints the cumulative result of this calculation for all test cases.
