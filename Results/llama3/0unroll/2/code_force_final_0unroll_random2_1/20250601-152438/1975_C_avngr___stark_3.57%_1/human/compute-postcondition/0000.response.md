The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the number of test cases `t` is given at the beginning of the input, we can conclude that the first line of the input has been read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10^5), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 500, and the remaining input in stdin consists of multiple test cases, each with two lines as described.
