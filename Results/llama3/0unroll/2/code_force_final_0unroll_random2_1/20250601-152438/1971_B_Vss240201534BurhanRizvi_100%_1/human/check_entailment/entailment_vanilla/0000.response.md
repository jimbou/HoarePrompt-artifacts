Reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the length of the input string `s` is 1. If it is, it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

2. If the length of `s` is more than 1, it checks if all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`). If they are, it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange the characters to form a different string.

3. If `s` has more than one distinct character, it generates a new string `s2` by randomly rearranging the characters of `s`. If `s2` happens to be the same as `s`, it rearranges `s` by moving the first character to the end to ensure that `s2` is different from `s`.

4. Finally, it prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string `s2`.

This program correctly handles all possible cases and always produces a valid output according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
