Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the cases where the input string has only one unique character or is a single character, in which case it prints 'No'. For strings with more than one unique character, it generates a new string by either shuffling the characters or rotating the string, ensuring that the new string is not equal to the original string. The program also correctly handles the case where the shuffled string is equal to the original string, in which case it rotates the string instead.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all the possible cases mentioned in the problem description. The use of the `random.sample` function to shuffle the characters is also correct, as it ensures that the new string is a random permutation of the original string.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
