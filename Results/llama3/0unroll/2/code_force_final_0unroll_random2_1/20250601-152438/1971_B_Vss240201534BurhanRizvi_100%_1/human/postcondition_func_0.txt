This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks each string for uniqueness of characters and length, and if the string has more than one unique character, it generates a new string by either shuffling the characters or rotating the string, and prints the result. If the string has only one unique character or is a single character, it prints 'No'. The function continues this process until all input strings have been processed, leaving the standard input empty.
