Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has more than one character and all characters are the same, but the length of the string is greater than 2. In this case, the program will print "YES" and then print the original string, which is not a rearrangement of the original string.

For example, if the input is "aaa", the program will print "YES" and then print "aaa", which is not a rearrangement of the original string.

The program should print "NO" in this case, because it is impossible to rearrange the characters of the string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

The correct code should check if the length of the set of characters in the string is 1 and the length of the string is greater than 1, and print "NO" in this case.
