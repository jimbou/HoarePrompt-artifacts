The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). Since we only read the first integer from the input, the remaining test cases are still in the stdin. Therefore, the output state is: `loop` is an integer (2 <= loop <= 100), stdin contains the remaining test cases.

Output State: **`loop` is an integer (2 <= loop <= 100), stdin contains the remaining test cases.**
