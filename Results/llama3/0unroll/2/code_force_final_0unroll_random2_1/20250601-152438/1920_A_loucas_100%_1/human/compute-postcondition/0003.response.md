Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it categorizes input pairs of integers into three lists based on the first integer's value (1, 2, or 3). It then calculates the range between the minimum value in the 'less' list and the maximum value in the 'big' list, adjusts this range by 1, and subtracts the count of numbers in the 'no' list that fall within this range. The function prints the resulting count for each test case, which represents the number of integers in the 'no' list that do not fall within the calculated range. If the calculated range is less than 1, it prints 0 for that test case.**
