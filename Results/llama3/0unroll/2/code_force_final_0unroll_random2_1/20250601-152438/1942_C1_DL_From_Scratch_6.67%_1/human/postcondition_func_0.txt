This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then sorts the list of integers, counts the number of pairs of consecutive integers with a difference of 1, and adds the count of numbers that have a difference of 1 with the last number in the list. Finally, it prints the total count plus x minus 2 for each test case.
