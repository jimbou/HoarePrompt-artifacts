Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that Bessie can give out. It first sorts the list of chosen vertices and then iterates through the list to count the number of gaps between consecutive vertices that can form a triangle. It also checks the gap between the last vertex and the first vertex (wrapping around the polygon) to account for the case where the first and last vertices are adjacent.

The program correctly handles the case where y = 0, which means no additional vertices can be chosen. In this case, the program only considers the gaps between the chosen vertices and does not try to add any new vertices.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the number of chosen vertices is 2, in which case the maximum number of triangular pieces is 2.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
