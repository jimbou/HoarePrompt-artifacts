Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

In this output state, the value of `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, which is obtained from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is between 4 and 10^9, x is between 2 and the minimum of n and 2 * 10^5, and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
