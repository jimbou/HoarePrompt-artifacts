Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `i` is 1, if the square root of `q` is an integer greater than or equal to `x` - 1, then `M` is a list containing the integer square root of `q`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `q` and `x` remain the same as in the initial state, and `i` is assigned the value 1. The condition for `M` also remains the same, depending on the relationship between the square root of `q` and `x`.
