This function takes two integers, q and x, as input, where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, and returns a list M containing all the divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1. The function includes the square root of q in the list if it is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1. It then iterates through all numbers less than the square root of q, adding both the number and its corresponding quotient (q divided by the number) to the list if they are divisors of q and greater than or equal to x - 1. The function returns the list M, which contains all divisors of q that meet the specified condition.
