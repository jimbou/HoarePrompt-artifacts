Output State: **t is an integer, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). The first integer of stdin is the number of test cases minus one (0 <= t <= 499).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`. This input is the number of test cases, which is between 1 and 500. The second line initializes an empty list `r`. No other variables are affected. The state of `t` is now an integer, and `r` is an empty list. The state of stdin is updated to contain multiple test cases, with the first integer being the number of test cases minus one.
