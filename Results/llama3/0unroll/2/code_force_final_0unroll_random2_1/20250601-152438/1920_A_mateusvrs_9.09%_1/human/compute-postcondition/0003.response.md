Based on the precondition, we know that `t` is an integer, `r` is a list of integers, and `stdin` is empty.

The print statement `print(*r, sep='\n')` uses the `*` operator to unpack the elements of the list `r` into separate arguments to the `print` function. The `sep='\n'` argument specifies that each element should be separated by a newline character.

Since `r` is a list of integers, the `*` operator will unpack each integer element of the list into a separate argument to `print`. The `sep='\n'` argument will then insert a newline character between each integer.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of integers, each on a separate line, with no additional formatting or text.

Output: **a sequence of integers, each on a separate line, where the integers are the elements of the list r**
