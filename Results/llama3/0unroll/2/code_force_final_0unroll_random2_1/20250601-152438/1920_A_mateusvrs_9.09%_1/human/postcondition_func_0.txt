This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It processes each test case by finding the maximum value of x when a is 1, the minimum value of x when a is 2, and storing unique values of x when a is 3. If the maximum value of x when a is 1 is greater than or equal to the minimum value of x when a is 2, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it counts the number of unique values of x when a is 3 that fall within the range of the maximum value of x when a is 1 and the minimum value of x when a is 2, and appends the difference between the range and the count to the result list. Finally, it prints the result list, with each element on a separate line.
