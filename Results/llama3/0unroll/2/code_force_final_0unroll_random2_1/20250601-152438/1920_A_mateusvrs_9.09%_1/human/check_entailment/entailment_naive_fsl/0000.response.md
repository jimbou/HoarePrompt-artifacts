Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the minimum and maximum possible values of k (bx and ax) and a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to (cx). Then, it iterates over the constraints, updating bx and ax accordingly, and adding the values that k cannot be equal to cx.

After processing all constraints, it checks if bx is greater than or equal to ax, which means there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting the number of values that k cannot be equal to from the total number of values between bx and ax (inclusive), and appends this value to the result list.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where there are no possible values of k, or where there are multiple constraints of the same type. The use of a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to ensures that duplicate values are ignored, and the use of the min and max functions to update bx and ax ensures that the correct minimum and maximum values are used.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
