Output State: **The loop will execute t times, each time processing a test case. For each test case, it will read two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers each. It will then perform a series of operations to check if the input satisfies certain conditions. If the conditions are met, it will print 'yes', otherwise it will print 'no'. After processing all t test cases, the loop will terminate. The output state will be a series of 'yes' or 'no' printed to the console, one for each test case.**
