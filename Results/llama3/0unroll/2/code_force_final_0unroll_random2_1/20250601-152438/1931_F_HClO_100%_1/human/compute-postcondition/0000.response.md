Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by k lines, each containing n integers a_ij (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The remaining input in stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers a_ij, with the specified constraints on their values.
