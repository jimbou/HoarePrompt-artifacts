Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when there are more than two screenshots and the order of participants is not consistent across all screenshots. 

For example, consider the case where n = 4, k = 3, and the screenshots are:

1 2 3 4
2 1 3 4
3 1 2 4

The program will incorrectly output "yes" because it only checks the consistency of the order between the first two screenshots and then checks if the remaining screenshots are consistent with the order of the first two. However, it does not check if the order is consistent across all screenshots. In this case, the order is not consistent across all three screenshots, so the program should output "no".
