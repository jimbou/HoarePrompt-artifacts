Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers each. It then checks if the input satisfies certain conditions, specifically whether the rows can be rearranged to form a consistent pattern. If the conditions are met, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'. The function processes multiple test cases and prints a corresponding 'yes' or 'no' for each case.**
