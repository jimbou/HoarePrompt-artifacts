Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to. It handles the edge cases where m (the number of participants who posted screenshots) is 1 or 2, and it correctly checks if the rows can be rearranged to form a consistent pattern. The program also handles the case where the index of a1 or a2 is not found in the list. The execution summary also confirms that the program processes multiple test cases and prints a corresponding 'yes' or 'no' for each case.

Correctness: **True**
