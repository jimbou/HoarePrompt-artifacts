#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers and times is a non-negative integer.
    n = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
    #The program returns the difference between the last element of the list 'arr' and the element at the index calculated by max(-n, -1 - times), where 'n' is the length of 'arr' and 'times' is a non-negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of a given list of integers and the element at a specific index. The specific index is determined by subtracting a given non-negative integer 'times' from the end of the list, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary. The function effectively calculates the difference between the last element and the element 'times' positions before it, considering the list as a circular buffer.

    #This is printed: A list of integers representing the calculated values based on the given conditions, where the values are determined by the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string s1, the length of s1, and the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1 plus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a list of integers based on the indices of '<' and '>' characters in a given string s1, the length of s1, and the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1 plus 1. The function takes a string s1 as input and returns a list of integers representing the calculated values. The string s1 remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state. The returned list of integers represents the calculated values based on the given conditions, which are determined by the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string s1, the length of s1, and the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1 plus 1.
