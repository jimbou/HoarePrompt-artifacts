This function calculates and returns a list of integers based on the indices of '<' and '>' characters in a given string s1, the length of s1, and the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1 plus 1. The function takes a string s1 as input and returns a list of integers representing the calculated values. The string s1 remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any external state. The returned list of integers represents the calculated values based on the given conditions, which are determined by the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string s1, the length of s1, and the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1 plus 1.
