Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: s1 remains the same string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n remains the same positive integer, pre remains the same list of indices of '>' characters in s1 plus 1, totalOne becomes 0, preOne becomes an empty list, suffZero becomes a list containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1 plus 1, and ans becomes a list of integers representing the calculated values based on the given conditions.
