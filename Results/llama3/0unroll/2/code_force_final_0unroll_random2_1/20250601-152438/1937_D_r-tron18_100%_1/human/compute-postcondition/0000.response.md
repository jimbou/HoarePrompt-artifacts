Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer, pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1 plus 1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1 plus 1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of zeros of length n.**

Explanation:
The code block processes the string s1 and calculates various statistics about its contents. The variable pre stores the indices of '>' characters in s1, plus 1. The variable totalOne counts the number of '>' characters in s1. The variable preOne calculates the cumulative sums of the indices of '>' characters in s1, plus 1, starting from 0. The variable suffZero is initialized with a single element 0, but its purpose is not clear from this code snippet. The variable ans is initialized with a list of zeros of length n, but its purpose is also not clear from this code snippet. The original state of s1 and n remains unchanged.
