This function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of a given list of integers and the element at a specific index. The specific index is determined by subtracting a given non-negative integer 'times' from the end of the list, wrapping around to the start of the list if necessary. The function effectively calculates the difference between the last element and the element 'times' positions before it, considering the list as a circular buffer.
