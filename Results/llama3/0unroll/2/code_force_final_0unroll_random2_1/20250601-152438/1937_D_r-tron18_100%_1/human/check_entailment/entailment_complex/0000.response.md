Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave a grid based on the movement rules provided. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the difference between the last element of a list and the element at a specific index, considering the list as a circular buffer. This function is used in `func_2` to calculate the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.

`func_2` is the main function that calculates the list of integers representing the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. It uses the `func_1` function to calculate the indices of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1` and then uses these indices to calculate the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in `s1` plus 1. The function then uses these cumulative sums to calculate the final list of integers representing the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, it appears that the program correctly implements the movement rules and calculates the correct number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
