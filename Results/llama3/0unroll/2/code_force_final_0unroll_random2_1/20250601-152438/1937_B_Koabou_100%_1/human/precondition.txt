stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n} and a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n} (a_{1i} and a_{2i} are either 0 or 1). The number of test cases t is given on the first line (1 <= t <= 10^4).
