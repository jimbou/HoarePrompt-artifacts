Output State: The list s contains the string formed by taking the first i + 1 characters from the first string in list a and the rest of the characters from the second string in list a, where i is the index at which the first string has '1' and the second string has '0'. The variable x is set to this index i. If no such index is found, s contains the concatenation of the first string in list a and the last character of the second string in list a, and x is set to n - 1. The variable y is set to the index where the first string has '0' and the second string has '1'.
