Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length as the integer. The function processes each test case by finding the first occurrence of a '1' in the first string and a '0' in the second string, and then combines the first part of the first string with the second part of the second string to form a new string. If no such occurrence is found, it combines the first string with the last character of the second string. The function then finds the longest common suffix between the second string and the new string, and prints the new string and the length of the common suffix.**
