Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not a simple concatenation of the first row and the last column. For example, when the input is:

3
2
01
10

The program will output "011" as the lexicographically smallest string, but the correct output should be "010". The program also incorrectly calculates the number of paths that yield this string.

The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for the first occurrence of a '1' in the first row and a '0' in the second row, and then concatenates the rest of the strings. However, this approach does not consider all possible paths that can be taken by the grasshopper.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using dynamic programming to keep track of all possible paths and their corresponding strings.
