Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines the most frequent letter in a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It initializes counters for 'A' and 'B', then iterates over the string, incrementing the appropriate counter for each letter. Finally, it prints the letter with the higher count.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings with more 'A's than 'B's
* Strings with more 'B's than 'A's
* Strings with equal numbers of 'A's and 'B's (in which case it prints 'B', which is a valid solution)

The program does not have any obvious edge cases or missing logic, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
