The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 32) followed by `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.**
