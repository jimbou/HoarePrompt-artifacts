Output State: **fillvalue is a string, a decorator is defined to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call.**

In this output state, the value of fillvalue remains unchanged as a string. The code defines a decorator that can be used to modify the behavior of a repr function. When this decorator is applied to a repr function, it will make the function return the value of fillvalue for a recursive call.
