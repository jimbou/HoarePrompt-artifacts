Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) consisting of characters 'U' and 'D', `num_up` is the number of 'U's in `s`.**

In this output state, the string `s` remains unchanged, with a length between 1 and 100, consisting only of characters 'U' and 'D'. The variable `num_up` is assigned the count of 'U' characters in the string `s`, which can be any value between 0 and `n`.
