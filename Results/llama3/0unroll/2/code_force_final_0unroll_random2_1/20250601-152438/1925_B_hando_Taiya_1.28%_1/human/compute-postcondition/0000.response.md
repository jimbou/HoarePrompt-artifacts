The first line assigns the integer value of the first two inputs to `x` and `n`. So now stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `ans`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers**
