Output State: **The output state is the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size n x n, where n is the number of test cases, and k is the number of pairs of integers r_i and c_i. The output is calculated using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic.**

In natural language, the output state represents the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size n x n, where n is the number of test cases, and k is the number of pairs of integers r_i and c_i. The output is calculated using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic. The loop iterates over each test case, calculates the number of ways to place a domino on the grid, and prints the result. The output state is the final result of the loop, which is the number of ways to place a domino on the grid for each test case.
