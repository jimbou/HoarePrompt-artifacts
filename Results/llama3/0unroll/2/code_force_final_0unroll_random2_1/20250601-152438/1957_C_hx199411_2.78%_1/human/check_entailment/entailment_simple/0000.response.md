Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size n x n, where n is the number of test cases, and k is the number of pairs of integers r_i and c_i. The program also uses modular arithmetic to prevent overflow.

The program first calculates the number of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. It then calculates the number of remaining rows and columns that are available for placing new rooks. If there are no remaining rows and columns, the program prints 0. If there is only one remaining row and column, the program prints 1. Otherwise, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place a domino on the remaining grid.

The dynamic programming approach used by the program is correct. The program initializes a list dp of size m + 1, where m is the number of remaining rows and columns. The program then calculates the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size i x i, for i ranging from 1 to m. The program uses the following recurrence relation to calculate the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size i x i:

dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2

This recurrence relation is correct because it takes into account the two possible ways to place a domino on a grid of size i x i: either by placing a domino on the top row, or by placing a domino on the leftmost column. The program also uses modular arithmetic to prevent overflow.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
