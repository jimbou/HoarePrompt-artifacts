This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size n x n for each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. The function iterates over multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and k pairs of integers, and calculates the result using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic. The output is printed to standard output.
