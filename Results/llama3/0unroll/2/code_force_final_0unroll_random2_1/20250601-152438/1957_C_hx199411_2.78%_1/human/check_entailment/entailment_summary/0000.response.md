Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program correctly handles the base cases where m is 0 or 1, and it uses modular arithmetic to prevent overflow for larger values of m. The dynamic programming approach is also efficient, with a time complexity of O(m), which is suitable for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
