Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size n x n, where n is the number of test cases, and k is the number of pairs of integers r_i and c_i.

The program first reads the input from standard input, which consists of an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by k pairs of integers r_i and c_i (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n).

The program then calculates the number of ways to place a domino on the grid for each test case. It uses a dynamic programming approach, where it calculates the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size m x m, where m is the number of remaining cells on the grid after k moves.

The program correctly handles the base cases where m is 0, 1, or 2, and then uses a loop to calculate the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size m x m for m >= 3. The loop uses the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) to calculate the number of ways to place a domino on a grid of size i x i.

Finally, the program prints the result for each test case to standard output.

Correctness: **True**
