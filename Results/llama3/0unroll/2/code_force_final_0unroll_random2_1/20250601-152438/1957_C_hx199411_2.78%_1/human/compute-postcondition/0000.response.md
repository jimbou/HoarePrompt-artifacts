Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) followed by k pairs of integers r_i and c_i (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 1 and 3 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `k` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive). Following these two integers, there are `k` pairs of integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where both `r_i` and `c_i` are between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
