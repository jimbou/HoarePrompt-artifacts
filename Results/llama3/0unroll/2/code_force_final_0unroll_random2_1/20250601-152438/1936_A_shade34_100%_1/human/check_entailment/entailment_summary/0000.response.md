Reasoning: 

The program is designed to solve an interactive problem where it needs to find two indices i and j in a secret permutation p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program can ask queries in the form of "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of p_a and p_b with the bitwise OR of p_c and p_d.

The program first finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum. It then finds all elements that have the same maximum value by comparing each element with the maximum element.

Finally, it finds the index of the second maximum element by comparing each element with the current second maximum. The program then prints the indices of the maximum and second maximum elements.

The program uses at most 3n queries, where n is the number of elements in the permutation, which is within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
