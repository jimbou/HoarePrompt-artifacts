Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input hour is 12 and the minute is not 00. For example, if the input is "12:30", the program will output "12:30 AM" instead of "12:30 PM". This is because the program sets the day to 'AM' when the hour is 12, without considering the minute.

The correct logic should be to set the day to 'PM' when the hour is 12, regardless of the minute. The program should also handle the case when the hour is 0 and the minute is not 00, in which case the output should be "12:xx AM".
