Reasoning:

1. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a string representing a time in 24-hour format, splits it into hours `h` and minutes `m`, and converts them to integers.
3. It then checks the hour `h` to determine the equivalent time in 12-hour format:
	* If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
	* If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'.
	* If `h` is less than or equal to 12, it sets `day` to 'AM', unless `h` is exactly 12, in which case it sets `day` to 'PM'.
4. Finally, it prints the time in 12-hour format, padding the hour with a leading zero if necessary, followed by the `day` string.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to convert 24-hour format to 12-hour format, handling the edge cases correctly. The use of `f-strings` for formatting the output is also correct.
