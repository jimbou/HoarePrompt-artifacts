Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert 24-hour time format to 12-hour time format. It takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).

The program correctly handles the conversion logic:

- If the hour is 0, it sets the hour to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
- If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day to 'PM'.
- If the hour is less than or equal to 12, it sets the day to 'AM', unless the hour is exactly 12, in which case it sets the day to 'PM'.

The program then prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", using the `f-string` formatting to ensure that the hour and minute values are always two digits, padding with zeros if necessary.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases for 24-hour time conversion to 12-hour time format.

Correctness: **True**
