Output State: **day is 'AM', n is an integer between 1 and 1440, stdin contains t-1 strings, each representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm).**

The first line assigns the string 'AM' to the variable day. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to the variable n. Since stdin initially contains an integer t followed by t strings, after reading the first integer, stdin will be left with t-1 strings. The value of n will be an integer between 1 and 1440, as specified in the initial state.
