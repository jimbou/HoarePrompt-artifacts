Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if there is a row with exactly one '1' and if so, it outputs 'TRIANGLE'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple rows with more than one '1'. The program also checks if there is a row with more than one '1' and if so, it outputs 'SQUARE'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square must have all rows with the same number of '1's, which is not checked by the program.

Moreover, the program does not correctly handle the case where the shape is a square. It only checks if there is a row with more than one '1' and if so, it outputs 'SQUARE'. However, it does not check if all rows have the same number of '1's, which is a necessary condition for a square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and will produce incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
