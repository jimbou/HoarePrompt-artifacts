Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines each containing a string of n characters '0' or '1'.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n lines of strings containing '0' or '1' characters. The value of t is now known and is a positive integer.
