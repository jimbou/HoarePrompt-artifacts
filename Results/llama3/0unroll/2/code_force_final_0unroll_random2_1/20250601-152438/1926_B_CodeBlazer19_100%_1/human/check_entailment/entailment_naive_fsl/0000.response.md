Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The issue lies in the way it checks for triangles and squares. 

For triangles, it checks if there is a row with exactly one '1', but this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple rows with multiple '1's, as long as the number of '1's in each row increases by 2.

For squares, it checks if there is a row with more than one '1', but this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Here is a counterexample:

Input:

    4
    
    0000
    
    0100
    
    1110
    
    0000

The program will output "SQUARE", but the correct output is "TRIANGLE".

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly check for the properties of triangles and squares. For example, it could check if the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 for triangles, and if the number of '1's is the same in each row and the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge for squares.
