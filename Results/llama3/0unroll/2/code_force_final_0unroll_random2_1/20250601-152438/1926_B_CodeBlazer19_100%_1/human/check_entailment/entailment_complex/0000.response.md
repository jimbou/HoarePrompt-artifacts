Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if there is a row with exactly one '1' and if so, it outputs 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, it outputs 'SQUARE'. However, this logic is not sufficient to determine the shape of the grid.

A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row. The program does not check for this condition. It only checks if there is a row with exactly one '1', which is not a sufficient condition to determine a triangle.

On the other hand, a square can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's is the same in each row. The program does not check for this condition either. It only checks if there is a row with more than one '1', which is not a sufficient condition to determine a square.

Therefore, the program can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
