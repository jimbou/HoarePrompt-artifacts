Output State: **The output state is a series of integers, each representing the total number of characters that need to be added to the string `a` to make all characters appear at least `m` times. The number of integers in the output state is equal to the value of `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the stdin is empty after the loop execution.**
