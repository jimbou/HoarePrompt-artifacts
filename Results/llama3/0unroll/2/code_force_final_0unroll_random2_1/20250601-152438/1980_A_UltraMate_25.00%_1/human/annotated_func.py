#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the total number of characters that need to be added to the string `a` to make all characters appear at least `m` times. The number of integers in the output state is equal to the value of `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the stdin is empty after the loop execution.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and a string of n characters. It calculates the total number of characters that need to be added to the string to make all characters appear at least m times, and prints this total for each test case. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases specified by an initial integer input.
