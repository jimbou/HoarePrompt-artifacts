The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. 

Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `t` is now an integer between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
