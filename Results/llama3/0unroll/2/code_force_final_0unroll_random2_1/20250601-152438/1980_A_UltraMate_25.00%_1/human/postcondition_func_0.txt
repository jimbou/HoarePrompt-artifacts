This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and a string of n characters. It calculates the total number of characters that need to be added to the string to make all characters appear at least m times, and prints this total for each test case. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases specified by an initial integer input.
