Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time reading two integers `n` and `m` and a string `s` of length `n` from the standard input. After processing each test case, the loop will print the total number of characters that need to be added to the string `s` to make all characters appear at least `m` times. The output will be `t` lines, each containing a single integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `s` will be consumed from the standard input and will not be retained after the loop finishes executing.
