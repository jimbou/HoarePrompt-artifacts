Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, `a` is a string of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `count` is a list of 7 integers where each integer at index `i` represents the frequency of the character `chr(ord('A') + i)` in string `a`, `needed_problems` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still between 1 and 50, the value of `m` is still between 1 and 5, the string `a` still has `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', the list `count` still stores the frequency of each character in string `a`, and a new variable `needed_problems` is introduced with a value of 0.
