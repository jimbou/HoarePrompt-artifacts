Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of numbers, including k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i), and 20 binary numbers (powers of 2) excluding the binary number corresponding to the value of i, where i is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to k. The function then prints the length of this list followed by its elements, separated by spaces, for each test case.**
