Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem of recovering a palindrome array from the sums of its distinct subarrays. The program consists of four functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4`.

`func_1` generates all possible subarray sums of a given array `a` and returns them in sorted order.

`func_2` takes the sorted list of subarray sums and returns a list of odd counts, which are the sums that appear an odd number of times in the original list.

`func_3` takes the list of odd counts and the size of the original array `n` as input and returns a palindrome array `a` that satisfies the conditions.

`func_4` is not used in the provided code, but it seems to be a helper function to remove common elements from the end of two lists.

The program works by first generating all possible subarray sums of the original array, then identifying the sums that appear an odd number of times. These odd counts are used to construct the palindrome array.

The program correctly handles the case where the missing subarray sum is the sum of the entire array, as well as the case where the missing subarray sum is the sum of a single element.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array has an odd length, as well as the case where the input array has an even length.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
