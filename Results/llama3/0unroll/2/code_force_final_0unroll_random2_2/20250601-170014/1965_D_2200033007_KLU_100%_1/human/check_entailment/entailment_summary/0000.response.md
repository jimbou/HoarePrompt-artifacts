Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of recovering a palindrome array from the sums of its distinct subarrays. The program uses four functions to achieve this goal.

Function 1 calculates the cumulative sums of sublists starting from each index in the input list. This function is used to generate the sums of subarrays for a given array.

Function 2 filters out integers that appear an even number of times in the input list, preserving the order of appearance for the remaining integers. This function is used to identify the sums of odd-length subarrays.

Function 3 constructs a palindrome array from a list of sums of odd-length subarrays. This function is used to recover the original palindrome array.

Function 4 compares two lists and returns the last element of the 'bigList' after removing common trailing elements from both lists. This function is used to find the missing sum of the subarray.

The main program iterates over the test cases, reads the input, and uses the four functions to recover the palindrome array. The program handles two cases: when the length of the 'odds' list is greater than (n + 1) // 2, and when it is not. In both cases, the program correctly calculates the missing sum and recovers the palindrome array.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
