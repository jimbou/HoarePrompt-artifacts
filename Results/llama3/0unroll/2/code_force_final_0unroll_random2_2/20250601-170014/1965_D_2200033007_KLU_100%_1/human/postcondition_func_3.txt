This function compares two lists, 'bigList' and 'smallList', and returns the last element of 'bigList' after removing common trailing elements from both lists. The function modifies both input lists by popping elements from the end until they are no longer equal or until 'smallList' is empty. The function then returns the last element of the modified 'bigList'.
