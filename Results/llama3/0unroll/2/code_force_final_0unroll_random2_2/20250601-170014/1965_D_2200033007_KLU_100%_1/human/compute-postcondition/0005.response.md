Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a sorted list of cumulative sums of sublists starting from each index. The input list remains unchanged. The function calculates the cumulative sum of all possible sublists of the input list, sorts these sums in ascending order, and returns them as a new list.**
