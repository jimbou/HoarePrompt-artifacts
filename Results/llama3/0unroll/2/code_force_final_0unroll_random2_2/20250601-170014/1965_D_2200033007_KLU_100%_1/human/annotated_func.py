    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns a sorted list of cumulative sums of sublists of `a` starting from each index, where `a` is a list of non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns a sorted list of cumulative sums of sublists starting from each index. The input list remains unchanged. The function calculates the cumulative sum of all possible sublists of the input list, sorts these sums in ascending order, and returns them as a new list.

    return odds
    #The program returns a list of integers containing the elements of `cts` that appear an odd number of times in `cts`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the integers that appear an odd number of times in the original list. The function effectively filters out integers that appear an even number of times, preserving the order of appearance for the remaining integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of positive integers representing the sums of odd-length subarrays of a palindrome array a, and n is a positive integer representing the length of a. The list odds contains the sums of all odd-length subarrays of a, in non-increasing order, and n is odd.

            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: odds is a list of positive integers representing the sums of odd-length subarrays of a palindrome array a, n is a positive integer representing the length of a, a is a list of n integers where the first half of the list contains the sums of odd-length subarrays of a palindrome array a, prev is the last element of odds, and idx is -1.
    return a
    #The program returns a list of n integers where the first half of the list contains the sums of odd-length subarrays of a palindrome array a.

#Overall this is what the function does:Constructs a palindrome array from a list of sums of odd-length subarrays.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList and smallList are lists of elements of any type and value, and bigList is longer than smallList.
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: bigList and smallList are lists of elements of any type and value, and bigList is longer than or equal to smallList.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'bigList' which is a list of elements of any type and value and is longer than or equal to 'smallList'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two lists, 'bigList' and 'smallList', and returns the last element of 'bigList' after removing common trailing elements from both lists. The function modifies both input lists by popping elements from the end until they are no longer equal or until 'smallList' is empty. The function then returns the last element of the modified 'bigList'.
