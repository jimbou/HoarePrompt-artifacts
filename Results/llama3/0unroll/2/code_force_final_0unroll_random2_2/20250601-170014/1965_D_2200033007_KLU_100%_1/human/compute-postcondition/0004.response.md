Functionality: **Constructs a palindrome array from a list of sums of odd-length subarrays.**

This function takes a list of positive integers `odds` representing the sums of odd-length subarrays of a palindrome array and an integer `n` representing the length of the array. It returns a list of `n` integers, where the first half of the list contains the sums of odd-length subarrays of the constructed palindrome array. The function constructs the array by iterating through the `odds` list and assigning values to the array `a` in a way that ensures the resulting array is a palindrome.
