Output State: **bigList and smallList are lists of elements of any type and value, and bigList is longer than or equal to smallList.**

In the output state, the loop has removed all the common elements from the end of both lists. If there were more common elements in bigList than in smallList, the remaining common elements in bigList are still present. If there were no common elements or only one common element, both lists are empty.
