Output State: **times is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), check is 2147483647, stdin contains t-1 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by n non-negative integers (0 <= a_j < 2^31)**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `times`. Since `times` is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), this means that there are `times` test cases remaining in stdin, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` non-negative integers. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** 31 - 1` to `check`, which is equal to 2147483647. No other variables are affected.
