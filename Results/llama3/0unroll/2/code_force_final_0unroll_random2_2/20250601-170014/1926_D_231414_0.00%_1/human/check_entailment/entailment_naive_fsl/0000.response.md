Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

9
4
1 4 3 4
2
0 2147483647
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767

The program prints the answer for each test case, but it does not wait for the next test case to be input. It prints the answer for the first test case and then immediately starts processing the next test case without waiting for the input. This is because the print statement is inside the loop that processes the test cases.

To fix this, the print statement should be moved outside the loop that processes the test cases, so that it only prints the answer after all test cases have been processed.
