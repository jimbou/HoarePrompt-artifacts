Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n non-negative integers. For each test case, it processes the integers by performing bitwise XOR operations with a predefined value (2^31 - 1), and maintains a dictionary to keep track of the counts of these XOR results. The function then prints the number of integers that do not have a corresponding XOR pair in the dictionary. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, and then terminates.**
