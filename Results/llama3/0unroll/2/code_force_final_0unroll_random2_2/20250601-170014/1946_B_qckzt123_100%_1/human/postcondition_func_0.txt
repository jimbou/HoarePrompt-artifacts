This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates a value 'ans' based on these integers and prints it. The calculation involves summing the integers, finding the maximum sum of a subarray, and then performing a series of operations involving modular arithmetic. The function repeats this process for each test case and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
