Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is 0. In this case, the program should return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7, but the program does not handle this case correctly. It tries to calculate the maximum sum of the array after k operations, but since k is 0, no operations are performed, and the program should simply return the sum of the array. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and will produce an incorrect result.

For example, if the input is:

1
5 0
1 2 3 4 5

The program should return 15 (the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7), but it will produce an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
