Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the length of the array, the number of operations, and the array elements.

2. It calculates the sum of the array elements, which is used later in the calculation.

3. It finds the maximum sum of a subarray using Kadane's algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm for this problem. This maximum sum is used to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations.

4. The program then calculates the maximum possible sum after k operations by adding the sum of the array, the maximum sum of a subarray, and the result of k-1 operations of doubling the maximum sum of a subarray and taking the modulus. This calculation is correct based on the problem description.

5. Finally, the program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum possible sum after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Correctness: **True**
