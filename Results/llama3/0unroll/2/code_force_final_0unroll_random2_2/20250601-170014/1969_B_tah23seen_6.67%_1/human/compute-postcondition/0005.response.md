Functionality: **This function takes a string sChar consisting of only 0s and 1s as input, and returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the string. The function does not modify the original string sChar. It creates a list s consisting of the same characters as sChar, in the same order, and then performs a series of swaps on the list to move all '1's to the left of all '0's. The function returns the total number of swaps performed, which represents the minimum number of swaps required to achieve the desired arrangement.**
