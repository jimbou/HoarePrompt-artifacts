You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: s is a list consisting of the same characters as sChar, in the same order, and sChar remains unchanged.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: s is a list consisting of the same characters as sChar, in the same order, sChar remains unchanged, left is the length of s, cost is the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's, right is the length of s.
    return cost
    #The program returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the list `s` which consists of the same characters as `sChar` in the same order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the list `s` which consists of the same characters as `sChar` in the same order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
