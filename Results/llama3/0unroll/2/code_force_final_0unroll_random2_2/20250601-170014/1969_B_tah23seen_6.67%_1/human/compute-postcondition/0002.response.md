Output State: **s is a list consisting of the same characters as sChar, in the same order, sChar remains unchanged, left is 0, cost is 0, right is 1.**

The code snippet initializes three new variables: `left`, `cost`, and `right`, and assigns them the values 0, 0, and 1, respectively. The initial state of `s` and `sChar` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The final state includes the new variables and their assigned values, while maintaining the original state of `s` and `sChar`.
