#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s, and its length is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)

    #State: s is a list consisting of the same characters as sChar, in the same order, sChar remains unchanged, left is the length of s, cost is the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's, right is the length of s.
    return cost
    #The program returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the list `s` which consists of the same characters as `sChar` in the same order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string sChar consisting of only 0s and 1s as input, and returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the string. The function does not modify the original string sChar. It creates a list s consisting of the same characters as sChar, in the same order, and then performs a series of swaps on the list to move all '1's to the left of all '0's. The function returns the total number of swaps performed, which represents the minimum number of swaps required to achieve the desired arrangement.
