Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 3, but the correct answer is 2. The optimal strategy is to choose the substring "10" and perform a cyclic shift, resulting in the string "01", which is sorted in non-descending order.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the condition where the rightmost character is '0' and the leftmost character is '1', and swaps them if necessary. However, this approach does not consider all possible cases, such as the one mentioned above.

A correct approach would be to count the number of '1's in the string and then find the longest contiguous substring of '0's. The minimum cost would be the length of the string minus the length of the longest contiguous substring of '0's. This approach ensures that the string is sorted in non-descending order with the minimum number of operations.
