Reasoning: The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by cyclically shifting substrings. The program iterates through the string, swapping '1's and '0's when necessary, and increments the cost accordingly. The while loops are used to find the next '1' and '0' in the string, and the cost is incremented by the length of the substring that needs to be shifted. The program returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's, which is the minimum total cost to make the string sorted.

Correctness: **True**
