Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns the minimum cost.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s` of characters. This is done to allow for easier manipulation of the characters in the string.

2. The program then initializes three variables: `left` to 0, `cost` to 0, and `right` to 1. The `left` and `right` variables are used to track the current substring being considered, and the `cost` variable keeps track of the total cost of the operations performed.

3. The program then enters a while loop that continues until `right` is greater than or equal to the length of the string `s` or `left` is greater than or equal to the length of the string `s`. This loop is used to iterate over the string and find the substrings that need to be shifted.

4. Inside the loop, the program checks if the character at the `right` index is '0' and the character at the `left` index is '1'. If this condition is true, it swaps the characters at the `right` and `left` indices and increments the `cost` by the length of the substring being shifted (i.e., `right - left + 1`).

5. After swapping the characters, the program increments the `right` index until it finds a '0' character or reaches the end of the string. This is done to find the next substring that needs to be shifted.

6. The program then increments the `left` index until it finds a '1' character or reaches the end of the string. This is done to find the next substring that needs to be shifted.

7. The program repeats steps 4-6 until the loop condition is met.

8. Finally, the program returns the total cost of the operations performed.

Based on the analysis, the program seems to be correct. It correctly identifies the substrings that need to be shifted and calculates the minimum cost of the operations.

Correctness: **True**
