Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `sChar` as input and returns the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's in the string.

The function `func_1` works by iterating through the string from left to right, swapping '1's and '0's as necessary to maintain the non-descending order. The function keeps track of the number of swaps performed and returns this value as the minimum total cost.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the cyclic shift operation. The function swaps '1's and '0's in place, but it does not consider the cost of the swap operation, which is the length of the substring being swapped. The function also does not correctly handle the case where the substring being swapped contains multiple '1's and '0's.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
