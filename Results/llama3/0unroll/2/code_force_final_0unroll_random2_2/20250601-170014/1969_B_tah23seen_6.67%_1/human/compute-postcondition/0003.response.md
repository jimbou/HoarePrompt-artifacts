Output State: **s is a list consisting of the same characters as sChar, in the same order, sChar remains unchanged, left is the length of s, cost is the minimum number of swaps required to move all '1's to the left of all '0's, right is the length of s.**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The list s has been modified such that all '1's are to the left of all '0's, and the minimum number of swaps required to achieve this is stored in the variable cost. The variables left and right have reached the end of the list s, indicating that the loop has completed its task. The variable sChar remains unchanged, as it was not modified by the loop.
