The function reads a series of input pairs (n, k) from the standard input, where n and k are integers, and prints the result of a calculation for each pair. The result is 1 if n - k is greater than 1, and n otherwise. The function processes multiple input pairs, as specified by an initial integer t, and outputs the results in a series of integers.
