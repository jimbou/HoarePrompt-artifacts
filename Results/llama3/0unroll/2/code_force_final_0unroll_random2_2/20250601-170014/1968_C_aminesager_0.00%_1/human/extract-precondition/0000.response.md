Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). The second line contains n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500). The number of test cases does not exceed 10^4 and the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
