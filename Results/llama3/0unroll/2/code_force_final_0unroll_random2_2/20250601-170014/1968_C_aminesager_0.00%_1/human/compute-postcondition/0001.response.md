Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, where each integer represents the difference between the previous integer and the corresponding value in the input list T, in reverse order. The first integer in the list is 1000.**

In natural language, the output state is a list of integers that represents the result of subtracting each value in the input list T from the previous integer in the list, starting from 1000, and then reversing the list. For example, if the input list T is [3, 4, 5], the output state would be [1000, 997, 993, 988].
