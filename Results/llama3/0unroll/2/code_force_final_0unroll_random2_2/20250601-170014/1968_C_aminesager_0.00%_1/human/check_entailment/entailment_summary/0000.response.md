Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find any array a_1, ..., a_n that satisfies the given conditions. The program starts with a_1 = 1000 and then calculates each subsequent a_i by subtracting the corresponding x_i from the previous a_{i-1}. This ensures that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. The program then prints the resulting array in reverse order.

The program also correctly handles the constraints on the input values, such as 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. The output values are also within the allowed range of 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example output matches the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
