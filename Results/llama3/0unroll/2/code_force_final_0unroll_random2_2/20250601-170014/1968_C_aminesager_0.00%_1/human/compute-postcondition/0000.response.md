Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (2 <= n <= 500). The second line contains n-1 integers x_2,...,x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500). The number of test cases does not exceed 10^4 - 1 and the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 - n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned a positive integer value from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case, with each test case still consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` between 2 and 500, and the second line contains `n-1` integers between 1 and 500. The total number of test cases is reduced by 1, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases is also reduced by the value of `n` that was just read.
