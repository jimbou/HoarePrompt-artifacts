Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n-1 integers. It then calculates a new list of integers by subtracting each value in the input list from the previous value, starting from 1000, and prints the resulting list in reverse order. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
