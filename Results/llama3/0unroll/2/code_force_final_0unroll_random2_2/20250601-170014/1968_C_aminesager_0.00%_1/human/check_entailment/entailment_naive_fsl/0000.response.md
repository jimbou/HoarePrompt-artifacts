Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

5
4
2 4 1

The program will output:

3 5 4 9

However, this output does not satisfy the condition that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} for all 2 <= i <= n. Specifically, 2 = 5 mod 3 is not true.

The issue with the program is that it assumes that a_i can be calculated as a_{i-1} - x_i, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to find a_i such that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, which may require a different calculation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
