#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, a and b are positive integers such that k <= min(n, b).
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns a value that is a result of a calculation involving the variables k, n, a, and b. The calculation is k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a. Here, k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, and a and b are positive integers such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of n and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns a value based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b, where k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, and a and b are positive integers such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of n and b. The calculation involves a combination of multiplication, subtraction, and addition operations using these input parameters.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: low is 0, high is -1, max_profit is the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing func_1 with mid, n, a, and b as inputs, where mid is the value that maximizes the profit.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing func_1 with mid, n, a, and b as inputs, where mid is the value that maximizes the profit.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing another function, func_1, with a specific set of inputs. It takes four parameters: n, a, and b, which are integers within the range 1 to 10^9, and uses a binary search approach to find the optimal input value that maximizes the profit. The function iteratively adjusts the search range based on the profit values obtained from func_1 and returns the maximum profit found.
