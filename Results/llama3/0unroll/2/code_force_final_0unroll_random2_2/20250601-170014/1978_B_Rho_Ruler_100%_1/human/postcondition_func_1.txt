This function calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing another function, func_1, with a specific set of inputs. It takes four parameters: n, a, and b, which are integers within the range 1 to 10^9, and uses a binary search approach to find the optimal input value that maximizes the profit. The function iteratively adjusts the search range based on the profit values obtained from func_1 and returns the maximum profit found.
