Reasoning: 

The problem requires finding the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The profit is calculated based on the number of buns sold at a modified price and the number of buns sold at the usual price.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the profit for a given value of k, which is the number of buns sold at the modified price. The calculation involves a combination of multiplication, subtraction, and addition operations using the input parameters k, n, a, and b.

Function 2, `func_2`, uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit. It iteratively adjusts the search range based on the profit values obtained from `func_1` and returns the maximum profit found.

The execution summaries of the functions suggest that they are working as intended. `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for a given value of k, and `func_2` correctly uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k that maximizes the profit.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, it appears that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
