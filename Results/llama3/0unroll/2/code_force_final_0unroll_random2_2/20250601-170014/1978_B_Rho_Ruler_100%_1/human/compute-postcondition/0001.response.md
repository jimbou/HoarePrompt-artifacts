Output State: **low is 0, high is -1, max_profit is the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing func_1 with mid, n, a, and b as inputs, where mid is the value that maximizes the profit.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `low` variable remains at 0, the `high` variable is decremented to -1, and the `max_profit` variable is updated to the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing the `func_1` function with the optimal value of `mid`, `n`, `a`, and `b` as inputs. The optimal value of `mid` is the one that maximizes the profit.
