Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit that Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k, which is the number of buns sold at a modified price.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The `func_1` function calculates the profit for a given value of k. It takes into account the revenue from selling k buns at the modified price and the remaining (n-k) buns at the usual price. The formula used is correct, as it calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the modified price and adds the revenue from the remaining buns.

2. The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of k. It initializes the search range to [0, min(n, b)] and iteratively calculates the profit for the mid value of the range. It then compares the profit of the mid value with the profit of the next value (mid+1) and updates the search range accordingly.

3. The binary search approach is correct, as it takes advantage of the fact that the profit function is unimodal. This means that the profit increases as k increases up to a certain point and then decreases. By comparing the profit of the mid value with the profit of the next value, the program can determine whether the optimal value of k is in the left or right half of the search range.

4. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when k is 0 or when k is equal to min(n, b). In these cases, the program returns the correct profit value.

5. The program has a time complexity of O(log min(n, b)), which is efficient for large inputs.

Based on the above analysis, the program is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
