Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_2(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, a and b are positive integers such that k <= min(n, b).
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns a value that is a result of a calculation involving the variables k, n, a, and b. The calculation is k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a. Here, k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, and a and b are positive integers such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of n and b.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns a value based on the input parameters k, n, a, and b, where k is a non-negative integer, n is a positive integer, and a and b are positive integers such that k is less than or equal to the minimum of n and b. The calculation involves a combination of multiplication, subtraction, and addition operations using these input parameters.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: low is 0, high is -1, max_profit is the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing func_1 with mid, n, a, and b as inputs, where mid is the value that maximizes the profit.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing func_1 with mid, n, a, and b as inputs, where mid is the value that maximizes the profit.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be obtained by executing another function, func_1, with a specific set of inputs. It takes four parameters: n, a, and b, which are integers within the range 1 to 10^9, and uses a binary search approach to find the optimal input value that maximizes the profit. The function iteratively adjusts the search range based on the profit values obtained from func_1 and returns the maximum profit found.
