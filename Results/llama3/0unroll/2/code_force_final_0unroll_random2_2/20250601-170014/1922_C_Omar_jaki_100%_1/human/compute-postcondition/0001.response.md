Output State: **The output state is the sum of the differences between the squares of the differences between consecutive elements in the list of cities, for each query.**

In natural language, the output state is the sum of the differences between the squares of the differences between consecutive elements in the list of cities, for each query. The loop iterates over the list of cities, calculates the differences between consecutive elements, squares these differences, and sums them up. The result is then printed for each query.
