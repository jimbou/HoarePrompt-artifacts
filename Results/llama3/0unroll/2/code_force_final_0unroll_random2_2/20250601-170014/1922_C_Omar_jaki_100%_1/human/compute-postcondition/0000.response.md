Output State: **t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of unique integers in ascending order, an integer, and a list of pairs of unique integers. The list of integers are the coordinates of the cities, the integer is the number of queries, and the list of pairs of integers are the queries. The number of queries is a positive integer. The coordinates of the cities are non-negative integers. The queries are pairs of unique integers between 1 and the number of cities (inclusive).**

The code reads the first input from stdin, which is the number of cities, and assigns it to the variable `t`. This line affects the value of `t` and reduces the number of inputs in stdin by one. The remaining inputs in stdin are the list of city coordinates, the number of queries, and the list of queries. The code does not modify the values of these inputs.
