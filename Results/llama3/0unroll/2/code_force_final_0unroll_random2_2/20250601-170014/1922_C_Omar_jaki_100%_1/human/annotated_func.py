#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of unique integers in ascending order, then an integer, and then a list of pairs of unique integers. The first integer is the number of cities, the list of integers are the coordinates of the cities, the second integer is the number of queries, and the list of pairs of integers are the queries. The number of cities and the number of queries are both positive integers. The coordinates of the cities are non-negative integers. The queries are pairs of unique integers between 1 and the number of cities (inclusive).
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: The output state is the sum of the differences between the squares of the differences between consecutive elements in the list of cities, for each query.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. It calculates the sum of the differences between the squares of the differences between consecutive city coordinates, and then answers each query by printing the sum of these differences for the specified range of cities. The function processes all test cases and queries, and outputs the results for each query.
