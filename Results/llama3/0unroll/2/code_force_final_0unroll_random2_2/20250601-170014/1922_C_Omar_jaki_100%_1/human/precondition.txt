stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, then an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i. The integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are in ascending order, and for each city i, there is a unique closest city j. The integers x_i and y_i are between 1 and n (inclusive) and are not equal.
