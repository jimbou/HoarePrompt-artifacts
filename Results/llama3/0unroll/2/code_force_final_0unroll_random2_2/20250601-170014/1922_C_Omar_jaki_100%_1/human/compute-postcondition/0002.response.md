Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of city coordinates and a list of queries. It calculates the sum of the differences between the squares of the differences between consecutive city coordinates, and then answers each query by printing the sum of these differences for the specified range of cities. The function processes all test cases and queries, and outputs the results for each query.**
