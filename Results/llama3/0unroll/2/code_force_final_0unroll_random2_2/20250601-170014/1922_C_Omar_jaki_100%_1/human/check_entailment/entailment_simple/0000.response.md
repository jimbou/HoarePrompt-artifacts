Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of cities, the coordinates of the cities, the number of queries, and the queries themselves.

2. The program correctly initializes the list `b` to keep track of the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive cities. The list `b` is initialized with two zeros, which represents the cumulative sum for the first city.

3. The program correctly calculates the cumulative sum for each city. For each city, it calculates the difference between the current city and the next city, and adds this difference to the cumulative sum if the difference is greater than the difference between the current city and the previous city. This is done for both the forward and backward directions.

4. The program correctly handles the queries. For each query, it checks if the source city is less than the destination city. If it is, it calculates the minimum cost by subtracting the cumulative sum for the source city from the cumulative sum for the destination city. If the source city is not less than the destination city, it calculates the minimum cost by subtracting the cumulative sum for the destination city from the cumulative sum for the source city.

5. The program correctly prints the minimum cost for each query.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
