Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities based on the given conditions. The program uses a clever trick to calculate the sum of the differences between the squares of the differences between consecutive city coordinates, which allows it to efficiently answer each query. The program also correctly handles the case where the closest city is unique for each city, as stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
