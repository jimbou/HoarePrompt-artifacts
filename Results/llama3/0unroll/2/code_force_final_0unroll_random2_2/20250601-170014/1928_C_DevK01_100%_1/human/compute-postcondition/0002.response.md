Output State: **`q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < q, `M` is a list containing the integer square root of `q`, `w` is a float equal to the square root of `q`, and the current value of `w` is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been updated to include the integer square root of `q`, which is the current value of `w`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `q` still being an integer within the specified range, `x` being an integer less than `q`, and `w` being a float equal to the square root of `q` and an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
