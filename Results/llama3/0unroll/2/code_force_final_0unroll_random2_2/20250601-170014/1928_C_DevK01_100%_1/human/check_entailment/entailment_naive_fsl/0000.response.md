Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different k that fit under the given constraints. It first checks if the sum of the position and the number received during settling is even, and if not, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the possible values of k using the func_1 function, which finds the factors of a given number that are greater than or equal to x-1. The program then combines the results from two different cases (when n is less than 3x-2 and when n is greater than or equal to 3x-2) and prints the number of unique values of k.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases, including when n is less than 3x-2, when n is greater than or equal to 3x-2, and when the sum of the position and the number received during settling is odd. It also correctly calculates the factors of the given number and checks if they are greater than or equal to x-1.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
