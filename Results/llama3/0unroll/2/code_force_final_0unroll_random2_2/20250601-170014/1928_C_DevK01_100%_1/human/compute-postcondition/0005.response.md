Output State: **M contains all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1, and i is equal to w.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the list M will contain all the divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1. This includes both the divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of q (which were already in M initially if the square root of q is an integer greater than or equal to x - 1) and the divisors that are greater than the square root of q. The variable i will be equal to w, which is the upper limit of the loop.
