Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s. The function func_1 processes the string s, removes duplicate characters, and checks if the resulting string meets the length condition. If the length condition is not met, it constructs a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s by appending the missing character to the processed string.

The program also handles the case where the length of the processed string is greater than or equal to n times k, in which case it returns 'Yes'. If the length condition is not met, it returns 'No' followed by the constructed string.

Correctness: **True**
