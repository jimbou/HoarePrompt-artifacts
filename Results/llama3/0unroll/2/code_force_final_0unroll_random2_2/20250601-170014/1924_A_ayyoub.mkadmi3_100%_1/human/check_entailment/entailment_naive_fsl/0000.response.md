Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab

The program will output:

YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc

However, the correct output should be:

YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc
YES

The program fails to handle the case when the string s contains all possible substrings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets, but the string s itself is not a subsequence of the original string.

The issue lies in the func_1 function, which only checks if the string s contains all possible substrings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets, but does not check if the string s itself is a subsequence of the original string.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check if the string s itself is a subsequence of the original string, in addition to checking if it contains all possible substrings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets.
