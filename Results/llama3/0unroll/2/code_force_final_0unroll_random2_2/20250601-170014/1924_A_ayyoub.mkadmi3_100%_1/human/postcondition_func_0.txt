The function takes a string `s` and two integers `k` and `n` as input, where `s` consists of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and `1 <= k <= 26` and `1 <= n <= 26`. It processes the string `s` and returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the length of the processed string is greater than or equal to `n` times `k`, a substring of the processed string, and an empty string. The function effectively filters the input string, removes duplicate characters, and checks if the resulting string meets a certain length condition.
