Reasoning: The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The program handles the base cases correctly, where m is 0 or 1, and for m greater than 1, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

Correctness: **True**
