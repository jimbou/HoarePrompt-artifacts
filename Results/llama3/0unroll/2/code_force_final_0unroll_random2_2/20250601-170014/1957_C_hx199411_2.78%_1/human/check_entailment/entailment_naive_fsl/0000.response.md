Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves. The program first calculates the number of rows and columns that are blocked by the k moves, and then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it considers all possible ways to place the remaining rooks on the board, taking into account the fact that two rooks cannot be placed in the same row or column. The base cases for the dynamic programming are also correct, with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3, which correspond to the cases where there is only one or two rows/columns left to place the rooks.

The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one row/column left to place the rooks, in which case there is only one possible configuration. The program also correctly handles the case where there are no rows/columns left to place the rooks, in which case there are no possible configurations.

The program uses the modulo operation to avoid overflow, which is correct because the answer can be very large.

Overall, the program is correct because it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves, taking into account all possible ways to place the remaining rooks on the board.
