Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard. The program first calculates the number of remaining valid moves (m) by subtracting the number of moves already made (num) from the total number of moves (n). If m is 0, there are no valid moves left, so the program prints 0. If m is 1, there is only one valid move left, so the program prints 1. If m is greater than 1, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it considers all possible moves that can be made in the remaining valid moves. The base cases for the dynamic programming are correct, with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3. The recursive case is also correct, with dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7). This formula correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations by considering all possible moves that can be made in the remaining valid moves.

The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow. The final result is printed modulo 10^9 + 7, which is the required output format.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
