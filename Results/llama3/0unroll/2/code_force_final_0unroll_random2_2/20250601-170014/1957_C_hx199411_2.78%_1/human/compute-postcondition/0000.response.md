The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains t test cases, the first input is the number of test cases, which is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 0 <= k <= n) and k pairs of integers r_i and c_i (1 <= r_i, c_i <= n) such that no two pairs have the same row or column and no pair has r_i = c_i.**
