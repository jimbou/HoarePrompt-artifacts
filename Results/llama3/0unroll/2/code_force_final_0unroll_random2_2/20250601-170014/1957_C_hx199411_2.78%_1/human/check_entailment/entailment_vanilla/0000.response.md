Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2.  For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
3.  It then reads the coordinates of the `k` moves played so far.
4.  For each move, it checks if the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`). If it is, it increments the `num` variable by 1. Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2. This is because a move on the diagonal only blocks one position, while a move off the diagonal blocks two positions.
5.  After reading all the moves, it calculates the number of remaining positions on the board `m` by subtracting `num` from `n`.
6.  If `m` is 0, it means there are no more valid moves left, so it prints 0.
7.  If `m` is 1, it means there is only one valid move left, so it prints 1.
8.  If `m` is greater than 1, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. It initializes a list `dp` of size `m + 1` with all elements set to 0. It then sets `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3.
9.  For `i` ranging from 3 to `m`, it calculates `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This recurrence relation is based on the fact that for each position, there are two possibilities: either a rook is placed in that position, or it is not. If a rook is placed, there are `i - 1` ways to place the remaining rooks. If no rook is placed, there are `dp[i - 2]` ways to place the remaining rooks.
10. Finally, it prints the value of `dp[m]`, which represents the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
