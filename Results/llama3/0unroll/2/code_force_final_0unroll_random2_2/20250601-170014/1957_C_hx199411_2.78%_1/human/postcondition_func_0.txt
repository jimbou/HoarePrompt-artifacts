This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints output to standard output. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers n and k, followed by k pairs of integers. It then calculates the value of m based on the input and prints a value based on the value of m. If m is 0, it prints 0. If m is 1, it prints 1. If m is greater than 1, it calculates a value using dynamic programming and prints the result modulo 10^9 + 7. The function repeats this process for each test case.
