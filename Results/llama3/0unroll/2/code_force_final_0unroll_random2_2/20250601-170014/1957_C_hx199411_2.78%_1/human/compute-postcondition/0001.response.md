Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the final state of the variables t, n, k, num, m, and dp.**

In natural language, the output state is the final result of the loop's execution, which includes the remaining number of test cases (t), the size of the grid (n), the number of pairs (k), the number of pairs with the same row or column (num), the number of remaining cells (m), and the dynamic programming array (dp) used to calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining cells.
