Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win the game if Alice and Bob play optimally. The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The provided program reads the input data, counts the number of 'U' characters in each string, and prints 'YES' if the count is odd and 'NO' if the count is even. This approach is based on the fact that if the number of 'U' characters is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of 'U' characters, ultimately forcing Bob to lose. Conversely, if the number of 'U' characters is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with an even number of 'U' characters, ultimately forcing Alice to lose.

The execution summary confirms that the program correctly reads the input data, counts the 'U' characters, and prints the results based on the parity of the count.

Correctness: **True**
