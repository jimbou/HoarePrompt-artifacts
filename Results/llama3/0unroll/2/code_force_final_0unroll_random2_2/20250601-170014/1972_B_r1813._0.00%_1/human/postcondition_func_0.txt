This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and a string of that length containing only 'U' and 'D' characters. It then determines whether the number of 'U' characters in each string is odd or even and prints 'YES' for odd counts and 'NO' for even counts. The function processes all test cases and prints the results in the order they were received.
