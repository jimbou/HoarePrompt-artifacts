Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines which letter appears most frequently in a given string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It iterates through each character in the string, incrementing a counter for 'A' or 'B' accordingly. After counting, it compares the counts and prints the letter that appears most frequently.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Strings with more 'A's than 'B's
* Strings with more 'B's than 'A's
* Strings with equal numbers of 'A's and 'B's (in which case it prints 'B')

The program also handles the constraints specified in the problem description, such as the input string being of length 5 and consisting only of letters 'A' and 'B'.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
