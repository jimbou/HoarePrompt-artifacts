Functionality: **This function reads a series of input strings from standard input, each consisting of the letters A and B, and prints the dominant letter in each string. The number of input strings is specified by the first input, an integer t. The function outputs a sequence of 'A's and 'B's, each representing the dominant letter in the corresponding input string, without modifying the original input strings or the value of t.**
