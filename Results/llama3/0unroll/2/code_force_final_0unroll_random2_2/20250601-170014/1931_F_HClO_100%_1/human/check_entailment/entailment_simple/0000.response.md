Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to in a programming contest chat. The program takes multiple test cases as input, where each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers.

The program first checks if the number of screenshots (m) is 1, in which case it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. If m is greater than 1, it reads the first two screenshots and checks if the lists of participants (excluding the authors) are equal. If they are not equal, it prints 'no' and continues to the next test case.

If the lists are equal, the program then checks for the indices where the authors of the screenshots are located in the lists. It uses these indices to insert the authors into the lists and creates a new list (l) that represents the order of participants.

The program then reads the remaining screenshots and checks if the lists of participants (excluding the authors) are equal to the list (l). If any of the lists are not equal, it prints 'no'. If all lists are equal, it prints 'yes'.

The program uses a loop to iterate over the test cases and prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
