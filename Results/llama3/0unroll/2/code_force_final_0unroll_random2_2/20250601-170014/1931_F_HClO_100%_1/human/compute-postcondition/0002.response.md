Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines of n integers. It checks if the rows can be made identical by inserting a specific element into one of the rows and prints 'yes' or 'no' to the console for each test case, indicating whether the condition is satisfied. The function consumes all input test cases and does not retain any information from the input.**
