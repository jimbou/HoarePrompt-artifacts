Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'yes' or 'no' printed to the console, indicating whether the input test cases satisfy the condition of having identical rows after inserting a specific element into one of the rows. The number of 'yes' or 'no' printed is equal to the number of test cases (t) provided in the initial state. The input test cases are consumed and not retained in the output state.**
