Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when there are more than two screenshots and the order of participants is not consistent across all screenshots. The program only checks the consistency of the order between the first two screenshots and then assumes that the order is consistent across all screenshots. However, this assumption is not always true.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly output "yes" because it only checks the consistency of the order between the first two screenshots, which is consistent. However, the order of participants is not consistent across all three screenshots.

To fix this bug, the program needs to check the consistency of the order across all screenshots, not just the first two. This can be done by iterating over all screenshots and checking if the order of participants is consistent with the order in the first screenshot. If the order is not consistent, the program should output "no".
