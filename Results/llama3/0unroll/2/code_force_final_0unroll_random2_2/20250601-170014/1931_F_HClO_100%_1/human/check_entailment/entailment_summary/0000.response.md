Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if there is a certain order that all screenshots correspond to. The program first checks if the number of screenshots (m) is 1, in which case it prints 'yes' because there is only one possible order. If m is greater than 1, it reads the first two screenshots and checks if they can be made identical by inserting a specific element into one of the rows. If they cannot be made identical, it prints 'no'. If they can be made identical, it reads the remaining screenshots and checks if they match the modified row. If any of the remaining screenshots do not match, it prints 'no'. If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.

Correctness: **True**
