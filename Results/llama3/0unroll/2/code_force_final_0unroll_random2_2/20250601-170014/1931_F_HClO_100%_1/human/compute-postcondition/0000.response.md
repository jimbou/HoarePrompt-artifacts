The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first integer read from stdin is the number of test cases, which is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case contains two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n * k <= 2 * 10^5) followed by k lines, each containing n integers a_ij (1 <= a_ij <= n, all a_ij are different).**
