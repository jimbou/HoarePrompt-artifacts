Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the variable `num` has been assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^5. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), as the first input (the integer n) has already been read and assigned to `num`.
