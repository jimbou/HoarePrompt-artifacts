Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer 'n' and 'n' integers. If 'n' is greater than 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it calculates the median of the 'n' integers, increments the median by 1 until it is greater than the original median, and prints the number of increments. The function repeats this process for each test case until it has processed all test cases or until it encounters a test case with 'n' greater than 10000.**
