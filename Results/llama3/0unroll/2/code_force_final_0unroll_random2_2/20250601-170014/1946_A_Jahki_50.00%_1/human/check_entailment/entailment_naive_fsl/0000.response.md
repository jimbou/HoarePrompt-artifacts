Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array has duplicate medians. In such cases, the program will incorrectly increment the median multiple times, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input array [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]. The median of this array is 5. However, the program will increment the median multiple times, resulting in an incorrect output.

To fix this issue, the program should only increment the median until it is greater than the original median, and then stop. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check if the new median is greater than the original median, and if so, break the loop.

Here is the corrected code:
```
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        op = 0
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
            if new_median > median:
                break
        print(op)
```
With this correction, the program should work correctly for all input cases.
