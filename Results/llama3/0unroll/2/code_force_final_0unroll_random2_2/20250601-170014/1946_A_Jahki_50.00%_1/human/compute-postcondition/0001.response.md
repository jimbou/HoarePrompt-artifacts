Output State: **The loop will iterate 'num' times, where 'num' is an integer between 1 and 10^5. In each iteration, it will read an integer 'num2' and a string 'case' from the standard input. If 'num2' is greater than 10000, it will print 1 and 16668, and then break out of the loop. Otherwise, it will split the string 'case' into a list of integers 'a', sort 'a' in ascending order, and calculate the median 'median'. It will then increment the median by 1 until it is greater than the original median, keeping track of the number of increments 'op'. Finally, it will print 'op'. The loop will continue until it has iterated 'num' times or until 'num2' is greater than 10000.**
