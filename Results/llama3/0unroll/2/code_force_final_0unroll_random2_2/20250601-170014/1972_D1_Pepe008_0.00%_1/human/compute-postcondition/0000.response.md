Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `T = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads the first line from stdin, which contains a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4).
	* `int()` converts the input string to an integer.
	* The result is assigned to the variable `T`.

Since the first line of stdin is consumed, the remaining lines contain `t` pairs of positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 10^4), stdin contains T lines, each containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**
