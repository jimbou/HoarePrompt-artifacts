Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. The issue lies in the calculation of the variable `x`. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is incorrect and does not accurately represent the number of valid pairs for each value of `i`.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if the conditions are met, or finding a more efficient mathematical formula that accurately represents the number of valid pairs.

For example, for the input `n = 10, m = 8`, the program outputs `13`, but the correct output is `14`. This is because the program is not correctly counting the number of valid pairs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
