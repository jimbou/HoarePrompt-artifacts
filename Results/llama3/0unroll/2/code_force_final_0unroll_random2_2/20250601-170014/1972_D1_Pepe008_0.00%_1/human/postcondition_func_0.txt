This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains a positive integer T (1 <= T <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and calculates the sum of the number of pairs (i, j) where i is a positive integer less than or equal to n, and j is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to m, such that (j+i) is divisible by the greatest common divisor of i and j. The function then prints the calculated sum for each test case, minus 1.
