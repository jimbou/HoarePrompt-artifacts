Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
2. a + b is a multiple of b \* gcd(a, b)

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases T and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads two integers a and b, which represent the upper bounds for a and b, respectively.
3.  The program then calculates the sum of valid pairs using a single loop that iterates over the range from 1 to b (inclusive).
4.  Inside the loop, it calculates the value of x using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This formula is derived from the condition that a + b must be a multiple of b \* gcd(a, b).
5.  If the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` is true, it adds the value of x to the sum `suma`.
6.  Finally, the program prints the value of `suma - 1` as the result.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The formula used to calculate x is incorrect. The correct formula should be derived from the condition that a + b is a multiple of b \* gcd(a, b), which is equivalent to a being a multiple of gcd(a, b).

A correct approach would be to iterate over the possible values of gcd(a, b) and calculate the number of valid pairs for each gcd value. This can be done using the following formula:

`valid_pairs = sum((a // gcd) * (b // gcd) for gcd in range(1, min(a, b) + 1))`

This formula calculates the number of valid pairs for each gcd value by dividing a and b by the gcd and multiplying the results.

Therefore, the provided Python program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
