Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when x is a multiple of 15 and y is greater than 0. In this case, the program will print a value that is one more than the actual minimum number of screens needed.

For example, if x = 15 and y = 1, the program will print 2, but the correct answer is 1. This is because the 15 1x1 icons can fit in one screen, and the 2x2 icon can fit in the remaining space of the same screen.

The issue is with the line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`. This line assumes that if x is greater than 0, it will always require at least one more screen. However, this is not true when x is a multiple of 15, because in that case, the 1x1 icons can fit exactly in one screen, and the 2x2 icon can fit in the remaining space of the same screen.
