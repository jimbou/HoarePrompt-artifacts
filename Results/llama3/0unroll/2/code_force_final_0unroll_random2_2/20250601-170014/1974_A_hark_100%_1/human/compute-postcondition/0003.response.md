Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. It calculates the total number of icons that can be placed on the screen based on the provided numbers and prints the result to the console. The function handles four possible scenarios: both 1x1 and 2x2 icons are present, only 2x2 icons are present, only 1x1 icons are present, and neither type of icon is present. The function iterates over the specified number of test cases, processing each one independently and printing the corresponding output.**
