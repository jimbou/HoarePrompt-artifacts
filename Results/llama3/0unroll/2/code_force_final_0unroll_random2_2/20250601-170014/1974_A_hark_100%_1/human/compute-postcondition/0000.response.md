The code accepts an input and assigns it to `ap`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a series of lines, each containing two integers (the number of 1x1 icons and the number of 2x2 icons) separated by a space. The number of test cases is a positive integer and the number of icons are non-negative integers less than or equal to 99. So `ap` is assigned the value of the number of test cases which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains a series of lines, each containing two integers (the number of 1x1 icons and the number of 2x2 icons) separated by a space. The number of icons are non-negative integers less than or equal to 99.

Output State: **`ap` is a positive integer, stdin contains a series of lines, each containing two integers (the number of 1x1 icons and the number of 2x2 icons) separated by a space. The number of icons are non-negative integers less than or equal to 99.**
