Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, 0 <= `m` <= min(10^5, `n`*(`n`-1)/2), 1 <= `k` <= 2*10^5. `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`, `a` != `b`, and 1 <= `f` <= 10^9. `t` is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only added a new variable `t`, which is assigned the value of an integer input from the user. The stdin now contains no input as it has been consumed by the `input()` function.
