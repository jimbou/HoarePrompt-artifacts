Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate this expected value, which takes as input the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, the number of excursions `k`, and a list of friendships where each friendship is represented as a tuple of three integers `(a, b, f)`.

The function `func_1` calculates the expected value by iterating over each friendship and adding the product of the friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` positive integers (i.e., `k * (k + 1) // 2`) to the result. The result is then taken modulo `MOD` to ensure that it fits within the range of a 32-bit integer.

The function `func_2` reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendships from the standard input, calls `func_1` with these values, and prints the result.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, which is the sum of the products of the friendship values and the sum of the first `k` positive integers. The use of modulo arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the range of a 32-bit integer.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not take into account the fact that the friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0 and does not change for subsequent excursions. This means that the program is not accurately modeling the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
