Functionality: **This function calculates the sum of a weighted value for each friendship in a list, where the weight is determined by a formula involving a positive integer k and a modulus value MOD. The function takes in parameters n, m, k, and friendships, where n and m are non-negative integers, k is a positive integer, and friendships is a list of 3-element tuples containing integers a, b, and f. The function returns the sum of f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD for all tuples in friendships, taken modulo MOD. The function does not modify the input variables n, m, k, or friendships.**
