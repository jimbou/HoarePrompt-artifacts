The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`, where `n` and `m` are integers, `k` is an integer, and `friendships` is a list of lists containing three integers each. The function processes the input values and returns a result, which is then printed as output. The function's purpose is to perform some operation on the input values and produce an output based on the processed data. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the output of the function is printed, and the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged.
