Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving friendships and excursions. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Function 1 calculates the sum of a weighted value for each friendship in a list, where the weight is determined by a formula involving a positive integer k and a modulus value MOD. However, this function does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated by considering the probability of each pair being chosen, which is 1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2), where n is the number of children.

Function 2 reads input values for n, m, k, and friendships, and then calls Function 1 to calculate the result. However, since Function 1 does not correctly calculate the expected value, the overall program does not meet the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
