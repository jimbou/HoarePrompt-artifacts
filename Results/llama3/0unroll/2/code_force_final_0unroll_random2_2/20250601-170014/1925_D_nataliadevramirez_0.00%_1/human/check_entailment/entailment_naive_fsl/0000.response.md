Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not take into account the probability of choosing a pair of friends in each excursion.

In the problem description, it is mentioned that the teacher chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. This means that the probability of choosing a pair of friends is not constant and changes after each excursion.

The program, however, calculates the result as if the probability of choosing a pair of friends is constant and equal to the initial friendship value. This is incorrect because the probability of choosing a pair of friends changes after each excursion.

For example, consider the case where there are 2 children, 1 pair of friends with an initial friendship value of 1, and 2 excursions. The program would calculate the result as 1 * (2 * (2 + 1) // 2) % MOD = 3. However, the correct result is 1 * (1/2) + 2 * (1/2) = 3/2, which is not equal to 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
