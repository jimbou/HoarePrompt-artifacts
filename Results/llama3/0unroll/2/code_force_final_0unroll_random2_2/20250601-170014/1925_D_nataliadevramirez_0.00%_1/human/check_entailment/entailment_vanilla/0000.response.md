Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The given program attempts to solve this problem using two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for a given set of friendships. It iterates over each friendship, calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for that friendship, and adds it to the total result.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1.  The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of choosing each pair of friends, which is not taken into account in the program.
2.  The program does not handle the case where a pair of friends is chosen more than once. In this case, the friendship value should increase by 1 for each subsequent excursion, but the program does not account for this.
3.  The program uses a modulo operation (`% MOD`) to prevent overflow, but it does not define the value of `MOD`. This could lead to incorrect results if `MOD` is not properly defined.

`func_2` reads the input data, calls `func_1` to calculate the result, and prints the result. However, due to the issues with `func_1`, the results printed by `func_2` will also be incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
