Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be the result of the last iteration of the loop, which is the output of the function `func_1` with the last set of input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` will be the last values read from the input, and the value of `t` will be the number of iterations of the loop. The state of other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged.
