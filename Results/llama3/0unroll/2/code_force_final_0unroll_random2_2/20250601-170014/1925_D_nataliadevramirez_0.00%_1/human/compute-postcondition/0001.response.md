Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of `t` results, where each result is the output of the function `func_1` for the corresponding input values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are updated in each iteration of the loop, but the values of other variables in the initial state that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
