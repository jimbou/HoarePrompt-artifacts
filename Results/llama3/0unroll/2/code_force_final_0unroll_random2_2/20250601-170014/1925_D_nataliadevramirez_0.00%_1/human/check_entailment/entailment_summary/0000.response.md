Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` calculates the sum of a weighted value for each friendship in a list, where the weight is determined by a formula involving a positive integer k and a modulus value MOD. The function takes in parameters n, m, k, and friendships, where n and m are non-negative integers, k is a positive integer, and friendships is a list of 3-element tuples containing integers a, b, and f.

`func_2` is the main function that reads input from the user, processes it, and prints the result. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions. It also reads the list of friendships, where each friendship is represented by a list of three integers: the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. It then calls `func_1` with the input values and prints the result.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The formula used in `func_1` to calculate the weighted value for each friendship is correct, and the program correctly reads and processes the input values. The use of the modulus value MOD ensures that the result is within the required range.

However, the program does not fully meet the problem description. The problem description requires the calculation of the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions, taking into account the increase in friendship value for each pair of friends chosen. The program does not account for this increase in friendship value.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
