The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `n`. Since the stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, the value of `n` is now equal to `t`. The stdin now contains `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `n` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.**
