Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles all possible cases as described in the problem description. It checks if the length of the set of characters in the string is equal to 1, which means all characters are the same. If so, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

If the length of the set of characters is not equal to 1, it prints 'YES' and then prints the sorted string in ascending or descending order, depending on whether the original string is already sorted in ascending order. This ensures that the rearranged string is not equal to the original string.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including strings with all the same characters, strings with only two unique characters, and strings with multiple unique characters. It also handles strings of length 1, where it's impossible to rearrange the characters to form a new string that is not equal to the original string.

Overall, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
