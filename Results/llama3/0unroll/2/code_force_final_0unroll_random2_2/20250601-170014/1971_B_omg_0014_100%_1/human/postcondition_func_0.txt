This function reads a series of strings from standard input, checks if each string has all unique characters, and prints 'NO' if it does not. If a string has unique characters, it prints 'YES' followed by the string sorted in ascending order if it was already sorted, otherwise it prints the string sorted in descending order. The function processes a number of strings specified by the first input integer.
