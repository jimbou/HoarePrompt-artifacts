Functionality: **This function determines the smallest integer i such that i * n >= n, where n is a positive integer, and then iterates from 1 to n // k, printing lines in the format '? l i * v' and '! i * v' for each iteration. If the loop completes without finding a match, it prints '! -1' and returns without a value. The function performs a series of print statements and function calls, but does not modify or return any values.**
