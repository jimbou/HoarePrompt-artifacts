Output: **The loop will execute for a total of n // k iterations, and in each iteration, it will print n // k number of lines in the format '? l i * v' where l ranges from 1 to n // k + 1. After each iteration, it will print a line in the format '! i * v' and then call func_2() and return. The final output state will be the last printed line '! i * v' where i is the last value of the loop variable, which is n // k, and the line '! -1' is printed**
