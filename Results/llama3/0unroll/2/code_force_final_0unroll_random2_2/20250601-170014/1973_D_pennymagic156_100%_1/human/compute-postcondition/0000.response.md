Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, v is 1**

The code snippet provided assigns new values to `n` and `k` using the function `func_3()`, and initializes a new variable `v` with the value 1. The function `func_3()` is not defined in the given code, so we assume it returns two positive integers that satisfy the condition 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. The variable `v` is introduced with a value of 1. The initial state's constraints on `n` and `k` are preserved, as the new values assigned by `func_3()` also adhere to the same constraints.
