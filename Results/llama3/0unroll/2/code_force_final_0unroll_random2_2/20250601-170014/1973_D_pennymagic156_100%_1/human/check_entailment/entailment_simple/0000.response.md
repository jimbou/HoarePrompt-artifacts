Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} such that 1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m.

The program first finds the smallest integer i such that i * n >= n, which is the maximum possible value of m. Then, it iterates over all possible values of m from n // k to 1, and for each m, it checks if it is possible to split the array into exactly k subarrays such that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to m. If it finds such an m, it prints the answer and returns. If it doesn't find any such m, it prints -1 and returns.

The program correctly handles the case where k = 1, and it also correctly handles the case where no such m exists.

Correctness: **True**
