Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} such that 1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m. The program also correctly handles the case where no such m exists.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the length of the hidden array n and the number of subarrays k. It then performs a binary search to find the largest value m such that there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} such that 1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n and f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m.

The program uses the functions func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4 to read input from the user and perform calculations. The function func_5 is the main function that implements the game logic.

The program correctly handles the case where no such m exists by printing '! -1' and returning without a value.

Correctness: **True**
