The code `T = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. Since `T` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `T` is equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **`T` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
