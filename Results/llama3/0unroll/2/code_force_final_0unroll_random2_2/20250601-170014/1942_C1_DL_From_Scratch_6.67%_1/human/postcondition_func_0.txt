The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, and the second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers, counts the number of pairs of consecutive integers, and prints the count plus x - 2. The function executes this process for the specified number of test cases T, without modifying the initial state except for the printed output.
