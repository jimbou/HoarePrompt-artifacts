This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then analyzes each list to find subsequences of three numbers (a, b, c) where a < b < c and the difference between a and c is greater than or equal to the difference between b and c. The function counts the number of such subsequences in each list and prints the count for each test case.
