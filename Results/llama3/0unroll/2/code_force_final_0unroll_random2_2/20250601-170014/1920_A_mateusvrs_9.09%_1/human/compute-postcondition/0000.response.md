Output State: **t is an integer, r is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer**.

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case starts with an integer, `t` will be an integer between 2 and 100. The second line initializes an empty list `r`. No other variables are affected. The value of `t` is used to determine the number of test cases, and the list `r` is initially empty.
