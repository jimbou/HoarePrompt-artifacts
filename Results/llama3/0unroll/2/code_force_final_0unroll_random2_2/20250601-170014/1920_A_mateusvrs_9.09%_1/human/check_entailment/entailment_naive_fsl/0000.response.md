Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It correctly handles the three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x;
2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x;
3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

The program initializes the minimum and maximum possible values of k (bx and ax) and a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to (cx). It then iterates through each constraint, updating bx and ax accordingly, and adding values to cx when necessary.

After processing all constraints, the program checks if bx is greater than or equal to ax, which would indicate that there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints. If this is the case, it appends 0 to the result list.

Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting bx from ax, adding 1, and then subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax]. This is because these values are not allowed, so they need to be subtracted from the total count.

The program then appends this calculated value to the result list.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
