Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program initializes `ax` to a large value (1000000000.0 + 7) and `bx` to -1. This is done to ensure that the first constraint of type 1 and type 2 will update these values correctly.

2. The program then iterates over each constraint. If the constraint is of type 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and the value `x`. This ensures that `bx` will be the maximum value of `x` for all type 1 constraints.

3. If the constraint is of type 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and the value `x`. This ensures that `ax` will be the minimum value of `x` for all type 2 constraints.

4. If the constraint is of type 3, it adds the value `x` to the set `cx`. This is done to keep track of all the values that `k` cannot be equal to.

5. After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is the case, it means that there are no possible values for `k` that satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list.

6. Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values for `k` by subtracting `bx` from `ax` and adding 1 (to include both `bx` and `ax` in the count), and then subtracting the number of values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`. This is done to exclude the values that `k` cannot be equal to.

7. Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases, one per line.

Correctness: **True**
