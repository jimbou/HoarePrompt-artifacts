Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9). There exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2. No two constraints are the exact same.**
