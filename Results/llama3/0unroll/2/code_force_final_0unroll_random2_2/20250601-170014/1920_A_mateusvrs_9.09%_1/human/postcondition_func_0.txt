This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n followed by n lines of two integers a and x. It processes each test case by finding the maximum value of x for constraints of type 1, the minimum value of x for constraints of type 2, and a set of x values for constraints of type 3. If the maximum value of x for type 1 constraints is greater than or equal to the minimum value of x for type 2 constraints, it outputs 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range from the maximum value of x for type 1 constraints to the minimum value of x for type 2 constraints, excluding the x values for type 3 constraints, and outputs this count. The function repeats this process for all test cases and prints the results, one per line.
