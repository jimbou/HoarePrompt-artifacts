You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of pairs of integers and secondary_heap is a list of pairs of integers, such that the pairs in both lists represent the prices of items for Alice and Bob respectively.
    total = sum(item[0] for item in secondary_heap)
    for item in primary_items:
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            total += item[0] + item[1]
        
    #State: Output State: The total sum of prices of items in the secondary heap for Bob has increased by the sum of the prices of items in the primary list that have a total price greater than or equal to 0. The primary list and secondary heap remain unchanged.
    return total
    #The program returns the total sum of prices of items in the secondary heap for Bob, which has increased by the sum of the prices of items in the primary list that have a total price greater than or equal to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total sum of prices of items in the secondary heap for Bob, which has increased by the sum of the prices of items in the primary list that have a total price greater than or equal to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
