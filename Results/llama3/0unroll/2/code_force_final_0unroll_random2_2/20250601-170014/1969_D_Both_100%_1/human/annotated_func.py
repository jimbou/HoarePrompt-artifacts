#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    return int(read_input())
    #The program returns an integer that is greater than 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer from standard input and returns it, ensuring the returned value is greater than 0.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: read_input() returns a string containing a space-separated list of integers.
    return map(int, read_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains a sequence of integers, where each integer is a result of converting a string from the space-separated list of integers returned by read_input() to an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and returns a map object containing a sequence of integers. It reads a string of space-separated integers, splits the string into individual integers, and converts each integer string to an integer. The function returns a map object containing these converted integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of pairs of integers and secondary_heap is a list of pairs of integers, such that the pairs in both lists represent the prices of items for Alice and Bob respectively.

    return total
    #The program returns the total sum of prices of items in the secondary heap for Bob, which has increased by the sum of the prices of items in the primary list that have a total price greater than or equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates the total sum of prices of items in the secondary heap for Bob, and then adds the sum of prices of items in the primary list that have a total price greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this updated total sum, leaving the primary list and secondary heap unchanged.

    #State: Output State: `combined` is a list of tuples of two integers, `heap` is a list of tuples of two integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit obtained after all iterations of the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained by processing a list of items with negative prices and bonuses. It takes no input parameters and returns the maximum profit. The function iterates over a list of test cases, and for each test case, it initializes an empty heap and a list of remaining items. It then generates a list of prices and bonuses, combines them into a list of tuples, and sorts the list based on the bonuses. The function pushes the top k items from the sorted list into the heap and calculates the initial profit. It then iterates over the remaining items, updating the profit and the heap accordingly. The function keeps track of the maximum profit obtained during the iterations and returns it as the output.
