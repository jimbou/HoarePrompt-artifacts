Output State: **`combined` is a list of tuples of two integers, `heap` is a list of tuples of two integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`**

In this output state, the values of `combined`, `heap`, and `k` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only assigns the return value of `func_1()` to the new variable `test_cases`. The return value of `func_1()` is now stored in `test_cases`, but its specific value is unknown since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided.
