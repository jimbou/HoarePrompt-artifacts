Functionality: **This function calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained by processing a list of items with negative prices and bonuses. It takes no input parameters and returns the maximum profit. The function iterates over a list of test cases, and for each test case, it initializes an empty heap and a list of remaining items. It then generates a list of prices and bonuses, combines them into a list of tuples, and sorts the list based on the bonuses. The function pushes the top k items from the sorted list into the heap and calculates the initial profit. It then iterates over the remaining items, updating the profit and the heap accordingly. The function keeps track of the maximum profit obtained during the iterations and returns it as the output.**
