Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to maximize Alice's profit and minimize Bob's profit. The program uses a heap to keep track of the items that Bob will take for free, and it iteratively adds and removes items from the heap to maximize Alice's profit.

The program first reads the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads the number of items `n` and the number of items Bob will take for free `k`. It then reads the prices of the items for Alice and Bob, and combines them into a list of tuples.

The program then sorts the combined list based on the prices for Bob, and pushes the first `k` items into the heap. It then calculates the initial profit by calling `func_3`, which calculates the total sum of prices of items in the secondary heap for Bob, increased by the sum of the prices of items in the primary list that have a total price greater than or equal to 0.

The program then iteratively pops an item from the combined list, updates the current profit, and pushes the popped item into the heap. It then calculates the new profit by calling `func_3` again, and updates the maximum profit if the new profit is greater.

Finally, the program prints the maximum profit obtained after all iterations of the loop.

Correctness: **True**
