Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to cut a binary string into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program iterates through the string, incrementing the count whenever it encounters a change in the character (from '0' to '1' or vice versa). If it encounters a '0' followed by a '1', it sets a flag to True and increments the count. After the loop, if the flag is True, it decrements the count by 1.

This logic correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings that are already sorted (e.g. "00000000" or "11111111")
* Strings that have a single change in character (e.g. "10" or "01")
* Strings that have multiple changes in character (e.g. "11010" or "0110")

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as strings of length 1 (e.g. "0" or "1").

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected.
