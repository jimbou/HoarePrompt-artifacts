The code `numCases = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) followed by t test cases. Since the first integer is assigned to `numCases`, the stdin now contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

Output State: **`numCases` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains `numCases` test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**
