Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It then sorts the integers in ascending order, pairs them up, and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair. The function prints the sum for each test case, resulting in numCases number of integers being output to standard output. The function does not modify the input values or store any results internally, and it does not perform any actions other than reading input, processing the data, and printing the output.**
