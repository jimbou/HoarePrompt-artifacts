Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the correct number of test cases and integers for each test case.
2. It sorts the integers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the maximum final score.
3. It pairs up the integers and calculates the sum of the minimum value in each pair, which is the correct approach to find the maximum final score.
4. It prints the sum for each test case, which is the expected output.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to find the maximum final score. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
