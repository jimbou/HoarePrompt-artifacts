Determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two players, Alice and Bob, on a grid. The function takes no arguments but reads input from stdin, expecting six space-separated integers: the height and width of the grid, and the x and y coordinates of Alice and Bob. It then prints 'draw' if the players are in the same column, 'Alice' if the difference between their x-coordinates is odd and they are not in the same row, or 'Bob' if the difference between their x-coordinates is even and they are in the same row. The function does not return any value.
