#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of six space-separated integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers. x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two players, Alice and Bob, on a grid. The function takes no arguments but reads input from stdin, expecting six space-separated integers: the height and width of the grid, and the x and y coordinates of Alice and Bob. It then prints 'draw' if the players are in the same column, 'Alice' if the difference between their x-coordinates is odd and they are not in the same row, or 'Bob' if the difference between their x-coordinates is even and they are in the same row. The function does not return any value.
