Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice's chip is in the last row (x_a = h) and Bob's chip is in the first row (x_b = 1). In this case, the game should end in a draw, but the program does not check for this condition.

For example, if the input is:

6 5 6 2 1 3

The program will output "Alice", but the correct output should be "Draw" because Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, and neither player can make a move.

The program only checks if x2 <= x1 or if (x2 - x1) % 2 != 0, but it does not check if x_a = h or x_b = 1, which is a necessary condition to determine the outcome of the game.
