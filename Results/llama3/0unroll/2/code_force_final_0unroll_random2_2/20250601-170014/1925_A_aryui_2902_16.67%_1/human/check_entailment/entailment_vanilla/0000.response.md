Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1`.
3. The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as input and creates a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
4. The function then returns the string `s` repeated `n` times.

The key insight here is that by repeating the string `s` `n` times, the program ensures that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the resulting string.

For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` would be `"ab"`. Repeating `s` twice would result in the string `"abab"`, which contains all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, and `"bb"`).

Therefore, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
