#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers, each integer is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.
    a = min(l)

    #State: Output State: li is a list of n^2 integers, each integer is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to a + (n - 1) * c + (n - 1) * d, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers, each integer is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, a is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.

    if (l == li) :

        #The program returns the string 'yes'.
    #State: *li is a sorted list of n^2 integers, each integer is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to a + (n - 1) * c + (n - 1) * d, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers, each integer is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9. l and li are not equal

    #The program returns the string 'no'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given list of integers can be rearranged into a specific pattern. It takes as input a list of n^2 integers, an integer n greater than or equal to 2, and integers c and d greater than or equal to 1. The function first finds the minimum value in the list, then generates a new list of n^2 integers based on this minimum value, n, c, and d. It sorts both lists and compares them. If the lists are equal, the function returns 'yes', indicating that the original list can be rearranged into the specified pattern. Otherwise, it returns 'no', indicating that the original list cannot be rearranged into the specified pattern.
