Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square of size n, based on the provided values of c and d.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, c, and d, and the array of integers (l).
3. It defines a function `func_1` that takes n, c, d, and l as arguments.
4. Within `func_1`, it finds the minimum value in the array (a) and initializes an empty list (li).
5. It then constructs the progressive square by iterating over the rows and columns of the square, calculating the value at each position using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, and appends these values to the list (li).
6. It sorts both the constructed list (li) and the input array (l) in ascending order.
7. Finally, it checks if the sorted input array (l) is equal to the sorted constructed list (li). If they are equal, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array can be rearranged into a progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore,

Correctness: **True**
