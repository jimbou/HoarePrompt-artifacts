Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly constructs a progressive square based on the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, and checks if the elements of the square match the given array `b`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first reads the input parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the array `b`.
2. It then constructs the progressive square by iterating over the rows and columns, calculating the value of each element using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`, where `a` is the minimum value in the array `b`.
3. The program sorts the constructed square and the array `b` separately.
4. Finally, it checks if the sorted square and array `b` are equal. If they are, it returns "yes", indicating that the array `b` can be rearranged to form a progressive square with the given parameters. Otherwise, it returns "no".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array `b` can be rearranged to form a progressive square with the given parameters.
* When the array `b` cannot be rearranged to form a progressive square with the given parameters.
* When the array `b` contains duplicate elements.
* When the array `b` contains elements that are not integers.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
