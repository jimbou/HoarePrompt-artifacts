Output State: **li is a sorted list of n^2 integers, each integer is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to a + (n - 1) * c + (n - 1) * d, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers, each integer is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.**

The code sorts the lists `li` and `l` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The lists `li` and `l` are sorted, but their elements still fall within the same ranges as specified in the initial state.
