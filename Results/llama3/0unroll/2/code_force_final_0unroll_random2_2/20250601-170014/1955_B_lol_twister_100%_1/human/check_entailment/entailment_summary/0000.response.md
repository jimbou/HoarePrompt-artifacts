Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square and checks if the given list of integers can be rearranged into this pattern. The program first finds the minimum value in the list, which represents the top-left element of the square. It then generates a new list of integers based on this minimum value, the size of the square (n), and the values of c and d. The program sorts both lists and compares them. If the lists are equal, it means that the original list can be rearranged into the specified pattern, and the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

The program also handles the case where the input list cannot be rearranged into the specified pattern, as shown in the example where the input list contains the number 11, which is not present in the generated list.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
