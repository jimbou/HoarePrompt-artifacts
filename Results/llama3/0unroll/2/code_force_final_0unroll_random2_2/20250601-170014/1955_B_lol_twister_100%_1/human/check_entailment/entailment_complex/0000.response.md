Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` from the user.
2. The program correctly finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`, which is used to generate the progressive square.
3. The program correctly generates the progressive square by iterating over the rows and columns of the square and calculating the values based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
4. The program correctly sorts both the generated progressive square `li` and the original list `l`.
5. The program correctly compares the sorted lists `li` and `l` to determine if the original list can be rearranged into the specified pattern.
6. The program correctly returns 'yes' if the lists are equal and 'no' otherwise.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the rules for constructing a progressive square. The use of sorting to compare the lists is also correct, as it allows the program to efficiently determine if the original list can be rearranged into the specified pattern.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
