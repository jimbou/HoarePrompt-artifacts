Functionality: **This function determines whether a given list of integers can be rearranged into a specific pattern. It takes as input a list of n^2 integers, an integer n greater than or equal to 2, and integers c and d greater than or equal to 1. The function first finds the minimum value in the list, then generates a new list of n^2 integers based on this minimum value, n, c, and d. It sorts both lists and compares them. If the lists are equal, the function returns 'yes', indicating that the original list can be rearranged into the specified pattern. Otherwise, it returns 'no', indicating that the original list cannot be rearranged into the specified pattern.**
