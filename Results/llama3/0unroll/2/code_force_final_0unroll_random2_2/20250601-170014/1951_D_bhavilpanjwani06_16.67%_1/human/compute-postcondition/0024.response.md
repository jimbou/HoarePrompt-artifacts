Postcondition: ***A `ValueError` is raised because the second part of the input line cannot be converted to an integer. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been read. `n` is not less than `k`. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1, and the value of `n` which is equal to `k` is printed. If `n` does not equal `k`, then if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the value of `n - k + 1` which is greater than 1 is printed, followed by the number 1. If `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`, 'NO' is printed.***
