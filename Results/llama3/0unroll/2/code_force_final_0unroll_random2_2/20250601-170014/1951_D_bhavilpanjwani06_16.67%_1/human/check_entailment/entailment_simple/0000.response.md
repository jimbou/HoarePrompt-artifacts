Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible for Bob to set up the store such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program considers all possible cases:

- If n < k, it is impossible for Alice to buy k jewels, so the program prints 'NO'.
- If n == k, Alice can buy k jewels at a price of n per jewel, so the program prints 'YES' and the price.
- If n > k, the program checks if k - 1 < n - k + 1. If this condition is true, it means that Alice can buy k - 1 jewels at a price of n - k + 1 per jewel, and then buy 1 jewel at a price of 1. So, the program prints 'YES' and the prices. If the condition is false, it is impossible for Alice to buy k jewels, so the program prints 'NO'.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
