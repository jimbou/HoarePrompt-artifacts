You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end.
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(n)
            #This is printed: k (where k is the value of k)
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')

                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: a positive integer greater than 1, 1
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: *A `ValueError` is raised because the second part of the input line cannot be converted to an integer. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been read. `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the value of `n - k + 1` which is greater than 1 is printed, followed by the number 1. If `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`, 'NO' is printed.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: A `ValueError` is raised because the second part of the input line cannot be converted to an integer. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been read. The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`, and 'NO' is being printed

Case_2: A `ValueError` is raised because the second part of the input line cannot be converted to an integer. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been read. `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`, and 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
