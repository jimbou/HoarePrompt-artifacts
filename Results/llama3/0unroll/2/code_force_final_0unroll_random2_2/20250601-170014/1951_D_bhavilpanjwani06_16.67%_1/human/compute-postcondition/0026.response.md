Functionality: **Determines whether Alice can buy a certain number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the number of jewels and the number of coins used.**

This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, respectively. It then checks the following conditions:

* If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'.
* If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 1, and the value of `n` (which is equal to `k`).
* If `n` is not less than `k` and not equal to `k`, it checks if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', followed by the number 2, and the value of `n - k + 1` (which is greater than 1), followed by the number 1. If false, it prints 'NO'.

In summary, the function determines whether Alice can buy the desired number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the number of jewels and the number of coins used, covering all potential cases.
