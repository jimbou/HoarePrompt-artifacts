Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether Alice can buy a certain number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the number of jewels and the number of coins used. The program handles all possible cases: when Alice has less coins than the number of jewels she needs to buy, when she has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels, and when she has more coins than the number of jewels. In the last case, it checks if the number of jewels she can buy with the remaining coins is less than the number of jewels she needs to buy, and prints the appropriate result.

Correctness: **True**
