The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and converts them to integers. The first part is assigned to `n` and the second part is assigned to `k`.

Since the initial state specifies that the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases, this line is read and split into two parts. However, this line only contains one integer `t`, so the second part is an empty string.

The `map(int, ...)` function tries to convert both parts to integers. The first part, which is the integer `t`, is successfully converted to an integer. However, the second part, which is an empty string, cannot be converted to an integer and raises a `ValueError`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **A `ValueError` is raised because the second part of the input line cannot be converted to an integer. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been read.**
