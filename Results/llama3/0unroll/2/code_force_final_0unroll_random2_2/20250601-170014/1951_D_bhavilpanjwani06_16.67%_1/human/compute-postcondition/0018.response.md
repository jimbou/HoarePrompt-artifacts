Based on the precondition, we know that `n` is greater than `k` plus 1 minus `k`, which can be simplified to `n` is greater than 1. We also know that `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`, which implies that `n` is greater than `k`.

The print statement is `print(n - k + 1, 1)`. Here's what will be printed:

* `n - k + 1`: Since `n` is greater than `k`, `n - k` will be a positive integer. Adding 1 to this result will give us another positive integer. Therefore, `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer greater than 1.
* `1`: This is a literal integer value that will be printed as is.

Output: **a positive integer greater than 1, 1**
