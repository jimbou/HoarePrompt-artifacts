Output: **A `ValueError` is raised because the second part of the input line cannot be converted to an integer. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been read. `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `n` is greater than `k` plus 1 minus `k`, 'YES' is being printed and the number 2 is being printed, and this is printed: the value of `n - k + 1` which is greater than 1 and the number 1**
