Output: **A `ValueError` is raised because the second part of the input line cannot be converted to an integer. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been read. `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. `k - 1` is not less than `n - k + 1`, and 'NO' is printed**
