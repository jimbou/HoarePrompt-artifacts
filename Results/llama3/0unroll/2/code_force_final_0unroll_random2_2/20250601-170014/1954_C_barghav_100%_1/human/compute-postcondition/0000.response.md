The first line assigns the first string of digits from stdin to `a`. The second line assigns the second string of digits from stdin to `b`. Since the strings on each pair of lines have the same length, `a` and `b` have the same length. The third line initializes `f` to 0. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **a is a list of digits, b is a list of digits, f is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of strings of digits, each pair having the same length**
