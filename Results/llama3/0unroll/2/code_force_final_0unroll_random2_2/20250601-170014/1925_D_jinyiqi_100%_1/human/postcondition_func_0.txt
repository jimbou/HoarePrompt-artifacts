This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers (n, m, k) followed by m lines of three integers (a, b, f). It calculates the sum of f values for each test case, then computes the modular inverse of a value derived from n, m, k, and the sum of f values. The function prints the result of the modular inverse calculation for each test case. The function consumes all input from standard input and produces output for each test case.
