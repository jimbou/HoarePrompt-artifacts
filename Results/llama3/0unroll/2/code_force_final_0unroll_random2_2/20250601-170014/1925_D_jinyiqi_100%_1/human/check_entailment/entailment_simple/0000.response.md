Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. It also reads the friendship values `f_i` for each pair of friends.

2.  The program calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` by iterating over the `m` pairs of friends.

3.  It calculates the total number of possible pairs of children `cn2` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4.  The program then calculates the numerator `p` and denominator `q` of the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, which represents the sum of the products of the number of excursions, the total number of possible pairs, and the sum of the initial friendship values, as well as the sum of the products of the number of pairs of friends, the number of excursions, and the number of excursions minus one. The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`, which represents twice the square of the total number of possible pairs.

5.  The program calculates the greatest common divisor `gcd` of `p` and `q` using the `math.gcd` function and divides both `p` and `q` by `gcd` to simplify the fraction.

6.  Finally, the program calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo `M` (where `M` is `10^9 + 7`) using the `pow` function with three arguments and multiplies it by `p` to obtain the final result. The result is then printed for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required calculations and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
