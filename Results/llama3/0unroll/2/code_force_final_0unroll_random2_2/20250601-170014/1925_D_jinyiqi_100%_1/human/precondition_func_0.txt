stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains 3 integers n, m and k, followed by m lines each containing three integers a_i, b_i, f_i. n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n and a_i != b_i. f_i is an integer such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
