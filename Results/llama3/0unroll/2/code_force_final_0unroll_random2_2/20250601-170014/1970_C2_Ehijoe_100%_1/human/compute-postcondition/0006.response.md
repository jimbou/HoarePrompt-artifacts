Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with n-1 nodes, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, start is an integer, n and t are integers, edges is an empty list, empty is True, leaves is a deque containing all the leaf nodes in the tree represented by nodes, moves is a list of moves from the start node.**

The code assigns the integer value of the input to `start`. The `moves` variable is assigned the result of the `func_1` function, which takes `nodes` and `start` as arguments. The `func_1` function is not defined in the given code snippet, so its exact behavior is unknown. However, based on the context, it is likely that `func_1` calculates a list of moves from the `start` node in the tree represented by `nodes`. The `nodes`, `n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, and `leaves` variables are not modified by the code.
