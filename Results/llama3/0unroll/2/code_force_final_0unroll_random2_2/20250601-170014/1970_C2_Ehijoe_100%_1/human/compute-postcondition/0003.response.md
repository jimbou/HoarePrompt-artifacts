Output State: **nodes is a dictionary with n-1 nodes, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its adjacent nodes, start is a node in the tree represented by an integer, n and t are integers, edges is an empty list, empty is True, leaves is an empty deque**

The code creates an empty deque called `leaves`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The `nodes` dictionary still contains n-1 nodes, the `start` node is still a node in the tree, `n` and `t` are still integers, `edges` is still an empty list, and `empty` is still True. The new variable `leaves` is an empty deque.
