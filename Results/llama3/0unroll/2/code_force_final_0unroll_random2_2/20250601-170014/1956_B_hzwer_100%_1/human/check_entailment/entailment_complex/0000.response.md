Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the value of n, and the list of integers for each test case.

2. It initializes a count array (cnt) of size n+1 to keep track of the occurrences of each integer in the list. This is a good approach because the integers in the list are from 1 to n.

3. It then iterates over the list of integers and increments the corresponding count in the cnt array.

4. After that, it calculates the number of pairs of identical integers by summing the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 for each integer. This is correct because if the count of an integer is 2, it means there is a pair, and if the count is 1, it means there is no pair.

5. Finally, it prints the total number of pairs for each test case.

The program has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
