Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a space-separated list of n integers. The integer (n) is a positive integer and less or equal than 2 * 10^5. The list of integers contains integers from 1 to n, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence at most 2 times. input is now a function that reads a line from stdin and returns it as a string.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the `input` variable is now a function that reads a line from the standard input and returns it as a string. This function is defined as `sys.stdin.readline`. The test cases in the standard input remain unchanged.
