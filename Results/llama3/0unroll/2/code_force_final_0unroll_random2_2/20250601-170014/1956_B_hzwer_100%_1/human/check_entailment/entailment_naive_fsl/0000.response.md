Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by the player. It uses a count array `cnt` to store the frequency of each number in the player's hand. Then, it iterates over the count array and adds the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 to the answer. This is because if a number appears more than once in the player's hand, the player can score points by playing the second occurrence of that number.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, if a number appears only once in the player's hand, the count will be 1, and the program will not add any points to the answer. If a number appears twice in the player's hand, the count will be 2, and the program will add 1 point to the answer.

The program also handles the case where the input is empty or contains only one element. In these cases, the answer will be 0, which is correct.

Overall, the program is correct and handles all possible cases according to the problem description.
