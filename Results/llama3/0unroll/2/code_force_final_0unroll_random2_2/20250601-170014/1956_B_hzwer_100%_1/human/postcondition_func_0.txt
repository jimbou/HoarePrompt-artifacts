This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a list of n integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and calculates the number of pairs of identical integers by summing the maximum of 0 and the count minus 1 for each integer. Finally, it prints the total number of pairs for each test case.
