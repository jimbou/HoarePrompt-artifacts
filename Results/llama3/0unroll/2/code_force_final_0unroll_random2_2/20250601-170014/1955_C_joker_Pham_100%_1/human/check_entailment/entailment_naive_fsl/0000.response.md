Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates the Kraken's attacks on the ships, keeping track of the number of ships sunk and the remaining durability of each ship. The program handles the cases where the Kraken attacks the first or last ship, and it correctly updates the durability of the ships after each attack.

The program also handles the edge cases where the number of attacks is 0, or where the number of ships is 1. In these cases, the program correctly returns the number of ships sunk, which is 0.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it appears to produce the correct output in all cases. I have also reviewed the code and did not find any obvious errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly.

Therefore, based on my analysis, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.
