Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program iterates over each test case, calculates the optimal value of k (the number of buns to sell at a modified price), and then calculates the maximum profit.

The program handles the edge cases correctly:

* If b is less than or equal to a, it means that the modified price is not beneficial, so the program sells all buns at the usual price a.
* If b is greater than a, the program calculates the optimal value of k as the minimum of n and b - a. This ensures that the number of buns sold at the modified price does not exceed the number of buns available or the difference between the modified price and the usual price.

The program then calculates the maximum profit by adding the revenue from selling k buns at the modified price and the revenue from selling the remaining (n - k) buns at the usual price a.

The formula used to calculate the revenue from selling k buns at the modified price, `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`, is correct. It takes into account the decreasing price of each bun as k increases.

The program passes all the provided test cases, and after analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
