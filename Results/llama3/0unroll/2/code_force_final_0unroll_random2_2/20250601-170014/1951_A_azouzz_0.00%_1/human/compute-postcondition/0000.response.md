Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a binary string of size n (1 <= n <= 50).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now only contains one input: a binary string of size n, where n is between 1 and 50.
