Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the number of lamps is 2 and the desired configuration is "11". According to the problem description, lamps 1 and 2 are not adjacent when n=2, so it should be possible to turn them on. However, the program prints "NO" in this case because it checks for the substring '11' in the input string. This is an incorrect assumption because '11' can appear in the input string even if the lamps are not adjacent.

For example, if the input is:

2
11

The program should print "YES" because it is possible to turn on both lamps, but it prints "NO" instead.
