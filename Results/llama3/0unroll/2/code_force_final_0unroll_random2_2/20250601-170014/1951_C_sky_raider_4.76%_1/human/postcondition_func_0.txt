This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers. For each test case, it sorts the integers, calculates a value c based on the sorted integers and the given parameters, and prints the calculated value. The function repeats this process for each test case provided in the input.
