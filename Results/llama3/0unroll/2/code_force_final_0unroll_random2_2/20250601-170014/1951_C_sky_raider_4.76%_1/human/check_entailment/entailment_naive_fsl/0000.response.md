Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The issue lies in the way it calculates the total cost. The program sorts the prices of the tickets and then iterates over the sorted list, buying as many tickets as possible on each day. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that the prices of the tickets increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices and get [2, 4, 6, 8]. Then it will buy 2 tickets on the first day (price 2), 1 ticket on the second day (price 4), and 0 tickets on the third and fourth days. The total cost will be 2*2 + 1*4 = 8. However, the correct answer is 10, which can be achieved by buying 0 tickets on the first day, 0 tickets on the second day, 1 ticket on the third day (price 4), and 2 tickets on the fourth day (price 3).

The program does not correctly handle the case where it is beneficial to buy tickets on later days when the prices are lower, even if it means buying fewer tickets on earlier days.
