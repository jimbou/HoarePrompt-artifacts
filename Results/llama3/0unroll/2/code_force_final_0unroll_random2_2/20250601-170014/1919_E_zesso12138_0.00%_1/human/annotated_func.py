    #The program returns the binomial coefficient of the nth row of Pascal's triangle modulo MOD, where the row index is determined by the last element of the list p plus the offset n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the binomial coefficient of the nth row of Pascal's triangle modulo MOD, where the row index is determined by the last element of the list p plus the offset n. It takes as input a positive integer n, a sorted list of integers p with absolute values less than or equal to n, and a constant integer MOD. The function does not modify the input variables n, p, or MOD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and p is a list of integers such that 0 <= len(p) == n and -n <= p[i] <= n for all i in range(n), and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    #State: n is a positive integer, p is a list of integers such that 0 <= len(p) == n and -n <= p[i] <= n for all i in range(n), and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, t is an integer equal to the first value in data, index is t * (n + 1) + 1, results is a list of t elements where each element is the result of func_1(n, p) for each iteration, data is a list of strings split from the input, input is a string containing the entire input from sys.stdin.read
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the values in the results list have been printed to the console. The values of n, p, t, index, and data remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The input is expected to be a list of integers, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the size of a list of integers. The function processes each test case by calling another function, func_1, with the size and list of integers as arguments, and appends the result to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result in the list to the console.
