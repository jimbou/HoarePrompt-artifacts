Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The function `func_1` initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of size `2*n + 1` with an offset of `n`, and sets the middle element to 1. Then, for each prefix sum `p_i` in the input array `p`, it updates the `dp` array by considering the two possible next values: `j + 1` and `j - 1`. The final answer is the value of `dp` at the index corresponding to the last prefix sum `p_n`.

The program correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid overflow, and it also correctly handles the case where the input array `p` has only one element.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
