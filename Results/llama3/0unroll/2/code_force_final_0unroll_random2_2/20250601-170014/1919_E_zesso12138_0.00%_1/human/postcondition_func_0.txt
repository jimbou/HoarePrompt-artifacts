This function calculates and returns the binomial coefficient of the nth row of Pascal's triangle modulo MOD, where the row index is determined by the last element of the list p plus the offset n. It takes as input a positive integer n, a sorted list of integers p with absolute values less than or equal to n, and a constant integer MOD. The function does not modify the input variables n, p, or MOD.
