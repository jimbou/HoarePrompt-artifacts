Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints the results to the console. It takes no parameters and returns no value. The input is expected to be a list of integers, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the size of a list of integers. The function processes each test case by calling another function, func_1, with the size and list of integers as arguments, and appends the result to a list of results. Finally, it prints each result in the list to the console.**
