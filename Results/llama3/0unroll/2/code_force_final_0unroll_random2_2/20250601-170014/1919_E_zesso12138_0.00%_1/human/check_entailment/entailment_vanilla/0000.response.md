Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of initial arrays `a` such that the prefix sum array `p` after sorting results in the given sorted prefix sum array.

Function `func_1` is the core of the solution. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum. The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1`, where `n` is the size of the hidden array `a`. The `offset` variable is used to shift the indices of the `dp` array to accommodate negative prefix sums.

The outer loop iterates over the prefix sums, and the inner loop iterates over the possible values of the `dp` array. For each non-zero value in the `dp` array, it calculates the next possible values by adding or subtracting 1 from the current index. The results are stored in a new `dp` array, which is then updated.

Finally, the function returns the value of the `dp` array at the index corresponding to the last prefix sum in the input array `p`.

Function `func_2` is a wrapper function that reads the input data, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

The program uses the modulo operator (`% MOD`) to ensure that the intermediate results do not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the data type.

Based on the provided problem description and the code, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, and it handles the modulo operation correctly.

Correctness: **True**
