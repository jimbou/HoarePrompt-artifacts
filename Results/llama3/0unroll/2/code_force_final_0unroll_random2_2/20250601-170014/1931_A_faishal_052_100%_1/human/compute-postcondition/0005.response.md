Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints output to standard output. It accepts an integer t (1 <= t <= 100) followed by t integers n (3 <= n <= 78) as input. The function then converts each integer n into a list of three integers, sorts the list, and appends it to a list of lists. Finally, it prints a string of lowercase letters to standard output, where each letter is the result of adding 96 to the corresponding integer in the list and converting it to a character using the chr function. The function does not return any value.**
