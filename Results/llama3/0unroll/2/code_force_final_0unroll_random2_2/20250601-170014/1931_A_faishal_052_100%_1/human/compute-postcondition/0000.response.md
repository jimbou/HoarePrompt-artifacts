Output State: **cases is an integer between 1 and 100, info is an empty list, stdin contains t integers n (3 <= n <= 78)**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `cases`. Since `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, this line does not affect any other variables. The second line initializes `info` as an empty list. No other variables are affected.
