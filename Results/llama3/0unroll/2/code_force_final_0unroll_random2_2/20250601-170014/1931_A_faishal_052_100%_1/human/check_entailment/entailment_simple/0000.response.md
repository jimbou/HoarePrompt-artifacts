Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the encoded words `n` from the input.

2. For each encoded word `n`, the program correctly calculates the three letters that could have been encoded. It does this by subtracting the maximum possible value (26) from `n` until `n` is less than 28. This ensures that the first two letters are as small as possible, which is necessary for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

3. The program then appends the remaining value of `n` to the list of letters. This remaining value represents the third letter.

4. The program sorts the list of letters in ascending order. This is necessary because the letters need to be in the correct order to form the lexicographically smallest word.

5. Finally, the program converts each letter from its numerical value to its corresponding lowercase letter using the `chr` function and prints the resulting word.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
