Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 48, the program outputs "auz", but the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is actually "aav".

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the encoded word is between 48 and 52. In this case, the program should output "aav", but it outputs "auz" instead.

Here is the correct output for the input 48:

* aav (1 + 1 + 46 = 48)

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly.
