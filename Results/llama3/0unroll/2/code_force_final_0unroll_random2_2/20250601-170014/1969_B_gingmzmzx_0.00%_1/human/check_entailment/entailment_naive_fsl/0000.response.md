Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, consider the input string "101". The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 1. The program is counting the number of operations required to sort the string, but it is not considering the optimal solution. In this case, the optimal solution is to choose the substring "10" and perform a cyclic shift, which will result in the sorted string "01". This requires only 1 operation, not 2.

The program is not correctly implementing the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order. It is simply counting the number of operations required to sort the string, but it is not considering the optimal solution. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
