Output State: **The output state will be the sum of the number of 1's in each binary string s, multiplied by the number of 0's in the same string, plus the number of 0's in each string.**

In other words, the output state will be the sum of the products of the number of 1's and 0's in each binary string, plus the total number of 0's in all strings.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. For each binary string s, the loop counts the number of 0's (zeroes) and initializes two counters, cnt[0] and cnt[1], to 0.
2. The loop then iterates over each character c in the string s. For each character:
	* If c is 0, it increments cnt[0] and adds 1 to the answer (ans) if cnt[1] is greater than 0.
	* If c is 1, it increments cnt[1] and adds the number of 0's in the string (zeroes) minus the current count of 0's (cnt[0]) to the answer (ans).
3. After iterating over all characters in the string, the loop prints the answer (ans).
4. The loop repeats steps 1-3 for each of the n binary strings.

The output state is the sum of the answers printed for each string. Since the answer for each string is the product of the number of 1's and 0's plus the number of 0's, the output state is the sum of these products plus the total number of 0's in all strings.
