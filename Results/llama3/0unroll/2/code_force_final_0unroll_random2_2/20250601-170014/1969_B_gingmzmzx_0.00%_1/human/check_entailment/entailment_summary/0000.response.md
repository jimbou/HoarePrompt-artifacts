Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts. 

The program first counts the total number of zeroes in the string. Then, it iterates over the string, maintaining a count of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far. For each character, it calculates the cost of making the string sorted up to that point. If the character is a zero, the cost is 1 if there are any ones to its left (i.e., cnt[1] > 0). If the character is a one, the cost is the number of zeroes to its right (i.e., zeroes - cnt[0]). The total cost is the sum of these costs.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge cases properly. For example, if the string is already sorted, the cost will be 0, which is correct.

Correctness: **True**
