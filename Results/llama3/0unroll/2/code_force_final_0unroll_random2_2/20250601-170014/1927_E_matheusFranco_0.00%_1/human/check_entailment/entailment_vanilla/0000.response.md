Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A permutation is k-level if the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the input n and k, constructs the permutation, and prints it. `func_2` reads the number of test cases t and calls `func_1` t times.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of `func_1`:

1. It initializes an array `permutation` of size n with all elements set to 0.
2. It sets `idx` to 0 and `idx_v` to 1, which will be used to fill the permutation array.
3. It sets `curr_v` to 1, which will be used to assign values to the permutation array.
4. It iterates over the range of k (from 0 to k-1). For each iteration, it calculates `multiples_of_k_plus_i` as `i`, which represents the starting index of the segment of length k.
5. It enters a while loop that continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of the permutation array. In each iteration, it assigns the current value `curr_v` to the permutation array at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, increments `curr_v` by 1, and increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by k.
6. After the while loop, it constructs a string `result` by joining the elements of the permutation array with spaces and prints it.

The key insight here is that the program is constructing the permutation by filling in the segments of length k in a specific order. By assigning values to the permutation array in this order, the program ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

For example, consider the case where n = 10 and k = 4. The program will construct the permutation as follows:

* `multiples_of_k_plus_i` = 0, `curr_v` = 1: permutation[0] = 1, permutation[4] = 2, permutation[8] = 3
* `multiples_of_k_plus_i` = 1, `curr_v` = 4: permutation[1] = 4, permutation[5] = 5, permutation[9] = 6
* `multiples_of_k_plus_i` = 2, `curr_v` = 7: permutation[2] = 7, permutation[6] = 8
* `multiples_of_k_plus_i` = 3, `curr_v` = 10: permutation[3] = 10

The resulting permutation is [1, 4, 7, 10, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 9], which is indeed a k-level permutation.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will be a k-level permutation for any given input n and k.

Correctness: **True**
