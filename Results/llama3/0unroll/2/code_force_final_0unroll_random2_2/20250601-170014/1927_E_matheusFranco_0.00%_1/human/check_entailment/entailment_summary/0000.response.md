Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is defined as a permutation where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function `func_1` generates a permutation of n integers, where each integer is 1 plus the smallest integer multiple of k that is greater than or equal to its index in the permutation list. This construction ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will differ by no more than 1, as required by the problem.

Function `func_2` repeats the call to `func_1` a specified number of times, which is the number of test cases.

Since `func_1` correctly generates a k-level permutation and `func_2` repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, the overall program meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
