Functionality: **Repeats a function call a specified number of times.**

This function accepts an integer input (greater than 0) from the user and uses it to control the number of times a separate function, `func_1()`, is called. After the specified number of iterations, the function concludes, leaving the input variable `t` in a state of 0.
