Output State: `t` equals 0.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` has been decremented to 0. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and in each iteration, `func_1()` is called and `t` is decremented by 1. Once `t` reaches 0, the loop condition is no longer met, and the loop terminates. The state of other variables not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
