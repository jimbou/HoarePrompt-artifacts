Output State: `t` equals 0.



The output state is that the variable `t` has been decremented to 0 after the loop has executed all its iterations. The initial value of `t` was greater than 0, and with each iteration of the loop, `t` was decremented by 1 until it reached 0, at which point the loop terminated.
