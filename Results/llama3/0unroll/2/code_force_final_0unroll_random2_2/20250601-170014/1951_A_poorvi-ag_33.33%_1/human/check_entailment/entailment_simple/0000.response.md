Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether a given binary string can be reached by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first checks if the number of '1's in the binary string is even. If it's not, it immediately appends 'no' to the results list, because it's impossible to reach a configuration with an odd number of '1's by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

2. If the number of '1's is even, it then checks if the binary string contains two adjacent '1's. If it does, it appends 'no' to the results list, because it's impossible to reach a configuration with two adjacent '1's by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

3. If the binary string does not contain two adjacent '1's, it appends 'yes' to the results list, because it's possible to reach the configuration by turning on non-adjacent lamps.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
