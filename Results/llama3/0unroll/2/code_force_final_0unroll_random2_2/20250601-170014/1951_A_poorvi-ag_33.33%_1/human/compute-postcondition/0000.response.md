Output State: **t is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`. Since the integer is a positive integer less than or equal to 50, `t` becomes that value. The second line initializes an empty list `results`. No other variables are affected. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case because one test case was used to get the value of `t`.
