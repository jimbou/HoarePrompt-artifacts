Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the number of lamps is 1 and the desired configuration is '1'. In this case, the program will print 'no', but the correct answer should be 'no' because it is impossible to turn on a single lamp by choosing two non-adjacent lamps. The program does not handle this edge case correctly.
