Output State: **The loop will print the length and binary representation of each input number x after applying a series of operations to the binary representation. The operations involve flipping bits, inserting a new bit, and shifting bits. The output will be a sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s) with a possible additional bit appended at the end. The length of the output will be between 30 and 31.**
