The function reads a series of positive integers from standard input, applies a series of bit manipulation operations to each integer's binary representation, and prints the resulting binary representation along with its length. The operations involve flipping bits, inserting a new bit, and shifting bits, resulting in a binary sequence of length 30 or 31.
