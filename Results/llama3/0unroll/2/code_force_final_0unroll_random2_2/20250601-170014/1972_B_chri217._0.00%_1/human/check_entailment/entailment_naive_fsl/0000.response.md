Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The function `func_1(s)` only checks if the number of 'U's in the string is odd or even, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine the winner.

A counterexample is the case where the input string is "UUDD". In this case, the number of 'U's is even, but Alice can still win the game by choosing the first 'U' and flipping the adjacent 'D's, leaving Bob with no 'U's to choose from.

The correct solution would require a more complex analysis of the game state, taking into account the positions of the 'U's and 'D's, and the possible moves that can be made by each player.
