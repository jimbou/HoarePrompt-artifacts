Output State: `t` is a positive integer read from stdin, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`, stdin is empty, and the loop has executed `t` times, printing the result of the binary search for each iteration.
