    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer read from stdin, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`, stdin is empty, `L` is an integer, `R` is an integer, `numCuts` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `leftover` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists of integers, `z` is an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a positive integer `t` from standard input, then for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` such that `k` < `n`. It constructs an undirected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, where each edge is represented by two positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`. The function then performs a binary search to find the minimum integer `L` such that the number of cuts required to make the graph connected is greater than `k` or the number of cuts is equal to `k` and the leftover value is greater than or equal to `L`. Finally, it prints the value of `L` for each test case.
