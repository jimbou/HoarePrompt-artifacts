Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from stdin, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k` < `n`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to a positive integer read from stdin. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty since it has been read.
