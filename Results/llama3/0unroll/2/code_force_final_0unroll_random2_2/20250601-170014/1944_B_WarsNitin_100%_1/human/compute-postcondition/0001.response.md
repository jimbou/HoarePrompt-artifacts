Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of pairs of lists, where each pair represents the modified lists 'ans1' and 'ans2' for each test case. The lists 'ans1' and 'ans2' contain the elements from the original lists 'b' and 'c' respectively, with the elements from 'b' and 'c' that appear only once in their respective lists appended to 'ans1' and 'ans2' in alternating order, until the value of 'k' becomes 0. The remaining elements from 'b' and 'c' that appear more than once in their respective lists are appended to 'ans1' and 'ans2' in pairs, until the value of 'k' becomes 0. The lists 'ans1' and 'ans2' are printed for each test case.**
