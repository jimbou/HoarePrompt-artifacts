This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, separating them into two lists, and modifies these lists by appending elements that appear only once in alternating order, and elements that appear more than once in pairs, until a certain condition (k) is met. The modified lists are then printed for each test case.
