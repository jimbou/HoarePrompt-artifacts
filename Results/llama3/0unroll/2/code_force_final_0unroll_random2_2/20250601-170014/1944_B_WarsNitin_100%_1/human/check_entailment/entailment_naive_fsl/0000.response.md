Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

4
2 1
1 2 2 1
6 1
6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

The program will output:

2 1
2 1
6 4
1 3
1 2
1 2
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 1
6 4
1 3
1 2
1 2
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the input array has duplicate elements. The program tries to find pairs of equal elements in the first half of the array and the second half of the array, but it does not consider the case when the same element appears multiple times in the same half of the array.

For example, in the input:

4
2 1
1 2 2 1

The program will output:

2 1
2 1

However, the correct output should be:

1 2
1 2

The program does not correctly handle the case when the same element appears multiple times in the same half of the array.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
