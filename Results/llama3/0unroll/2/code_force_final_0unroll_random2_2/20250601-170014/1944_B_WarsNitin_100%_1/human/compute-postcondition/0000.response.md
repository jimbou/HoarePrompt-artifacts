The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n`. 

The first integer from the first line of the first test case is assigned to `t`. The value of `t` is equal to the first integer from the first line of the first test case. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is equal to the first integer from the first line of the first test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases.**
