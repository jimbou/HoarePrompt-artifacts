You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a list of all the digits in the password string, letters is a list of all the letters in the password string.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop finishes all its iterations without returning False, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. The password is still a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, digits is a sorted list of all the digits in the password string, and letters is a sorted list of all the letters in the password string.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns a boolean value of True, indicating a successful operation or condition, without modifying the existing variables or their values, which include the password, digits, letters, and sortedPassword.
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the sortedPassword is not equal to the password.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a boolean value of True, indicating a successful operation or condition, without modifying the existing variables or their values, which include the password, digits, letters, and sortedPassword.

Case_2: The program returns False, indicating that the sortedPassword is not equal to the password.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
