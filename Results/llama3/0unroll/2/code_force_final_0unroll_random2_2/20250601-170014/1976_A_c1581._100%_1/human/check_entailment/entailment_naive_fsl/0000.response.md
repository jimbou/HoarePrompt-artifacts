Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. The current implementation only checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which is not sufficient. 

For example, the input "a1b2" would be incorrectly classified as a strong password by the program, because it does not check if any digit comes after a letter. The correct output should be "NO" because the digit '1' comes after the letter 'a' and the digit '2' comes after the letter 'b'.
