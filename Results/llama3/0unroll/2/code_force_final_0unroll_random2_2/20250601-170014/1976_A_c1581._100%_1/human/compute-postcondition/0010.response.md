Functionality: **This function checks if a given password string is already sorted in ascending order. It accepts a password string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the password is sorted or not. The function does not modify the original password string or any other input variables. It performs the following actions: extracts digits and letters from the password, sorts them separately, and then checks if the sorted digits and letters are in ascending order within their respective groups and also in relation to each other. If the sorted digits and letters are in ascending order and the sorted password matches the original password, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.**
