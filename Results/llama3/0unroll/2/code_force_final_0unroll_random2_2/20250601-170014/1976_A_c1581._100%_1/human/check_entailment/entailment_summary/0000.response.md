Reasoning:

The given program is designed to check if a password meets certain conditions: it should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, there should be no digit that comes after a letter, all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program defines a function `func_1(password)` that takes a password as input and checks these conditions. It first separates the digits and letters from the password, sorts them separately, and then checks if the sorted digits and letters are in ascending order within their respective groups and also in relation to each other.

However, there is a logical error in the function. The condition `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` is unnecessary because the digits are already sorted in ascending order. This condition will always be false.

Moreover, the condition `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` is also incorrect. It checks if the last digit is greater than any letter, which is not a correct condition. The correct condition should be to check if any digit comes after a letter in the original password.

To fix these errors, the function should be modified to check if any digit comes after a letter in the original password, and if the sorted digits and letters are in ascending order within their respective groups.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    sortedPassword = ''.join(letters + digits)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Correctness: **False**
