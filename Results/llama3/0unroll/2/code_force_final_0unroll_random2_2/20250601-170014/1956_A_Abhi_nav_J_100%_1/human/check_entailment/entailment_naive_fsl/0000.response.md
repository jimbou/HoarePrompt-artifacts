Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and the number of players `b`, but it does not take into account the rest of the sequence `a` and the fact that players are kicked out simultaneously.

A counterexample is when `a = [3, 5]` and `b = 5`. According to the problem statement, the correct output should be `2`, but the program outputs `2` which is incorrect because it only considers the first element of `a` which is `3` and does not take into account the second element `5`. 

The correct implementation should simulate the game by repeatedly removing players according to the sequence `a` until no more players can be removed, and then return the number of remaining players.
