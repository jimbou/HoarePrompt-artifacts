Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input grid contains a row of zeros followed by a row of ones, and the first column contains a zero. In this case, the program will incorrectly output the lexicographically smallest string as the string consisting of the first row followed by the last character of the second row, instead of the correct string which is the first row followed by the second row.

For example, if the input is:

3
2
00
11

The program will output:

000
2

Instead of the correct output:

00
1

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the first column contains a zero and the second column contains a one. The program should output the first row followed by the second row, but instead it outputs the first row followed by the last character of the second row.
