Functionality: **This function reads two binary strings of the same length from standard input and outputs a new binary string formed by concatenating the prefix of the first string and the suffix of the second string, where the prefix and suffix are determined by the first mismatch between the two input strings. If no mismatch is found, the function outputs the concatenation of the first string and the last character of the second string. Additionally, the function prints the length of the longest common suffix between the second input string and the output string.**
