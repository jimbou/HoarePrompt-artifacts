Output: **The list s contains the binary string formed by concatenating the first i + 1 characters of the first binary string in a and the last n - i - 1 characters of the second binary string in a, where i is the index at which the first mismatch between the two binary strings was found, x is equal to i, and y is equal to the index of the last mismatch between the two binary strings. If no mismatch was found, s contains the concatenation of the first binary string in a and the last character of the second binary string in a, and x is equal to n - 1. Additionally, t is assigned the value x - i + 1, and the binary string s is printed without any separator**
