The code prints the value of `t`, which is calculated as `x - i + 1`. 

Here, `x` is equal to `i` if a mismatch is found between the two binary strings in `a`, and `x` is equal to `n - 1` if no mismatch is found. 

`i` is the index at which the first mismatch between the two binary strings was found. If no mismatch was found, `i` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, but based on the context, it can be inferred that `i` would be equal to `n - 1` in this case, because `x` is equal to `n - 1` when there is no mismatch.

Therefore, the value of `t` can be described as follows:

- If a mismatch is found, `t` is equal to `i - i + 1`, which simplifies to `1`.
- If no mismatch is found, `t` is equal to `(n - 1) - (n - 1) + 1`, which also simplifies to `1`.

In both cases, the value of `t` is `1`.

Output: **1**
