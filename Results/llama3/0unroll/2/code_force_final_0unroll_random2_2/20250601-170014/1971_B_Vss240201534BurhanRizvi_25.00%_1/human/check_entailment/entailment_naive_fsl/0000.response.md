Correctness: **False**.

The program does not guarantee that the rearranged string `s2` will be different from the original string `s`. In the case where the input string `s` has only one unique character (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program will always output "No" because the rearranged string `s2` will be the same as the original string `s`. However, the program should output "NO" (without quotes) in this case, not "No".

Additionally, the program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the input string, which may not always produce a different string. For example, if the input string is "ab", the program may output "ab" again, which is not a different string.

A correct solution would need to ensure that the rearranged string is always different from the original string, and handle the case where the input string has only one unique character correctly.
