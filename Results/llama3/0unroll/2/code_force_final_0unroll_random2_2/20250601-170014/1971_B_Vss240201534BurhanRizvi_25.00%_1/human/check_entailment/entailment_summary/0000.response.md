Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It reads a series of strings from standard input, shuffles each string randomly, and prints 'Yes' followed by the shuffled string if the shuffled string is different from the original, or 'No' if they are the same. This behavior matches the problem description, which asks to rearrange the characters of a string to form a new string that is not equal to the original, or report that it's impossible.

The program uses the `random.sample` function to shuffle the characters of each string, which is a valid approach. The `if s != s2` condition checks if the shuffled string is different from the original, and the program prints 'Yes' and the shuffled string if this condition is true, or 'No' if it's false.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes a number of strings specified by an initial integer input, and it empties the standard input after processing all strings, which matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
