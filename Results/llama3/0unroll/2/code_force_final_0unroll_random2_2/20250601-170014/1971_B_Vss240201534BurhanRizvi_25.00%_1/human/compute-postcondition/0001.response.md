Functionality: **This function reads a series of strings from standard input, shuffles each string randomly, and prints 'Yes' followed by the shuffled string if the shuffled string is different from the original, or 'No' if they are the same. The function processes a number of strings specified by an initial integer input, and it empties the standard input after processing all strings.**
