Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move involves choosing to exchange wallets with their opponent or to keep their current wallets, and then removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step.

The given program determines the winner of the game by checking if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. If the difference is even, the program prints 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win the game. If the difference is odd, the program prints 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win the game.

This approach is correct because the game can be analyzed as follows:

* If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Alice and Bob can alternate turns, with each player removing 1 coin from their current wallet. Since the difference is even, both players will eventually run out of coins at the same time, and Bob will win the game because he makes the last move.
* If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is odd, then Alice and Bob cannot alternate turns in the same way. Instead, Alice can make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, forcing Bob to make a move that leaves Alice with an odd number of coins. This process can continue indefinitely, with Alice always having an odd number of coins and Bob always having an even number of coins. Therefore, Alice will win the game.

Overall, the given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
