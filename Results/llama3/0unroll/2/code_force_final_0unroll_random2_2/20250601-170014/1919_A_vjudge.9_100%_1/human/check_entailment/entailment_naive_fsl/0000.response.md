Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The key insight is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move, which is determined by the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

The program uses the fact that if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob will win, and if it is odd, then Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their wallet, and the player who can make the last move is the one who has the wallet with the smaller number of coins.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets using the expression `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`. If this expression is true, then Bob wins, and if it is false, then Alice wins.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
