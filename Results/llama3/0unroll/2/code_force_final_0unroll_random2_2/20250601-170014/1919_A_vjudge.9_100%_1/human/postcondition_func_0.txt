The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then reads t pairs of integers (a, b). For each pair, it determines whether the absolute difference between a and b is even or odd and prints 'Bob' or 'Alice', respectively, to standard output. The function does not modify the input values or return any values, only producing output based on the input pairs.
