Reasoning:
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in the two wallets.

If the absolute difference is even, Bob will win, and if it's odd, Alice will win. This is because the players take turns removing one coin from their current wallet, and the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. By analyzing the possible moves and their outcomes, it can be concluded that the parity of the absolute difference determines the winner.

The program correctly implements this logic by calculating the absolute difference between `a` and `b` using the `abs` function and then checking if the result is even or odd using the modulo operator (`%`). Based on the result, it prints either 'Bob' or 'Alice' to standard output.

Correctness: **True**
