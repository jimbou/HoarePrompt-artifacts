Reasoning:

The problem description states that the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. A valid move consists of choosing to exchange wallets with their opponent or keeping their current wallet, and then removing 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which means their wallet is empty.

The given program uses the fact that the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets determines the winner of the game. If the absolute difference is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

This is correct because the game can be viewed as a series of moves where each player tries to make the other player's wallet empty. If the absolute difference between the number of coins in the wallets is even, it means that both players have an equal number of "moves" to make before their wallet becomes empty. In this case, Bob wins because he makes the last move.

On the other hand, if the absolute difference is odd, it means that one player has one more "move" than the other. In this case, Alice wins because she makes the last move.

Therefore, the given program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
