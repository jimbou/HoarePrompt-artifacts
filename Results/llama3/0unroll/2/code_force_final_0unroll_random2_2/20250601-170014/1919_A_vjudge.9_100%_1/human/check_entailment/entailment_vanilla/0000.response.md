Reasoning:

The problem is asking us to determine who will win a game between Alice and Bob, where they take turns exchanging wallets and removing coins. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses.

The given program uses the fact that the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets determines who will win. If the difference is even, Bob will win, and if the difference is odd, Alice will win.

Here's why this works:

* If the difference is even, Alice and Bob will always have the same parity (i.e., both even or both odd) after each move. Since Bob starts with an even number of coins, he will always have an even number of coins, and Alice will always have an odd number of coins. Therefore, Bob will always be able to make a move, and Alice will eventually run out of coins.
* If the difference is odd, Alice and Bob will always have different parities after each move. Since Alice starts with an odd number of coins, she will always have an odd number of coins, and Bob will always have an even number of coins. Therefore, Alice will always be able to make a move, and Bob will eventually run out of coins.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd, and printing "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
