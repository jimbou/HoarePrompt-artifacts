#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 1001, stdin contains no input, and the stdout contains 1000 lines, each containing three random digits from 1 to 9, followed by either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state is that the variable `i` has been incremented to 1001, the standard input (stdin) is empty, and the standard output (stdout) contains 1000 lines of output. Each line consists of three random digits between 1 and 9, followed by a string that indicates whether the digits form a "peak" (the middle digit is greater than both the first and last digits), a "stair" (the middle digit is greater than the first digit but less than the last digit), or "none" (the middle digit is not greater than both the first and last digits, or the digits are in decreasing order).

#Overall this is what the function does:Generates 1000 lines of output, each containing three random digits between 1 and 9, followed by a string indicating whether the digits form a "peak", "stair", or "none", based on the relative values of the digits. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It solely modifies the standard output (stdout) with the generated lines.
