Output State: `i` is 1001, stdin contains no input, and the stdout contains 1000 lines, each containing three random digits from 1 to 9, followed by either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `i` has been incremented to 1001, the standard input (stdin) is empty, and the standard output (stdout) contains 1000 lines of output. Each line consists of three random digits between 1 and 9, followed by a string that indicates whether the digits form a "peak" (the middle digit is greater than both the first and last digits), a "stair" (the middle digit is greater than the first digit but less than the last digit), or "none" (the middle digit is not greater than both the first and last digits, or the digits are in decreasing order).
