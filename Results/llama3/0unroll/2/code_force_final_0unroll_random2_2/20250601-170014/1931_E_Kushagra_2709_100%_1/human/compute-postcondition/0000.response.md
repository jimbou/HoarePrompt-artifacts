The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line converts the value of `num` to a string and assigns it back to `num`. The second line initializes a new variable `tot` and assigns it the value 0. The third line is an empty statement and does not affect any variables.

Output State: **num is a string representation of its original non-negative integer value, tot is 0**
