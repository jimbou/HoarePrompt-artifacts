This function determines the winner of a game based on the total count of digits in a list of numbers and a given threshold. It takes three inputs: a positive integer n, a non-negative integer m, and a list of n positive integers. The function calculates the total count of digits in the list of numbers, then reduces this total by the sum of every other value in a sorted list of digit counts, starting from the highest count. The function returns 'Sasha' if the reduced total is greater than or equal to the threshold m plus 1, and 'Anna' otherwise.
