Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the game logic and determines the winner based on the optimal play. The `func_1` function calculates the total number of digits in the list and then subtracts the number of trailing zeros in the largest numbers (which can be removed by Anna's moves) to determine the final length of the number. If this length is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

The `zerocnts` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When Anna can remove all trailing zeros, making the final number shorter than `m + 1`.
* When Anna cannot remove all trailing zeros, making the final number longer than or equal to `m + 1`.
* When the list contains only one number, in which case Sasha wins if the number is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
* When the list contains multiple numbers, in which case the program correctly calculates the total number of digits and subtracts the number of trailing zeros.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
