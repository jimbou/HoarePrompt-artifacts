Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program seems to be solving a different problem, which is to find the maximum number of '@' characters in a path, where '*' characters represent obstacles.

The program does not take into account the periodicities of the signs, and it does not calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. It seems to be a solution to a different problem.

To solve the original problem, a different approach is needed, such as using a loop to iterate over the signs and calculate the year in which each sign will occur, taking into account the periodicities of the signs.
