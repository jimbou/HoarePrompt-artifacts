Output State: **data is a list of strings where data[0] is a positive integer, and for each i > 0, data[i] is either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers separated by spaces, t is a positive integer equal to data[0], index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin is empty**

Explanation:
The code reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. The first element of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to the variable `t`. The variable `index` is initialized to 1, and an empty list `results` is created. After executing the code, stdin is empty because the entire input has been read. The state of `data` remains the same as in the initial state, with `data[0]` being a positive integer and each subsequent element being either a positive integer or a string that can be converted to a list of positive integers separated by spaces. The value of `t` is equal to the value of `data[0]`, which is a positive integer. The value of `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.
