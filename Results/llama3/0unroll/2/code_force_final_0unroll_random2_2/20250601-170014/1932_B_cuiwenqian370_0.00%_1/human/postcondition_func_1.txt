Reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of strings, and then iterates over the list to extract positive integers and paths. For each path, it calls the `func_1` function and appends the result to a `results` list. Finally, it prints each result from the `results` list on a new line, effectively outputting the processed data to standard output.
