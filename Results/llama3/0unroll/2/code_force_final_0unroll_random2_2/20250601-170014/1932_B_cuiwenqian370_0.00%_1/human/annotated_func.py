    #The program returns the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached by traversing the path from the start to any character in the list, excluding '*' characters and considering the maximum of the previous two characters.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached by traversing a given path, excluding '*' characters and considering the maximum of the previous two characters. It accepts a list of characters as input, where each character is either '@' or '*', and returns an integer value representing the maximum reachable '@' characters. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0.

    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed t times, and the results list remains unchanged, containing t elements, each of which is the result of calling func_1 with the corresponding path from the data list. The index variable has been incremented by 2*t, and the stdin is now filled with the t elements from the results list, each printed on a new line.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of strings, and then iterates over the list to extract positive integers and paths. For each path, it calls the `func_1` function and appends the result to a `results` list. Finally, it prints each result from the `results` list on a new line, effectively outputting the processed data to standard output.
