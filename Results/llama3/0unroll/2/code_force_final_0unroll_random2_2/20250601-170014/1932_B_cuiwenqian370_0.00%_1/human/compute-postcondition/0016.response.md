Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path`, `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is 2 if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is 1, and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is -infinity, `dp[1]` is -infinity if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is -infinity, and the rest are zeros. If the first character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is 1 if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is 0, and the rest are zeros. The second character of `path` is not '*'.**

In natural language, the output state is that the `path` and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The `dp` list is updated such that its second element (`dp[1]`) is the sum of the first element (`dp[0]`) and 1 if the second character of `path` is '@', otherwise it is the same as the first element. The rest of the elements in `dp` remain the same as in the initial state.
