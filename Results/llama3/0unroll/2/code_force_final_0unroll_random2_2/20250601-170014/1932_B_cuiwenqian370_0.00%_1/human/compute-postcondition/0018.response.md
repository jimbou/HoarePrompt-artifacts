Postcondition: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path`, `n` is not equal to 0. If `n` is 1, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -infinity if the first character of `path` is '*', and 0 if the first character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*'. If `n` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -infinity if the first character of `path` is '*', and 0 if the first character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*'. `dp[1]` is -infinity if the second character of `path` is '*', 2 if the second character of `path` is '@' and the first character of `path` is '@', 1 if the second character of `path` is '@' and the first character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', and 1 if the second character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*' and the first character of `path` is '@'. The rest of the values in `dp` are 0.**
