Reasoning: 

The provided code does not match the problem description. The problem description is about finding the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided code appears to be solving a different problem, which involves finding the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached by traversing a path from the start to any character in the list, excluding '*' characters.

The code provided does not take into account the periodicities of the signs, nor does it calculate the year when the n-th sign will occur. Therefore, the code is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
