Output State: **The program returns the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached by traversing the path from the start to any character in the list, excluding '*' characters and considering the maximum of the previous two characters.**

In this output state, the program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. The list `dp` contains the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached by traversing the path from the start to each character in the list, considering that '*' characters cannot be traversed. If a character is '*', its corresponding value in `dp` is -infinity. If a character is '@', its corresponding value in `dp` is the maximum of the previous two characters plus 1. If a character is neither '@' nor '*', its corresponding value in `dp` is the maximum of the previous two characters.
