Postcondition: ***`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path`, `n` is not equal to 0, the first character of `path` is not '@'. If the first character of `path` is '*', `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is -infinity and the rest are zeros. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of `n` zeros.***
