Output State: `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[i]` is the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached by traversing the path from the start to the `i-th` character, considering that '*' characters cannot be traversed. If the `i-th` character is '*', `dp[i]` is -infinity. If the `i-th` character is '@', `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1. If the `i-th` character is neither '@' nor '*', `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`.
