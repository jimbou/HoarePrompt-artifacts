Postcondition: ***`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path`, `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -infinity and the rest are 0. If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is 2 and the rest are 0. If the second character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[1]` is 1 and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is -infinity. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -infinity and the rest are zeros. If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is -infinity and the rest are zeros. If the second character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[1]` is -infinity and the rest are zeros. If the first character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 0. If the second character of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is -infinity and the rest are zeros. If the second character of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is 1 and the rest are zeros. If the second character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros.***
