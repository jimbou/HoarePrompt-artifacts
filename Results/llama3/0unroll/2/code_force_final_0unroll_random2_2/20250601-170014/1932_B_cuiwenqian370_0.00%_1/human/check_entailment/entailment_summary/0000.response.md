Reasoning: 
The provided functions do not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided functions seem to be related to a different problem, involving traversing a path and counting '@' characters.

Function 1 appears to calculate the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached by traversing a given path, excluding '*' characters. Function 2 reads input from standard input, processes it into a list of strings, and then iterates over the list to extract positive integers and paths. For each path, it calls Function 1 and appends the result to a results list.

Since the provided functions do not match the problem description, they do not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
