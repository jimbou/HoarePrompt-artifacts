Reasoning:

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided program appears to be solving a different problem, involving a path with '@' and '*' characters.

The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a path as input and returns the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached in the path, while avoiding '*' characters. `func_2` reads input from the standard input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

However, the problem description does not mention anything about a path with '@' and '*' characters. Instead, it requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.

Therefore, the provided program does not solve the problem described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
