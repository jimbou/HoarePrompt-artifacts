Reasoning: 
The provided code does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the provided code seems to be solving a different problem, which involves calculating the maximum number of '@' characters that can be reached by traversing a given path, excluding '*' characters.

The code provided does not take into account the periodicities of the signs, nor does it calculate the year in which the n-th sign will occur. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
