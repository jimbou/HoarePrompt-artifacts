Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path`, `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. The first character of `path` is either '@' or '*', and the second character of `path` is '*'. If the first character of `path` is '@', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[1]` is -infinity and the rest are 0. If the first character of `path` is '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is -infinity, `dp[1]` is -infinity and the rest are zeros. If the first character of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is 0, `dp[1]` is -infinity and the rest are zeros.**

In this output state, the value of `dp[1]` has been updated to -infinity, regardless of the initial value of the first character of `path`. The other variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
