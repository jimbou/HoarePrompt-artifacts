Output State: **`path` is a list of characters where each character is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path`, `n` is not equal to 0, `dp` is a list of `n` values where the first value is -infinity and the rest are zeros, the first character of `path` is '*', and the current value of the first character of `path` is '*'**

In this output state, the only change from the initial state is that the first value of the `dp` list has been updated to -infinity, while the rest of the values remain zeros. The other variables, including `path`, `n`, and the first character of `path`, remain unchanged.
