The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a permutation of integers. For each test case, it determines the indices of the maximum and minimum elements in the permutation and prints the result in the format "! a b", where "a" is the index of the maximum element and "b" is the index of the minimum element. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input.
