Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of answers for each test case, where each answer is in the format "! a b" (without quotes), with "a" being the index of the maximum element in the permutation and "b" being the index of the minimum element in the permutation. The number of answers is equal to the number of test cases.**
