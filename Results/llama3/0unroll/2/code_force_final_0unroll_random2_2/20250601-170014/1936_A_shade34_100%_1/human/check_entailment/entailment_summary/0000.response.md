Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding any two indices i and j such that p_i âŠ• p_j is maximized in the given permutation p. The program uses a series of queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation and determines the indices of the maximum and minimum elements. It then prints the result in the required format.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles the different possible cases that can arise during the execution of the queries. It also ensures that the number of queries does not exceed the allowed limit of 3n.

Correctness: **True**
