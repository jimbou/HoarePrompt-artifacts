#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and s is not equal to 'mapie'
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and 'map' is not a substring of s, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the initial string s.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'pie' removed, and ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the initial string s.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the initial string s.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of lowercase Latin letters as input and returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the string, unless the input string is exactly 'mapie', in which case it returns 1. The function modifies the input string by removing all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' from it.
