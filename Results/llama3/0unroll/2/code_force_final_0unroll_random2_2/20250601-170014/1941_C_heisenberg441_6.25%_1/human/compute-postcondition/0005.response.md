Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters with all occurrences of 'pie' removed, and ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the initial string s.**

In this output state, the string s has been modified to remove all occurrences of the substring 'pie'. The variable ans now holds the count of how many times 'pie' appeared in the original string s before the loop started.
