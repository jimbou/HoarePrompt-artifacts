Output State: **s is a string of lowercase Latin letters, and 'map' is not a substring of s, ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the initial string s.**

In natural language, the output state means that after the loop finishes executing, the string `s` will no longer contain the substring 'map', and the variable `ans` will hold the count of how many times 'map' appeared in the original string `s`.
