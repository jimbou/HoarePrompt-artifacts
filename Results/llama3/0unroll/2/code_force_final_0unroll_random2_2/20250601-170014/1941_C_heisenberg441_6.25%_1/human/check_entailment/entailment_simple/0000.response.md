Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly identifies the substrings "map" and "pie" as the ones that make a string ugly.
2. It uses a while loop to remove all occurrences of "map" from the string, and then another while loop to remove all occurrences of "pie" from the string. This is correct because it ensures that all occurrences of these substrings are removed, regardless of their position in the string.
3. The program correctly counts the number of occurrences of "map" and "pie" that are removed, and returns this count as the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.
4. The program handles the special case where the input string is "mapie" correctly, returning 1 as the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
