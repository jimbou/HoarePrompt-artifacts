Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the string contains both "map" and "pie" and they overlap. For example, the string "mapie" should return 1, but the program returns 2. The program first removes "map" and then removes "pie", but it should remove only one of them to make the string beautiful.

Also, the program does not handle the case when the string contains multiple occurrences of "map" or "pie" that overlap with each other. For example, the string "mapmap" should return 1, but the program returns 2.

The program should be modified to handle these cases correctly. One possible solution is to use a single loop to iterate over the string and remove "map" or "pie" whenever they are found, without removing overlapping occurrences.
