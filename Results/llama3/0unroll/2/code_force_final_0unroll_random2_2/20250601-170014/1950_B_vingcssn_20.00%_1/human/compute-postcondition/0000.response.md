The code `casos = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 20) followed by t lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 20). Since the first input is an integer, it is assigned to `casos`, and the remaining inputs are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`casos` is an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), stdin contains `casos` lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 20)**
