Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for all values of n. The program only handles the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and for any other value of n, it prints the message 'No esta en el rango'. However, the problem statement requires the program to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

The program also does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for the values of n that it does handle. For example, when n is 2, the program prints the pattern '##..' and '..##', but it does not print the correct pattern for the second row of the checkerboard.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should use a loop to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n. The loop should iterate over each row of the checkerboard, and for each row, it should iterate over each column, printing '#' if the row and column indices are both even or both odd, and '.' otherwise.

Correctness: **False**
