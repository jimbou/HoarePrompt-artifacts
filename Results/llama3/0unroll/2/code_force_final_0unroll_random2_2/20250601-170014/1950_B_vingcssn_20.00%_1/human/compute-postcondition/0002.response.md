Functionality: **This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the size of a pattern to be printed. For each n, the function prints a pattern of '#' and '.' characters, with '#' forming a border around a '.' filled interior, if n is between 1 and 4 (inclusive). If n is outside this range, it prints the message 'No esta en el rango'. The function repeats this process for each test case, concatenating the output patterns.**
