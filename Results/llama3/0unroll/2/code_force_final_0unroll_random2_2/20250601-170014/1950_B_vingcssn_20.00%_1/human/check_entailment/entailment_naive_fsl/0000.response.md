Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. It only handles the cases where n is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and for any other value of n, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish). However, the problem description does not specify that n will only be one of these values. In fact, it states that n can be any integer between 1 and 20.

For example, if n is 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango", which is not a correct checkerboard pattern. A correct implementation should be able to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n between 1 and 20.
