Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard made of 2 x 2 squares alternating '#' and '.' characters, with the top-left cell being '#'. However, the program only handles cases where n is between 1 and 4 (inclusive) and prints a fixed pattern for each case. It does not generate the correct pattern for n greater than 4. Additionally, the program prints 'No esta en el rango' for n outside the range of 1 to 4, which is not the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
