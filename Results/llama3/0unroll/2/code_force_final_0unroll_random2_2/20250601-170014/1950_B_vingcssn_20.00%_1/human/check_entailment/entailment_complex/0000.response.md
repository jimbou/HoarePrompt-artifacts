Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. The problem description asks to output a 2n x 2n checkerboard made of 2 x 2 squares alternating '#' and '.' characters, with the top-left cell being '#'. However, the provided program only handles cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and prints a fixed pattern for each case. It does not generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n.

Moreover, the program prints 'No esta en el rango' for any value of n outside the range of 1 to 4, which is not the expected output according to the problem description.

A correct solution would involve using nested loops to generate the checkerboard pattern for any value of n, without relying on hardcoded patterns for specific values of n.

Correctness: **False**
