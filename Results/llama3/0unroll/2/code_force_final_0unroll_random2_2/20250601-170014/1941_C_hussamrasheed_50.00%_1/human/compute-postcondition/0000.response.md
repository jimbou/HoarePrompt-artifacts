The code accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Since the first input is accepted and assigned to `t`, the stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^6), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) and then a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
