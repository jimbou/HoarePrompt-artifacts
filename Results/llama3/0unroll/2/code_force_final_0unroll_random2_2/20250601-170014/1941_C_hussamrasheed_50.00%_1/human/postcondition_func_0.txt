This function reads a specified number of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each string, and prints their sum for each test case. The function consumes the contents of standard input and leaves the value of the initial test case count unchanged.
