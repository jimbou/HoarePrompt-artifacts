Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "map" and "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings and print 2, but the correct answer is 1 because only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The issue is that the program uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately, and then adds them together. However, this approach does not account for overlapping substrings. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle overlapping substrings correctly.
