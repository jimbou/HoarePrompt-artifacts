Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. The given program defines a function func() that reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string n and the string s.

3. The program then counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string s and stores it in the variable m. It then replaces all occurrences of 'map' in the string s with an empty string.

4. After replacing 'map', the program counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified string s and stores it in the variable p.

5. Finally, the program prints the sum of m and p, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful.

6. The program's approach is correct because it first removes all occurrences of 'map' and then counts the occurrences of 'pie'. This ensures that any overlapping occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' are handled correctly.

7. The program also handles the case where the string s is already beautiful by printing 0, as the sum of m and p will be 0 in this case.

Correctness: **True**
