Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the majority character in a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. The program reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of length 5. It then iterates over each string, counting the occurrences of A and B. Finally, it prints the character that appears most frequently in each string.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly reads the input, counts the occurrences of A and B, and prints the majority character. The program also handles the case where the counts of A and B are equal, in which case it prints B.

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
