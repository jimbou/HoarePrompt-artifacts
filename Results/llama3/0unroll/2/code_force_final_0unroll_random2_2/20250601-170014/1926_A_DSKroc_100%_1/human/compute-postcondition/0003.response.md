Functionality: **This function reads an integer `t` from standard input, followed by `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. It then determines the majority character in each string and prints the corresponding character ('A' or 'B') for each string. The function outputs a sequence of `t` characters, where each character represents the majority character in the corresponding input string.**
