The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains `t+1` inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 32) and then `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. Since the first input is accepted and assigned to `t`, the remaining inputs in the stdin are `t` strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, stdin contains `t` inputs: strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B**
