Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the most frequent character in a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. It iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the count for 'A' or 'B' accordingly. Then, it compares the counts and prints the character with the higher count.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* Strings with more 'A's than 'B's
* Strings with more 'B's than 'A's
* Strings with equal numbers of 'A's and 'B's (in which case it prints 'B', which is a valid solution)

The program also handles the edge case where the input string has a length of 5, as specified in the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
