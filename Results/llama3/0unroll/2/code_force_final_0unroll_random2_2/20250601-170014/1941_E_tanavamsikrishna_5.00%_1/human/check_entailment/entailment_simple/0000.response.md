Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost for each row and then finds the minimum sum of k consecutive elements in the costs list.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the dynamic programming approach and correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row. The use of list comprehension and generator expressions makes the code concise and efficient.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the number of rows is less than k, by only considering the sum of k consecutive elements up to the (len(costs) - k + 1)th element.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
