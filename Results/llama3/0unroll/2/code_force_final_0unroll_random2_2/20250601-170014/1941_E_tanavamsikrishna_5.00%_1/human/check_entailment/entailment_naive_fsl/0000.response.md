Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for building k bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row. It initializes the first `d-1` elements of the row to `row[i] + 1`, which represents the cost of installing a support at each of these positions. Then, it iterates over the rest of the row, calculating the minimum cost of installing a support at each position by considering the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` positions.

2. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, calculates the costs for each row using `func_1`, and then calculates the total costs for each possible set of k consecutive rows. It finally prints the minimum total cost.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When k is 1, it correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row.
* When k is greater than 1, it correctly calculates the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows.
* When d is 1, it correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row, considering only the previous position.
* When d is greater than 1, it correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row, considering the previous `d+1` positions.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
