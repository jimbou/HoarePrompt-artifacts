Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges across a river. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d` as input. It increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by 1, updates the rest of the elements to be the sum of the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements and the original value plus 1, and returns the last element of the updated list. This function is used to calculate the cost of building a bridge across a single row of the river.

`func_2` takes the number of rows `n`, columns `m`, bridges `k`, and maximum distance `d` as input, as well as a 2D list of river depths `rows`. It calculates the cost of building a bridge across each row using `func_1`, stores these costs in a list `costs`, and then calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements in `costs` to get the total cost of building `k` bridges. Finally, it prints the minimum of these total costs.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. It correctly calculates the cost of building a bridge across each row, and then finds the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges by considering all possible consecutive rows.

Correctness: **True**
