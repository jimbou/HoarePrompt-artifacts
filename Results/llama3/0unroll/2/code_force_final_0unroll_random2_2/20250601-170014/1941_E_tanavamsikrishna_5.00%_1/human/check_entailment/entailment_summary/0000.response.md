Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges across a river. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a row and a positive integer `d` representing the maximum distance between supports. It updates the list by incrementing the first `d-1` elements by 1 and then updates the rest of the elements to be the sum of the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements and the original value plus 1. The function returns the last element of the updated list, which represents the total cost of building a bridge across the river with the given maximum distance between supports.

`func_2` takes as input the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance, as well as a 2D list of river depths. It calculates the total cost of building a bridge across each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in a list. Then, it calculates the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements in the list of costs, where `k` is the number of bridges. This minimum sum represents the minimum total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges across the river.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements. It calculates the total cost of building a bridge across each row, considering the maximum distance between supports, and then finds the minimum sum of `k` consecutive costs. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
