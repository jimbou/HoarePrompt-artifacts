Output State: **n, m, k, and d are positive integers, n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. rows is a 2D list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells. costs is a list of integers representing the costs of each row, total_costs is an empty list. stdin contains no input.**

The first line reads four space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, k, and d, respectively. This line consumes the input from stdin, leaving it empty. The second line reads n lines from stdin, each containing m space-separated non-negative integers, and assigns them to rows. This line also consumes the remaining input from stdin, leaving it empty. The third line applies the function func_1 to each row in rows, passing d as an argument, and assigns the results to costs. The fourth line initializes an empty list total_costs.
