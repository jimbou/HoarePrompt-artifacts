Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the bits of the number x from most significant to least significant, and for each bit, it checks if the number of 1s in the corresponding bit positions of the array a is even or odd. If it's even, it tries to split the array into segments such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is 0, and updates the maximum number of segments found so far. If it's odd, it checks if the number of 1s is equal to the number of segments found so far, and if not, it returns -1.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the input array is empty or the number x is 0. It also correctly handles the case where the number of 1s in the array is odd, and the case where the number of segments found is 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
