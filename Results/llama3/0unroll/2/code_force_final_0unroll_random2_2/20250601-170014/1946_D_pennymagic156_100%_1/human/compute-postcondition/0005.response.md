Functionality: This function takes no parameters and returns the maximum value between the maximum number of pairs of elements in a list 'a' that have the same i-th bit and the total number of non-negative integers less than 2^30 in list 'a'. It operates on a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 and a non-negative integer less than 2^30, and modifies the list by potentially splitting it into pairs of elements with the same i-th bit. The function returns an integer value representing the maximum of these two quantities.
