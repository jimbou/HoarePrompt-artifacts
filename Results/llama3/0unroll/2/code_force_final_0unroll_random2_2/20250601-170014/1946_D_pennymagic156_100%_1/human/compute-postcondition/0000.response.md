Output State: **n is a positive integer, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^30, t is an empty list, ans is -1**

The code snippet consists of four lines. The first line calls the function `func_3()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `x`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, these values are updated accordingly. The second line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns its return value to `a`. Given that `a` is initially a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^30, this line updates the list `a` with new values. The third line initializes an empty list `t` and assigns it to the variable `t`. The fourth line assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ans`.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers less than 2^30 (updated by the `func_1()` call), `t` is an empty list, and `ans` is `-1`.
