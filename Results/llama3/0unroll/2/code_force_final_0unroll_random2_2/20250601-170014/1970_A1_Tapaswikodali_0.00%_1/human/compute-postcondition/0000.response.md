Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and representing a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, balance is 0, details is an empty list, stdin is empty.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the input string from stdin to the variable `s`. Since the input string is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and representing a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `s` becomes this string. The second line initializes the variable `balance` to 0. The third line initializes the variable `details` to an empty list. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty because the input string has been read and assigned to `s`.
