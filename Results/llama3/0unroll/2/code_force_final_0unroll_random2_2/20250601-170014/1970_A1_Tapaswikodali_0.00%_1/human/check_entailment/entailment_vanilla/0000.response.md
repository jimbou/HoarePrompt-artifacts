Reasoning:

1. The program first reads the input string `s` and initializes an empty list `details` to store the prefix balance and position of each character in the input sequence.

2. It then iterates over the input string, calculating the prefix balance at each position by incrementing the balance when it encounters an opening parenthesis and decrementing it when it encounters a closing parenthesis.

3. For each character, it appends a tuple to the `details` list containing the prefix balance, the negative of the position (to simulate decreasing order of position when sorting), and the character itself.

4. After processing the entire input string, it sorts the `details` list based on the prefix balance and position.

5. Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters in the sorted order and prints the result.

Based on the provided problem description and the given Python program, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
