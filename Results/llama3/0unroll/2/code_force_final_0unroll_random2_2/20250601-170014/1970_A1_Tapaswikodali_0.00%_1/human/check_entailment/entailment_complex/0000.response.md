Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the balance of the input string by iterating over each character and incrementing or decrementing the balance accordingly.
2. The program stores the balance, negative index, and character at each position in the `details` list. The use of negative index is correct, as it ensures that when sorting the list, the characters with the same balance are ordered in decreasing order of their original position.
3. The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and negative index, which is correct according to the problem description.
4. The program extracts the characters from the sorted `details` list and joins them into a single string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string.
5. The program prints the resulting string, which is the correct output.

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement, and it handles the edge cases correctly (e.g., the input string is non-empty and has a length not exceeding 500,000).

Correctness: **True**
