Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly calculates the balance of each prefix of the input string by incrementing the balance for each opening parenthesis and decrementing it for each closing parenthesis.
2.  It stores the balance, negative index, and character in a list of tuples, which allows for efficient sorting later.
3.  The program sorts the list of tuples based on the balance and negative index, which is in line with the problem's definition of the balanced shuffle operation.
4.  After sorting, the program extracts the characters from the sorted list of tuples and joins them into a string, which represents the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.
5.  Finally, the program prints the resulting string, which is the expected output.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, taking a non-empty string of balanced parentheses, rearranging the characters based on their balance and negative index, and printing the rearranged string.

Correctness: **True**
