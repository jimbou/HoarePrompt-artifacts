Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the position of the house after which the road should be laid, as described in the problem statement. The program iterates through the string `s` and checks for each position `i` whether the number of zeros on the left side and the number of ones on the right side are both at least 50% of the total number of houses on their respective sides. If this condition is met, the position `i` is added to the list `lst`. The program then finds the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference with the middle of the village (`pk`) and returns the smallest such position.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly. If no position `i` satisfies the condition, the program checks the percentage of ones in the entire string and returns either 0 or `n` accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
