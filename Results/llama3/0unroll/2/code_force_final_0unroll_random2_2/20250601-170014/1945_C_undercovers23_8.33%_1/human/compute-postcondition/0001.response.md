Output State: **The output state is a list of integers, where each integer represents the index of the first occurrence of a substring in the input string `s` that has at least 50% zeros and at least 50% ones. If no such substring exists, the output is either 0 (if the percentage of ones in the entire string is less than 50%) or the length of the string `n` (if the percentage of ones is greater than or equal to 50%). The list is sorted in ascending order. The state of `t` remains unchanged.**
