Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (3 <= n <= 3*10^5) and then a string a of length n, consisting only of 0 and 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input from the stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin now contains one less test case, with each test case still having two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of 0 and 1.
