This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing only 0s and 1s. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring in s that has at least 50% zeros and at least 50% ones. If no such substring exists, it returns either 0 (if the percentage of ones in the entire string is less than 50%) or the length of the string n (if the percentage of ones is greater than or equal to 50%). The function returns a list of these indices, sorted in ascending order, for each test case.
