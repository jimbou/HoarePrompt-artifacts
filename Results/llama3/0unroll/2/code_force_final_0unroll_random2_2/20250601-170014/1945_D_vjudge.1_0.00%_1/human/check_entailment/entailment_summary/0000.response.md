Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum sum of elements from two lists. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result. The function reads four lines of input: an integer, two integers n and k, and two lists of n integers each. It then calculates the sum of elements from the first list and the sum of elements from the second list, considering the constraint k. Finally, it prints the minimum sum of elements from the two lists, considering all possible combinations.

`func_2` reads an integer from standard input representing the number of test cases, then calls `func_1` for each test case. After all test cases have been processed, the function leaves the standard input empty and the number of test cases is set to 0.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum sum of elements from the two lists, considering the constraint k, and `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
