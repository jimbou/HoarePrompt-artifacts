This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the minimum sum of elements from two lists. It takes no parameters and returns no value, but instead prints the result. The function reads four lines of input: an integer, two integers n and k, and two lists of n integers each. It then calculates the sum of elements from the first list and the sum of elements from the second list, considering the constraint k. Finally, it prints the minimum sum of elements from the two lists, considering all possible combinations.
