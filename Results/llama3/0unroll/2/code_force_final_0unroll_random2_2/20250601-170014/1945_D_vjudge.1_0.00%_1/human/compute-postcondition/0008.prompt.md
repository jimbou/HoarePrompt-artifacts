You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple sets of inputs: the first line contains an integer, the second line contains two integers n and k such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200000, the third line contains n integers, and the fourth line contains n integers.
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: n remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, lista_A remains unchanged, lista_B remains unchanged, stdin remains unchanged, pref is the sum of all elements in lista_A from index 0 to n-k-1 plus the sum of all elements in lista_B from index 0 to n-k-1, and soma_b is the sum of all elements in lista_B from index n-k to n-1.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The variable resultado is assigned the minimum value between the current value of resultado and the sum of pref, soma_b, and the current element of lista_A. The variable soma_b is updated by adding the current element of lista_B.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: minimum value between the current value of resultado and the sum of pref, soma_b, and the current element of lista_A

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
