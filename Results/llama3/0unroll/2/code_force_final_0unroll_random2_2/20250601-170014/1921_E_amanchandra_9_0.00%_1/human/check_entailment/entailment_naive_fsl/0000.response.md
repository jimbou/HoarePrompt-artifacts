Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column. In this case, the program should check if Alice can reach Bob's position in the same column, but the program does not do this. 

For example, if the input is `10 10 1 1 10 1`, the program will output `Draw`, but the correct output should be `Alice` because Alice can reach Bob's position in the same column.

The program only checks if Alice can reach Bob's position in a diagonal direction, but it does not check if Alice can reach Bob's position in the same column. This is a missing logic in the program.
