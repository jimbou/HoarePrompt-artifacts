Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where `xa > xb` by immediately printing 'Draw', as Alice cannot win in this scenario.
2.  When `xa <= xb`, the program calculates the number of rows `x` that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's row. If `x` is odd, it means Alice will move an odd number of times, and Bob will move an even number of times. In this case, the program checks if Alice can win by moving to the column where Bob is. It calculates the left and right boundaries `l` and `r` that Alice can reach and checks if Bob's column `ya` is within these boundaries. If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
3.  If `x` is even, it means Alice will move an even number of times, and Bob will move an odd number of times. In this case, the program checks if Bob can win by moving to the column where Alice is. It calculates the left and right boundaries `l` and `r` that Bob can reach and checks if Alice's column `yb` is within these boundaries. If it is, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

The program correctly handles all possible scenarios and prints the correct outcome for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
