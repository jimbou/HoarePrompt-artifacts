Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the winner of the game for each test case based on the initial positions of Alice and Bob on the grid.

The program first checks if Alice's initial position is below Bob's initial position. If so, it immediately prints 'Draw' because Alice cannot win in this case.

If Alice's initial position is not below Bob's, the program calculates the number of rows (x) that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's row. If the number of rows is odd, it means that Alice will have the opportunity to capture Bob. The program then calculates the range of columns (l and r) that Alice can reach in the next move. If Alice's current column (ya) is within this range, it means that Alice can capture Bob, and the program prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

If the number of rows is even, it means that Bob will have the opportunity to capture Alice. The program calculates the range of columns (l and r) that Bob can reach in the next move. If Bob's current column (yb) is within this range, it means that Bob can capture Alice, and the program prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
