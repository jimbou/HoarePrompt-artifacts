Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5) and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the number of test cases is between 1 and 10^4, the value of `t` will be an integer within this range. The rest of the input remains unchanged, still containing multiple test cases with two inputs each: an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
