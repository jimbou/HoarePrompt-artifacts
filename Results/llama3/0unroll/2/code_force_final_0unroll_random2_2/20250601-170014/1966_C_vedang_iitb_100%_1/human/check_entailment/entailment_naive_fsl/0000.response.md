Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the `mexsize` variable. The `mexsize` is supposed to be the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array `a`. However, the program increments `mexsize` only when it finds a matching element in the array, which is not the correct way to calculate the `mexsize`.

For example, consider the input `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. The correct `mexsize` for this input is 1, because 1 is the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. However, the program will calculate `mexsize` as 2, because it increments `mexsize` when it finds the element 2 in the array.

This incorrect calculation of `mexsize` will lead to incorrect results in the program. For instance, in the example mentioned above, the program will print "Bob" as the winner, whereas the correct winner is "Alice".

To fix this issue, the program should correctly calculate the `mexsize` by iterating through the array and checking for the presence of each positive integer. If a positive integer is not present in the array, it should be considered as the `mexsize`.
