Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of strings, either 'Alice' or 'Bob', printed to the console, each corresponding to the result of a test case. The number of strings printed is equal to the initial value of `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the stdin is empty after all test cases have been processed.
