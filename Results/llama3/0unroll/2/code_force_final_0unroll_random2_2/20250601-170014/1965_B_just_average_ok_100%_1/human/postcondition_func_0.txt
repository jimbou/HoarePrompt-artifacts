This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of numbers containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, excluding the power of 2 greater than k, and including three additional numbers: k minus the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k, k plus 1, and k plus the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k plus 1. The function then prints the length of this list and its elements.
