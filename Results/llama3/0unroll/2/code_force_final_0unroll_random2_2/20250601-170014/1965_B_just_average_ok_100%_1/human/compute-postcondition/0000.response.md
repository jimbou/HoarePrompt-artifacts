Output State: **The output state will contain the number of elements in the list "nums" and the elements in the list "nums" for each iteration of the loop. The number of elements in "nums" will be 5 for each iteration, and the elements will be the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20, excluding the power of 2 that is greater than k, and including k - 2^idx, k + 1, and k + 2^idx + 1, where idx is the index of the power of 2 that is greater than k.**
