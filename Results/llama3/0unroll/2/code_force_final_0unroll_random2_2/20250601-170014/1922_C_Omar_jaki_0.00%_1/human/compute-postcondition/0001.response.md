Output State: **The loop iterates through all test cases, processing each one by calculating the differences between consecutive elements in the list a, and then using these differences to calculate the cumulative sum of these differences in two lists b. For each test case, it then prints the list b and the string 'B', followed by the results of the queries for each pair of indices (x_i, y_i).**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has processed all test cases, calculated the differences between consecutive elements in each list, and printed the results of the queries for each pair of indices. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as the input test cases, remains unchanged.
