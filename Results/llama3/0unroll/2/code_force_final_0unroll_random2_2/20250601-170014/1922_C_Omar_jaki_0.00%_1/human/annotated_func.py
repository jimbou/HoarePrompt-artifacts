#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer n, then a list of n unique integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in ascending order, then an integer m, and finally m pairs of integers x_i and y_i (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i).
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        print(b, 'B')
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: The loop iterates through all test cases, processing each one by calculating the differences between consecutive elements in the list a, and then using these differences to calculate the cumulative sum of these differences in two lists b. For each test case, it then prints the list b and the string 'B', followed by the results of the queries for each pair of indices (x_i, y_i).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of a list of unique integers in ascending order and a set of queries. The function calculates the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list and uses this information to answer queries about the sum of differences between any two indices in the list. The function prints the cumulative sum list and the results of each query.
