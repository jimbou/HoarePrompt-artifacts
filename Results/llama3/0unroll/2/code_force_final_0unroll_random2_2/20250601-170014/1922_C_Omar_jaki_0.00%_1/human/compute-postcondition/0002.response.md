Functionality: This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads a list of unique integers in ascending order and calculates the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements in two separate lists. It then prints these lists along with the results of queries for pairs of indices. The function iterates through all test cases, processing each one independently.
