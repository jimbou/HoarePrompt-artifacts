Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of a list of unique integers in ascending order and a set of queries. The function calculates the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list and uses this information to answer queries about the sum of differences between any two indices in the list. The function prints the cumulative sum list and the results of each query.**
