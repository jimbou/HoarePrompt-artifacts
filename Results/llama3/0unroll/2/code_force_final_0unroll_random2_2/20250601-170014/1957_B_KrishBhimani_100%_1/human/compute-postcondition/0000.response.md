Output State: **The output state will contain t lines, each representing the result of the corresponding input. For each input, if n is 1, the output will be k. If n is greater than 1, the output will be a list of n numbers, where the first number is the largest power of 2 less than k, the second number is k minus the first number, and the remaining numbers are 0.**
