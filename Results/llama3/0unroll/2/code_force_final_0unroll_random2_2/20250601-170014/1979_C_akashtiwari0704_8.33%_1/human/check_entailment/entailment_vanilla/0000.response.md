Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.

3. It calculates the product `prod` of all multipliers.

4. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the bet amount as `prod // a[i]`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `prod / a[i]`. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is minimized.

5. It calculates the total sum `sumo` of all bet amounts.

6. If the total sum `sumo` is greater than or equal to the product `prod`, it means that there is no way to distribute the coins as required, so it prints `-1`.

7. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts for each outcome.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum bet amounts for each outcome such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. If no such distribution is possible, it correctly prints `-1`.

Correctness: **True**
