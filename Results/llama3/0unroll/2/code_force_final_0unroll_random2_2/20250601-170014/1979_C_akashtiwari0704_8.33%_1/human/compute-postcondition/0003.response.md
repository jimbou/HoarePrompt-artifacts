Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer 'bets' and a list of 'bets' integers, calculates the product of all integers, and then for each integer, it calculates the product of all other integers. If the sum of these products is greater than or equal to the total product, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the list of products separated by spaces. This process is repeated for all test cases.**
