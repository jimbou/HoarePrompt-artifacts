Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time processing a test case. For each test case, it will read an integer `bets` and a list of `bets` integers `a`. It will then calculate the product of all elements in `a` and store it in `prod`. Next, it will iterate over `a` again, replacing each element with `prod` divided by the element, and summing up these values in `sumo`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it will print `-1`. Otherwise, it will print the modified list `a` with each element separated by a space. The loop will then move on to the next test case. After all test cases have been processed, the loop will terminate.
