Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is a list of multipliers that are not pairwise coprime. In such cases, the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers may not be equal to their product, and the program's calculation of the bets based on the product of the multipliers will be incorrect.

For example, consider the input [2, 4, 6]. The LCM of these numbers is 12, but their product is 48. The program will calculate the bets as [24, 12, 8], which sums to 44. However, the correct bets should be [6, 3, 2], which sums to 11 and is less than the LCM of 12.

The program assumes that the multipliers are pairwise coprime, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. Therefore, it does not work correctly for all possible inputs.
