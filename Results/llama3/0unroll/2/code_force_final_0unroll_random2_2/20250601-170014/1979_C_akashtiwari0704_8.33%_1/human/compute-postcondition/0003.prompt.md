You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). The second line contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 <= k_i <= 20).
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time processing a test case. For each test case, it will read an integer `bets` and a list of `bets` integers from the input. It will then calculate the product of all the integers, and for each integer, it will calculate the product of all other integers by dividing the total product by the current integer. The sum of these products will be calculated. If the sum is greater than or equal to the total product, the loop will print `-1`. Otherwise, it will print the list of products separated by spaces. The loop will repeat this process for all `t` test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
