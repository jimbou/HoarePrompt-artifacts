Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to determine how to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program works by first calculating the product of all the multipliers (k_i). Then, for each multiplier, it calculates the product of all other multipliers by dividing the total product by the current multiplier. The sum of these products is calculated, and if it is greater than or equal to the total product, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the list of products separated by spaces, which represents the bets on each outcome.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This is achieved by calculating the product of all other multipliers for each outcome and summing them up. If the sum is greater than or equal to the total product, it means that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is not strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, and therefore, the program prints -1.

Correctness: **True**
