Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, each time processing a test case. For each test case, it will read an integer `bets` and a list of `bets` integers from the input. It will then calculate the product of all the integers, and for each integer, it will calculate the product of all other integers by dividing the total product by the current integer. The sum of these products will be calculated. If the sum is greater than or equal to the total product, the loop will print `-1`. Otherwise, it will print the list of products separated by spaces. The loop will repeat this process for all `t` test cases.
