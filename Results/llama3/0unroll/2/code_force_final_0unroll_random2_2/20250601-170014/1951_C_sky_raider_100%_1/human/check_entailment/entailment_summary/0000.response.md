Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the way it calculates the cumulative sum. The program adds the minimum of m and k to the cumulative sum t, and then multiplies the result with the current integer and the cumulative sum. However, this is incorrect because the cumulative sum t should be added to the current integer, not multiplied.

The correct approach would be to add the minimum of m and k to the cumulative sum t, and then multiply the result with the current integer. This is because the price of the tickets increases by the number of tickets purchased, so the cumulative sum t should be added to the current integer to get the correct price.

Here is the corrected code:

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        t = 0
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += s * (l[i] + t)
            t += s
            k -= s
            if k == 0:
                break
        print(int(c))

Correctness: **False**
