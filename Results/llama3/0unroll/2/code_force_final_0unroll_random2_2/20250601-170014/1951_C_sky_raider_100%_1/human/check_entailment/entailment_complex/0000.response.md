Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires that the price per ticket for each subsequent day be increased by the number of tickets purchased on the current day. However, the program does not correctly implement this constraint.

In the program, the variable `t` is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of the number of tickets purchased, and this value is added to the current price `l[i]` to calculate the cost of purchasing tickets on the current day. However, this is incorrect because the price increase should only be applied to the subsequent days, not to the current day.

Furthermore, the program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be purchased `k` is greater than the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day `m`. In this case, the program will purchase more tickets than allowed on the current day, which is not valid according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem and produces incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
