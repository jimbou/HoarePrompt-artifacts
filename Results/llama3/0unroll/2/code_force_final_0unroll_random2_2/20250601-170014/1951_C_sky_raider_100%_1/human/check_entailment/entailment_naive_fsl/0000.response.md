Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The problem statement requires that the prices per ticket for each day be updated after purchasing tickets on a previous day, but the program does not account for this. It simply sorts the prices and then calculates the total cost by multiplying the number of tickets purchased on each day by the price of the ticket on that day, without considering the updated prices.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will sort the prices to get [2, 4, 6, 8] and then calculate the total cost as:

* 2 tickets on day 1: 2 * 2 = 4
* 1 ticket on day 2: 1 * 4 = 4
* 0 tickets on day 3: 0 * 6 = 0
* 0 tickets on day 4: 0 * 8 = 0

Total cost: 4 + 4 = 8

However, this is not the correct solution. The correct solution would be to purchase 1 ticket on day 3 with cost 4, and then purchase 2 tickets on day 4 with cost 6, for a total cost of 10.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to update the prices per ticket for each day after purchasing tickets on a previous day, and therefore does not produce the correct solution.
