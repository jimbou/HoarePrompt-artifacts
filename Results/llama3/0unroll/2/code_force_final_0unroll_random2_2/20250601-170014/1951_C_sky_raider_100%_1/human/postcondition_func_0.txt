This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, and the second line contains n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, then iterates through the sorted list, calculating a cumulative sum by multiplying the minimum of m and k with the current integer and the cumulative sum, and adding the result to the total sum. The function prints the total sum for each test case.
