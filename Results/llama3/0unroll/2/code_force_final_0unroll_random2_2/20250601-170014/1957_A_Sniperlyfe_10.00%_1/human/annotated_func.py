#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique stick lengths from `arr` and the values are the frequencies of each length.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the total number of times the length of sticks can be divided into groups of 4, where the length of each stick is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the frequency of each length is stored in the dictionary `freq`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers representing stick lengths as input, counts the frequency of each length, and returns the total number of times the sticks can be divided into groups of 4 based on their lengths.
