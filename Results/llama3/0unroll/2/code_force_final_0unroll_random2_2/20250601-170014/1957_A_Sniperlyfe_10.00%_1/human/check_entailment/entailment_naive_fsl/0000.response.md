Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that it only considers the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with 4 sides (squares), but it does not consider the possibility of forming polygons with more than 4 sides.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program will output 0, but the correct answer is 1, because we can form a hexagon with 6 sides.

The program should be modified to consider the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with any number of sides, not just 4.
