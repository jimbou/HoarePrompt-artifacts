Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and all integers are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, the list `arr` remains unchanged, still containing integers representing stick lengths between 1 and 100. The new variable `freq` is introduced as an empty dictionary, which will likely be used to store frequency counts of stick lengths in subsequent code.
