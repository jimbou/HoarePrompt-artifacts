The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains multiple test cases. The first integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) represents the number of test cases. This integer is read and assigned to the variable `loop`. 

The value of `loop` is now equal to `t`, which is the number of test cases. The stdin now contains the remaining test cases, each starting with an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100), followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `a` and `x` (`a` in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).

Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100), followed by n lines, each containing two integers a and x (a in {1,2,3}, 1 <= x <= 10^9).**
