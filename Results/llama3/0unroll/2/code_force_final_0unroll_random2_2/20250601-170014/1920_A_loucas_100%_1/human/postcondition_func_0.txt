This function reads input from the console, processes multiple test cases, and prints the count of numbers within a specific range for each test case. It accepts no parameters and returns no values, instead, it prints the results directly to the console. The function iterates over the input test cases, categorizes numbers into three lists based on their values, calculates the range, and then adjusts the count by subtracting numbers that fall within the range from the 'no' list. The final state of the program is a series of printed numbers, each representing the adjusted count for a test case.
