Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be the number of test cases that have a valid range of numbers (i.e., the difference between the minimum of the "less" list and the maximum of the "big" list is greater than or equal to 1) minus the number of "no" values that fall within this range. The output will be a series of integers, one for each test case, representing the number of valid ranges minus the number of "no" values within those ranges.
