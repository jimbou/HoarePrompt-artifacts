Reasoning:

1. The program first checks if the length of the input string `s` is 1. If it is, it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.

2. If the length of `s` is greater than 1, it checks if all characters in `s` are the same (i.e., `len(set(s)) == 1`). If they are, it prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange the characters to form a different string.

3. If the length of `s` is greater than 1 and not all characters are the same, it generates a random permutation of the characters in `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. It then checks if the generated permutation `s2` is the same as the original string `s`. If it is, it generates a new permutation by moving the first character of `s` to the end.

4. Finally, it prints 'Yes' and the generated permutation `s2`.

The program is correct because it correctly handles all possible cases:

- If the input string has only one character, it correctly prints 'No'.
- If the input string has more than one character but all characters are the same, it correctly prints 'No'.
- If the input string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, it correctly generates a different permutation of the characters and prints 'Yes' and the permutation.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the case where the length of `s` is greater than 1 and not all characters are the same, the program generates a random permutation of the characters. If the generated permutation happens to be the same as the original string, the program generates a new permutation by moving the first character of `s` to the end. This new permutation is not necessarily a random permutation of the characters, which could be a problem if the problem statement requires a random permutation.

But based on the problem description, it seems that any permutation that is different from the original string is acceptable, so this issue does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
