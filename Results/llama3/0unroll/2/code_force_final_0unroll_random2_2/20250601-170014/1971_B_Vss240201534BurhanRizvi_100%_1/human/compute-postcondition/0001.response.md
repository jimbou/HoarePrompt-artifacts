Functionality: **This function takes a series of strings as input and outputs a shuffled version of each string. If a string has a length of 1 or contains only identical characters, it outputs 'No'. Otherwise, it outputs 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of the string. If the shuffled string is identical to the original, it moves the first character to the end of the string. The function processes multiple strings, with the number of strings specified by the first input.**
