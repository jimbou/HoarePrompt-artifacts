Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has more than one character and all characters are the same, but the length of the string is greater than 2. In this case, the program will print "Yes" and then print the original string, which is not a rearrangement of the original string.

For example, if the input is "aaa", the program will print "Yes" and then print "aaa", which is not a rearrangement of the original string. The correct output should be "No" because it is impossible to rearrange the characters of "aaa" to form a new string that is not equal to "aaa".
