Output State: **The output state will contain 't' number of outputs, where 't' is the first input provided. Each output will be either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a shuffled string. If the input string has a length of 1 or all characters are the same, the output will be 'No'. Otherwise, the output will be 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of the input string. If the shuffled string is the same as the original string, the first character will be moved to the end of the string.**
