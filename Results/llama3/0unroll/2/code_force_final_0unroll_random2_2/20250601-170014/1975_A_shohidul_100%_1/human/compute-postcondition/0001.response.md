Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, if the list of integers is either already sorted in non-decreasing order or can be made sorted by removing a prefix of the list, 'YES' will be printed. Otherwise, 'NO' will be printed. The value of `t` will remain unchanged.**
