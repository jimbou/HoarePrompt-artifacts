The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two inputs, the first input is an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50). This integer `n` is assigned to the variable `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one input: a list of `t` integers**
