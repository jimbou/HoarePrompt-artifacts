This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It checks if the list is already sorted in non-decreasing order or can be made sorted by removing a prefix of the list. For each test case, it prints 'YES' to the console if the list is sorted or can be made sorted, and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
