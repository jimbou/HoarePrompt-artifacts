Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "NO" because the array cannot become non-decreasing after performing the operation any number of times.

However, the program has a logical error. It only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements of the new array, but it does not check if the new array is non-decreasing. 

For instance, if the input is:

3
5
7 9 2 2 3

The program will output "YES", but the correct output should be "YES" because the array can become non-decreasing after performing the operation any number of times.

The correct code should check if the new array is non-decreasing, not just if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements of the new array.

Here is the correct code:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:] + a[:i]
                    check_all_new = all([new[j - 1] <= new[j] for j in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
