Output State: **a is an empty list, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two binary strings of length n.**

The first line initializes an empty list `a`. The second line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. Since `n` is read from stdin, one test case is consumed, leaving multiple test cases - 1 in stdin. Each remaining test case still contains two binary strings of length `n`.
