Output State: The list s contains a binary string of length n, where the first i elements are from the first binary string in a, and the remaining elements are from the second binary string in a, where i is the smallest index such that the (i+1)th element of the first binary string is '1' and the ith element of the second binary string is '0'. If no such index exists, s contains the first binary string from a with the last element replaced by the last element of the second binary string in a. The value of x is the index i described above, or n-1 if no such index exists.
