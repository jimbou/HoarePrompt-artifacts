Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not a simple concatenation of the first and second rows. For example, when the input is:

3
2
01
10

The program will output "011 1", which is incorrect. The correct output should be "010 2".

The issue is that the program only checks for the first occurrence of '1' in the second row and then concatenates the rest of the first row with the rest of the second row. However, this approach does not consider all possible paths that can yield the lexicographically smallest string.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider all possible paths and find the lexicographically smallest string among them.
