Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the grid (n) and two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.
3. It attempts to find a prefix of the first string that matches a suffix of the second string. If such a match is found, it constructs the lexicographically smallest string by concatenating the prefix of the first string with the suffix of the second string.
4. If no match is found, it constructs the lexicographically smallest string by concatenating the first string with the last character of the second string.
5. It calculates the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string by finding the length of the matching prefix.
6. It prints the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. However, there are a few minor issues with the code:

* The function `func_1` is not necessary and can be removed. The code inside this function can be directly placed inside the loop that iterates over the test cases.
* The variable `x` is not necessary and can be removed. The index `i` can be used directly in the calculation of `t`.
* The variable `t` is not necessary and can be removed. The length of the matching prefix can be calculated directly and printed.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    s = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            break
    else:
        s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    t = 1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = len(s) - i
            break
    print(s, sep='')
    print(t)
```

Correctness: **True**
