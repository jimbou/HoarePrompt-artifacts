Output State: **`s` is a list containing a binary string of length `n`, `x` is an integer between 0 and `n - 1` inclusive, `a` is a list containing two binary strings of length `n`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `t` is 1**

In this output state, the values of `s`, `x`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `t` which is assigned the value 1.
