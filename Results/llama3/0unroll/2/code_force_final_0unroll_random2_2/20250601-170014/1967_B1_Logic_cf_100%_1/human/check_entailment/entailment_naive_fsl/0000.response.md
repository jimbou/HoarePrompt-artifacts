Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line where the program calculates the additional pairs for each value of b:

`ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`

This line is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that a and b must be positive integers. The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` can result in a non-integer value, which is not valid for the number of pairs.

For example, when n = 10 and b = 3, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` evaluates to `(10 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 13 // 9 = 1.444...`, which is not an integer. However, the program will still add this non-integer value to the total count of pairs, resulting in an incorrect answer.

To fix this issue, the program should only consider integer values of `(n + b) // (b * b)`, and it should also ensure that the resulting pairs (a, b) satisfy the condition that a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
