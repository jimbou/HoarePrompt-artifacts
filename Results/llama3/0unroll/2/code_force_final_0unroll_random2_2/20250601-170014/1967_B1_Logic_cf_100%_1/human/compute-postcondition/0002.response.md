Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans` will hold the value of the sum of `n` and the sum of the integer divisions of `n + b` by `b * b` for all `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m` (inclusive), and this value will be printed to the console for each test case. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the stdin will be empty after all test cases have been processed.**
