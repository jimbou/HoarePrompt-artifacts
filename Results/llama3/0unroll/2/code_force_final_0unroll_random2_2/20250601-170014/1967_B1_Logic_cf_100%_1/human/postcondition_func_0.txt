This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two positive integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates the sum of n and the sum of the integer divisions of n + b by b * b for all b from 2 to the minimum of n and m (inclusive), and prints this value to the console. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.
