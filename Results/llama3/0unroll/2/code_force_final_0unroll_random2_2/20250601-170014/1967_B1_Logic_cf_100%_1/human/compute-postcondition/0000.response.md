Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The remaining test cases still contain two positive integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
