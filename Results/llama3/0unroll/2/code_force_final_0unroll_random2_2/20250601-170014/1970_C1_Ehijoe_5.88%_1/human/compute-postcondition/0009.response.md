Output: **The variable t remains unchanged and is 1, the variable empty is False, the variable tree is a deque containing a path from the root of the tree to the node u, where u is the node on the last line of the input, the variable start is an integer read from stdin, the variable idx is the index of start in the deque tree, and the variable moves is a list containing two integers: the minimum of t and idx, and the minimum of t and the number of elements in tree minus idx minus 1. Stdin now contains one less input. All elements in the list moves are even, and 'Hermione' is printed**
