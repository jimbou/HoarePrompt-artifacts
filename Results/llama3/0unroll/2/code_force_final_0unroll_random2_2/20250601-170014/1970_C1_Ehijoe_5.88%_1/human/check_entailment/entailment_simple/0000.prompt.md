Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

t = 1
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t, where n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, and t is 1; then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n inclusive; and finally one line containing one integer u, where u is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: The variable t remains unchanged and is 1, the variable empty is False, and the variable tree is a deque containing a path from the root of the tree to the node u, where u is the node on the last line of the input.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *The variable t remains unchanged and is 1, the variable empty is False, the variable tree is a deque containing a path from the root of the tree to the node u, where u is the node on the last line of the input, the variable start is an integer read from stdin, the variable idx is the index of start in the deque tree, and the variable moves is a list containing two integers: the minimum of t and idx, and the minimum of t and the number of elements in tree minus idx minus 1. Stdin now contains one less input. If at least one of the moves in the list is an odd number, 'Ron' is printed. Otherwise, all elements in the list moves are even, and 'Hermione' is printed.
