Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly constructs the tree path from the root to the given node and determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the minimum moves required to reach the node from the start of the path. The program handles the case where the tree has exactly two leaves and the game is played with the same tree for each round. The program also correctly prints the winner's name to the console.

Correctness: **True**
