Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, t is 1, tree is an empty deque, empty is True, stdin contains n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, and one line containing one integer u.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first two inputs to `n` and `t`, respectively. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5 inclusive, and `t` is 1, these values are assigned to the variables. The second line creates an empty deque and assigns it to the variable `tree`. The third line assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `empty`. The remaining inputs in stdin are not affected by the code and remain the same.
