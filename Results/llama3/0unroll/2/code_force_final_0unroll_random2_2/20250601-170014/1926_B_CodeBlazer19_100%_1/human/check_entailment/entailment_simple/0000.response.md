Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' and if so, it immediately prints 'TRIANGLE'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the grid contains a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

Similarly, the program checks if a row contains more than one '1' and if so, it prints 'SQUARE'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the grid contains a square. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

To correctly determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square, the program needs to check the pattern of '1's in the grid more carefully. It needs to check if the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 for a triangle, or if the number of '1's is the same in each row and the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge for a square.

Correctness: **False**
