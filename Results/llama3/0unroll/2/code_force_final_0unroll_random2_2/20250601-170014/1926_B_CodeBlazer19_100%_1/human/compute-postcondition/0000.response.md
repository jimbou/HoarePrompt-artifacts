Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n strings of n characters each, consisting of '0' and '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1' s in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and n strings of n characters each, with the same properties as before. The values of the other variables are not affected.
