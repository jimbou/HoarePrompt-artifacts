Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' and if so, it immediately classifies the shape as a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row. The program also checks if a row contains more than one '1' and if so, it classifies the shape as a square. However, this is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a shape is a triangle or a square based on the problem description. It does not check the number of '1's in each row, nor does it check the position of the '1's in each row.

Correctness: **False**
