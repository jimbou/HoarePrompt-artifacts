Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The issue lies in the way it checks for triangles and squares. 

For triangles, it checks if there is exactly one '1' in a row, which is not a sufficient condition for a triangle. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

For squares, it checks if there is more than one '1' in a row, which is also not a sufficient condition. A square requires that the number of '1's in each row is the same, and that the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

A counterexample is a grid with the following shape:

```
000
011
111
```

This is a triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because it has more than one '1' in the second and third rows. 

To correctly identify the shape, the program needs to check the number of '1's in each row and their positions, and verify that they match the definition of a triangle or a square.
