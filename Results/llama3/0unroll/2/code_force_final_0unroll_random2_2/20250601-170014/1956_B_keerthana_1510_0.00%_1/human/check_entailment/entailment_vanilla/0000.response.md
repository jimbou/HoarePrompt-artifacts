Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by counting the number of elements that appear more than twice in the input list. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of points that can be scored by playing the cards optimally. The optimal strategy is to play the cards that have a pair on the table, and if no such card exists, play any card.

The given program is counting the number of elements that appear more than twice, which is not relevant to the problem. The correct approach would be to count the number of elements that appear exactly twice, as these are the cards that can be played to score points.

Moreover, the program is using the `//` operator to perform integer division, which is not necessary in this case. The `count` method returns an integer, and the `sum` function can handle integer values.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
