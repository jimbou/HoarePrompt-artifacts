Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game), and then a space-separated list of integers (the integers on the cards in your hand). The list of integers is of the same length as the first integer, and each integer in the list is between 1 and the first integer (inclusive), and each integer from 1 through the first integer appears in the list at most 2 times.**
