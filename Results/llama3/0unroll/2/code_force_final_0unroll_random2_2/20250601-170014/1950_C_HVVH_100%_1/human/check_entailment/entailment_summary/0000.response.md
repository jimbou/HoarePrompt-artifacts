Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly converts the input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the result in the required format. The program handles all possible cases, including midnight (00:00), noon (12:00), and times in the morning and afternoon.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to convert the time. It first checks if the hour is 0, in which case it sets the hour to 12 and the day indicator to 'AM'. If the hour is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the day indicator to 'PM'. Otherwise, it sets the day indicator to 'AM' unless the hour is 12, in which case it sets the day indicator to 'PM'.

The program also correctly handles the formatting of the output, using the `:02d` format specifier to ensure that the hour and minute are always displayed with two digits, padding with zeros if necessary.

Correctness: **True**
