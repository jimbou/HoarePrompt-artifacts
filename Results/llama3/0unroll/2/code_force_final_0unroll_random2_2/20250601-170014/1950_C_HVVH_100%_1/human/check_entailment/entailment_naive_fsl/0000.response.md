Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input hour is 12 correctly. According to the problem description, 12:00 should be output as 12:00 PM, but the program outputs it as 12:00 AM.

The issue is in the line `if h == 12: day = 'PM'`. This line is inside the `else` block, which means it only executes when `h` is not 0 and not greater than 12. However, when `h` is 12, this line should execute to set `day` to 'PM', but it doesn't because it's inside the `else` block.

To fix this, the line `if h == 12: day = 'PM'` should be moved outside the `else` block, so that it executes regardless of the value of `h`. Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all inputs.
