Functionality: **This function reads a series of time inputs in 24-hour format from standard input, converts them to 12-hour format, and prints each time in the format 'hh:mm AM/PM'. The number of time inputs is specified by an initial integer input. The function consumes all input from standard input and produces a corresponding number of output lines, with the day indicator ('AM' or 'PM') determined by the hour of each input time.**
