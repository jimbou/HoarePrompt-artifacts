Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to convert 24-hour format time to 12-hour format. It correctly handles the conversion logic for hours and minutes, and also determines the day indicator ('AM' or 'PM') based on the hour.

Here are the key points that support the correctness of the program:

1.  The program correctly handles the case when the hour is 0, setting it to 12 and the day to 'AM'.
2.  It correctly handles the case when the hour is greater than 12, subtracting 12 from the hour and setting the day to 'PM'.
3.  It correctly handles the case when the hour is 12, setting the day to 'PM'.
4.  It correctly handles the case when the hour is between 1 and 11, setting the day to 'AM'.
5.  The program uses the `map` function to split the input string into hours and minutes, and then uses the `int` function to convert them to integers.
6.  The program uses the `f-string` formatting to print the output in the required format, with leading zeroes for hours and minutes if necessary.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The variable `day` is initialized to 'AM' before the loop, but it is not necessary. The day can be determined solely based on the hour, and the variable `day` can be removed. Here's the corrected code:

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        if h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Correctness: **True**
