Correctness: **True**.

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The program uses the mathematical property that b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b if and only if (a, b) is a multiple of (x, y) where x and y are coprime and x + y divides both a and b.

The program iterates over all possible values of x and y, and for each pair, it calculates the number of multiples of (x, y) that satisfy the conditions. The program uses the math.gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor of x and y, and it uses the min function to ensure that the calculated multiples do not exceed the given values of n and m.

The program handles all possible cases, including the cases where n or m is 1, and it correctly calculates the number of valid pairs in each case. The program also handles the case where x + y does not divide both a and b, in which case the pair (a, b) is not valid.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and efficient, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
