Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to reach a target value k by subtracting 1 or n-k+1 from a given number n, where n and k are positive integers. It prints 'YES' if it is possible and 'NO' otherwise. If it is possible, it also prints the number of operations required (2) and the costs of the operations (n-k+1 and 1). If n equals k, it prints 'YES' and 1 twice. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO'. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the number of operations required and prints the result accordingly. The function does not return any value.**
