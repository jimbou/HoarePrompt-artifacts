Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two positive integers n and k as input, where n is the number of coins Alice has and k is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints "YES" and the number 1 twice, indicating that Bob can set up one stall with a price of 1, and Alice will buy exactly k jewels.

If n is not equal to k, the program checks if n is less than k. If it is, it prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

If n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the costs of the stalls. It first calculates the cost of the first stall as n - k + 1, and the cost of the second stall as 1. It then calculates the total number of jewels Alice can buy with these costs.

If the total number of jewels Alice can buy is less than k, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number 2, and the costs of the stalls.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
