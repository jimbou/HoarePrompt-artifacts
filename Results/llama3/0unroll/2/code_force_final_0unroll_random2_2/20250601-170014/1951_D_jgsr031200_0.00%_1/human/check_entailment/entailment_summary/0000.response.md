Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to reach a target value k by subtracting 1 or n-k+1 from a given number n, where n and k are positive integers. 

The program first checks if n equals k, in which case it prints 'YES' and 1 twice. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to reach k by subtracting 1 or n-k+1 from n. 

If n is greater than or equal to k, the program calculates the number of operations required to reach k. It does this by subtracting n-k+1 from n, which gives the number of operations required to reach k-1. Then, it subtracts 1 from n to reach k. 

The program prints 'YES' if it is possible to reach k, and 'NO' otherwise. If it is possible, it also prints the number of operations required (2) and the costs of the operations (n-k+1 and 1). 

Therefore, the program is correct and should print the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
