Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is 0**

In this output state, the values of n and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code creates a new list called costs and assigns it two elements: n - k + 1 and 1. The value of n - k + 1 is calculated using the initial values of n and k, but since n and k are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of this expression. The variable h is assigned the value 0.
