Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 10 and k = 5, the program prints "YES" and the costs [5, 1], but this is not a valid solution because Alice will buy 2 jewels at the first stall (cost 5) and 1 jewel at the second stall (cost 1), for a total of 3 jewels, not 5.

The issue is that the program only checks if the total number of jewels bought is less than or equal to k, but it does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought is exactly equal to k. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check if the total number of jewels bought is exactly equal to k, and if not, print "NO".
