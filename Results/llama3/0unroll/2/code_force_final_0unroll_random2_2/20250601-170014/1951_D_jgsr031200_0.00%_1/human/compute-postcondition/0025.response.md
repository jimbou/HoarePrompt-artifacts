The code prints the elements of the `costs` list.
Since `n` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is less than `k`, the first element of the `costs` list is `n - k + 1` which is `-k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.
Output: **-k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer)**
