Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where `n` equals `k`. In this case, it prints 'YES' and 1 twice, indicating that only one operation is required to reach the target value `k`.
2.  The program correctly handles the case where `n` is less than `k`. In this case, it prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to reach the target value `k` by subtracting 1 or `n-k+1` from `n`.
3.  The program correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. In this case, it calculates the number of operations required to reach the target value `k` and prints the result accordingly. If the number of operations required is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', the number of operations required (2), and the costs of the operations (`n-k+1` and 1).

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
