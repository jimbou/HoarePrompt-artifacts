You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers.
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged, still being equal to each other. The program has already printed 'YES' and the number 1 twice, but these prints do not affect the return value.
    #State: n and k are positive integers, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *n and k are positive integers, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n + k.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: -k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer)
    #State: *n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n + k. If h < k, 'NO' is printed. If h >= k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the elements of the costs list which are -k + 1 and 1 are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged, still being equal to each other. The program has already printed 'YES' and the number 1 twice, but these prints do not affect the return value.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k. The current value of h is less than k. costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1. The current value of h is n + k, and 'NO' is printed

Case_4: n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n + k, and h is larger than or equal to k, and the number 2 is being printed, and 'YES' is being printed, and the elements of the costs list which are -k + 1 and 1 are being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
