        #The program returns nothing, as there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The values of n and k remain unchanged, still being equal to each other. The program has already printed 'YES' and the number 1 twice, but these prints do not affect the return value.

    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO

        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: -k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer)
    #State: *n is 0, k is a positive integer, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two elements: n - k + 1 and 1, h is n + k. If h < k, 'NO' is printed. If h >= k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the elements of the costs list which are -k + 1 and 1 are printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether it is possible to reach a target value k by subtracting 1 or n-k+1 from a given number n, where n and k are positive integers. It prints 'YES' if it is possible and 'NO' otherwise. If it is possible, it also prints the number of operations required (2) and the costs of the operations (n-k+1 and 1). If n equals k, it prints 'YES' and 1 twice. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO'. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the number of operations required and prints the result accordingly. The function does not return any value.
