Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the number of "+" characters in the input string `expression` and then calculates the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty.

The reasoning behind this approach is that the optimal way to split the array is to group all the "+" characters together and all the "-" characters together. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so grouping all the "+" characters together will result in a sum of 1 multiplied by the length of the subarray, and similarly for the "-" characters.

By calculating the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters, the program is effectively calculating the minimum possible penalty that can be received.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
