Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The provided program calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters in the input string expression. This is equivalent to finding the absolute value of the sum of the array, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program correctly handles the conversion of the input string to an array of 1s and -1s, where "+" corresponds to 1 and "-" corresponds to -1. It then calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters, which gives the minimum possible penalty.

The execution summary also confirms that the program calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters, returning a non-negative integer value.

Correctness: **True**
