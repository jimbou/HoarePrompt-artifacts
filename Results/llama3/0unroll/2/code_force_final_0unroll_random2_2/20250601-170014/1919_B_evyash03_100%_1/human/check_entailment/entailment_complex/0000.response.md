Reasoning:

The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting a given array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters in the string `expression`. This is equivalent to calculating the absolute value of the sum of the array represented by the string.

Since the penalty for a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the length of the array is equal to the length of the string `expression`, the program is essentially calculating the penalty for the entire array.

The program does not explicitly split the array into subarrays, but it is not necessary to do so. The problem statement allows for the array to be split into subarrays in any way, as long as the sum of the subarrays is equal to the original array. Therefore, the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the entire array is considered as a single subarray.

Since the program correctly calculates the penalty for the entire array, and this is the minimum possible penalty, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
