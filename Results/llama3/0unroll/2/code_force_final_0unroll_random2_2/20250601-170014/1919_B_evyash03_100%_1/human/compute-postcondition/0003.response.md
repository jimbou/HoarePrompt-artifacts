The code calculates the value of `sub` by subtracting the number of "+" characters (`count`) from the total length of the expression (`length`). Since `length` is equal to the length of `expression` and `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, `sub` will be equal to the number of "-" characters in `expression`.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, `length` is a positive integer equal to the length of `expression`, `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, `sub` is the number of "-" characters in `expression`.**
