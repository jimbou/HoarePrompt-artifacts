Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty. It first counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, then calculates the absolute difference between the counts. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty, as it is the smallest possible sum of absolute values of the subarrays.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. For example, if the string consists only of '+' characters, the program correctly returns the length of the string as the minimum penalty. Similarly, if the string consists only of '-' characters, the program correctly returns the length of the string as the minimum penalty. If the string has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, the program correctly returns 0 as the minimum penalty.

The program also handles cases where the string has a mix of '+' and '-' characters. For example, if the string is "+-+-+--", the program correctly returns 2 as the minimum penalty.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty for all potential cases, and therefore, the correctness is **True**.
