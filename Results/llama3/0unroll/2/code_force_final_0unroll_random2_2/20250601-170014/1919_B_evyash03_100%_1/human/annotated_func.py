#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression.
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: Output State: expression is a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, length is a positive integer equal to the length of expression, count is the number of "+" characters in expression.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute difference between the number of "-" characters and the number of "+" characters in the string `expression`.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the absolute difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters in a given string expression, returning a non-negative integer value.
