Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains the rest of the test cases, which are t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin now contains the rest of the test cases, which are t-1 test cases. Each test case still consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).
