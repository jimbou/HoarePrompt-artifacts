Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:

The program does not correctly handle the case when the array has more than two elements and the operation needs to be applied multiple times. 

For example, consider the input:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will split the first element into [1, 2] and then compare it with the next element 3. Since 2 is less than 3, it will not split the next element 45. However, the correct operation would be to split 45 into [4, 5] and then compare it with the next element 67. 

The program does not handle this case correctly and will output "NO" for this input, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "YES".
