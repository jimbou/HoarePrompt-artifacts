Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array elements.
3. It initializes a variable `ans` to `True`, assuming that the array can be sorted.
4. It then iterates over the array from the second last element to the first element (in reverse order).
5. For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, it means that the array is not sorted.
6. To fix this, it tries to split the previous element into its digits and inserts them in the correct position. It does this by converting the previous element to a string, splitting it into individual digits, and then converting them back to integers.
7. It then checks if the resulting array is sorted. If it's not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
8. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly implements the problem statement and handles all edge cases. It's also efficient, with a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of test cases and m is the maximum length of the array.

Correctness: **True**
