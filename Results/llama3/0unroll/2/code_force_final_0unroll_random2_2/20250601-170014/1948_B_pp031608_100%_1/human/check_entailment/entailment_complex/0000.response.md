Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly replacing an element with its digits. The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, and whenever it encounters a pair of elements that are in descending order, it checks if the previous element can be replaced with its digits to make the pair sorted. If it cannot, the program sets the answer to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the answer is True and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when the array has only one element. It also correctly handles the case when the previous element is a single digit, in which case it cannot be replaced with its digits.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because it makes a single pass over the array. The space complexity is also O(n), because it creates a new list of digits for each element in the array.

Therefore, the program is correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
