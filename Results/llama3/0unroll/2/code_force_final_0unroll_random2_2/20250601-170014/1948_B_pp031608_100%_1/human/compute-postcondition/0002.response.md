Output State: **The loop has executed n times, and for each test case, it has printed 'YES' if the array can be sorted in ascending order by repeatedly replacing the first element with the smallest digit of the previous element, and 'NO' otherwise. The value of n has been decremented to 1, and the stdin contains no more test cases.**
