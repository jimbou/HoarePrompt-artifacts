This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer array. It then checks if the array can be sorted in ascending order by repeatedly replacing the first element with the smallest digit of the previous element. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the array can be sorted in this way and 'NO' otherwise.
