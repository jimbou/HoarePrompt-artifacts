The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n) — the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1 to. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) — the elements of the array.
