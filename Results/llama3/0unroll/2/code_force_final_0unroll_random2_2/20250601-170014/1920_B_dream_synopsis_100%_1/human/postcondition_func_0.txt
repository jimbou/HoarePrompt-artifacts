This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements (n), the length of the subarray (k), and the number of elements to remove (x). The second line contains n integers representing the array elements. For each test case, the function sorts the array in descending order, calculates the maximum sum of a subarray of length k that can be obtained by removing x elements, and prints this maximum sum. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
