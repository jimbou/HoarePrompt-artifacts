Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, t is a non-negative integer**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input from stdin to `t`. Since the length of the array is a non-negative integer, `t` becomes a non-negative integer. The second line does not affect any variables. The third line does not affect any variables. The fourth line does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
