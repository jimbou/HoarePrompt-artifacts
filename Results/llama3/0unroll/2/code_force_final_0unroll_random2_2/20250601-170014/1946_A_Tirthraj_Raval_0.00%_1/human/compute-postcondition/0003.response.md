Functionality: **Reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (array length) followed by a space-separated list of integers (the array). For each test case, it sorts the array, finds the median element, counts its occurrences, and prints the count. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty.**
