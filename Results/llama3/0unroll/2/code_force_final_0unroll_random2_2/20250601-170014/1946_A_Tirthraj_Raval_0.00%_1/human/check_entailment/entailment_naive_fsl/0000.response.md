Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the median is the smallest number in the array. In this case, the program will return the count of the median, but it should return the number of elements less than the median plus one.

For example, if the input is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the program will return 5, but the correct answer is 1, because we only need to increase one of the elements to make the median greater than the current median.

The correct solution should be to find the number of elements less than or equal to the median and return that number. This is because we need to increase all the elements less than or equal to the median to make the median greater than the current median.
