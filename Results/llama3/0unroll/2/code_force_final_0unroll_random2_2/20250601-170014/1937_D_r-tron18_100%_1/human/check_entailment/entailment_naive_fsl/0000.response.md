Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the input string contains consecutive '<' characters. In this case, the pinball will move to the left and the characters will be inverted, but the program does not correctly calculate the number of steps it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

For example, if the input string is "<<<<", the program will output "1 2 3 4", but the correct output should be "1 3 5 7". The program incorrectly assumes that the pinball will always move to the right when it encounters a '>' character, but in this case, the pinball will move to the left and the characters will be inverted.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
