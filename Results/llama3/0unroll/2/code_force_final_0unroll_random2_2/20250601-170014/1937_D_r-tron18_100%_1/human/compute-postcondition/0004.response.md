Output: **The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: s1 remains the same string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is still a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(s1), pre is an empty list, totalOne is 0, preOne is an empty list, suffZero is a list containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1, and ans is a list of length n containing the calculated values based on the loop iterations, and the elements of ans are being printed**
