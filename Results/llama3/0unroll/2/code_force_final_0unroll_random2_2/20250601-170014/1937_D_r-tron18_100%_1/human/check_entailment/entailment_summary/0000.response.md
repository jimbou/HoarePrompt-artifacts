Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Function 2 (`func_2`) is the main function that calculates the output values. It iterates over the input string `s1` from right to left, maintaining cumulative sums of indices of '<' and '>' characters. It uses these cumulative sums to calculate values for each position in the output list, considering the relative positions of '<' and '>' characters.

The function correctly handles the cases where the pinball moves to the left or right, and it accurately calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. The output values are calculated based on the relative positions of '<' and '>' characters, which is in line with the problem description.

Function 1 (`func_1`) is a helper function that calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element a specified number of positions before it, wrapping around to the end of the list if necessary. This function is used by `func_2` to calculate the output values.

Overall, the program correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query, making it a correct solution to the problem.
