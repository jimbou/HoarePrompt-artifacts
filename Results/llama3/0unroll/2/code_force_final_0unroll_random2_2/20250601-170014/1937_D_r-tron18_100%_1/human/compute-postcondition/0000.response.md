Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(s1), pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros**.

In this final state, the string `s1` and the integer `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `pre` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s1`, starting from 1 (due to the `i + 1` expression in the list comprehension). The variable `totalOne` is set to the length of `pre`, which is the total number of '>' characters in `s1`. The list `preOne` is created by accumulating the indices in `pre`, starting from an initial value of 0. The list `suffZero` is initialized with a single element, 0. Finally, the list `ans` is created with `n` zeros.
