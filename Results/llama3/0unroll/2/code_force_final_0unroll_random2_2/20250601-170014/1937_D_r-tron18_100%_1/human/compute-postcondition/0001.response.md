Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(s1), pre is a list of indices of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n integers where each integer represents the difference between the sum of indices of '<' characters and the sum of indices of '>' characters in the substring s1[i..n-1].
