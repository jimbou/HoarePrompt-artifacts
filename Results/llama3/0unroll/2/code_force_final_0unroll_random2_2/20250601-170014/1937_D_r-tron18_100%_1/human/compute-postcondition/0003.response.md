Based on the precondition, the `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list, which contains the calculated values based on the loop iterations.

The `ans` list is of length `n`, where `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(s1)`. The values in the `ans` list are calculated based on the loop iterations, which involve the `s1` string, the `n` integer, and the `suffZero` list.

Since the exact values of `s1`, `n`, and `suffZero` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the `ans` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(*ans)` statement will output the calculated values of the `ans` list.

Output: **[calculated values of ans list] (where calculated values are based on the loop iterations involving s1, n, and suffZero)**
