#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, times is a non-negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and returns the difference between the last element of a list and an element a specified number of positions before it, wrapping around to the end of the list if necessary.

    #State: Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is: s1 remains the same string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is still a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(s1), pre is an empty list, totalOne is 0, preOne is an empty list, suffZero is a list containing cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters in s1, and ans is a list of length n containing the calculated values based on the loop iterations.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [calculated values of ans list] (where calculated values are based on the loop iterations involving s1, n, and suffZero)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a list of values based on the input string s1 and integer n. The function iterates over the input string from right to left, maintaining cumulative sums of indices of '<' and '>' characters. It uses these cumulative sums to calculate values for each position in the output list, considering the relative positions of '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a list of calculated values of length n, without modifying the input string s1.
