Output State: **The program returns a list of t integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. Each test case is defined by a list of three integers n, x, y, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**
