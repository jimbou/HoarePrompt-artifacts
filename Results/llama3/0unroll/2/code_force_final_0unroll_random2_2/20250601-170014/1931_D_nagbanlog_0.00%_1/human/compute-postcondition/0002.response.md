Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of length `t`, each inner list contains a list of three integers `n`, `x`, `y` and a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, such that 2 <= `n` <= 2*10^5, 1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, and 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.
