    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of length `t`, each inner list contains a list of three integers `n`, `x`, `y` and a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, such that 2 <= `n` <= 2*10^5, 1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, and 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.

    #The program returns a list of t integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case. Each test case is defined by a list of three integers n, x, y, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the required modulo values for x and y, and counting the number of "beautiful pairs" based on these values. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.
