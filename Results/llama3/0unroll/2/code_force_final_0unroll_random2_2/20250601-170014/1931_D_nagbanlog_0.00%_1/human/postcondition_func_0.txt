This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, calculating the required modulo values for x and y, and counting the number of "beautiful pairs" based on these values. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.
