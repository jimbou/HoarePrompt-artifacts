Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array a, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses a frequency map (freq) to store the count of numbers with specific mod_x and mod_y values. For each number in the array, it calculates the required mod_x and mod_y values to form a beautiful pair and checks if such a pair exists in the frequency map. If it does, it increments the beautiful_count.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases where x or y is 1, and where the array contains duplicate numbers. It also correctly handles cases where the required mod_x and mod_y values are the same as the actual mod_x and mod_y values.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
