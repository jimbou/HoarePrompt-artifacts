Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of length `t`, each inner list contains a list of three integers `n`, `x`, `y` and a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, such that 2 <= `n` <= 2*10^5, 1 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, and 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has created a new empty list called `results`, but it has not modified the existing variables `t` and `test_cases`. The properties of `t` and `test_cases` remain the same as in the initial state.
