Output State: **fillvalue is a string, a decorator is defined to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call.**

This output state indicates that the initial state of fillvalue being a string remains unchanged, and a new decorator is defined to handle recursive calls in a repr function, returning the fillvalue in such cases.
