This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and a string of characters (s). It calculates and prints the total number of characters that need to be added to the string s to make the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' at least m, for each test case. The function does not modify the input values and only produces output for each test case.
