Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of problems in the bank (n) is less than the number of upcoming rounds (m). In this case, the program will output a negative number, which is incorrect. The correct output should be the difference between the number of upcoming rounds and the number of problems in the bank.

For example, if the input is:

3
5 10
BGECDCBDED

The program will output -5, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 5, because Vlad needs to come up with 5 more problems to hold 10 rounds.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to add a check to see if the number of problems in the bank is less than the number of upcoming rounds, and if so, output the difference between the two.
