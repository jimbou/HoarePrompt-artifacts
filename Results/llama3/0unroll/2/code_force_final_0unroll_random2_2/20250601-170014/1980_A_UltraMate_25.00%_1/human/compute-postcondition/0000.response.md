Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) followed by a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin now contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` are not yet assigned, as they will be read in subsequent inputs.
