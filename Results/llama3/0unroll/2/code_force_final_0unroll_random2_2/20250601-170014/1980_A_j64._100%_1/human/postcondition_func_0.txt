This function calculates the total number of problems needed to make the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' in a given string at least a specified minimum frequency. It takes as input a string of characters and an integer representing the minimum frequency, and returns the total number of problems needed to meet this requirement. The function assumes that the input string contains only characters from 'A' to 'G' and that the minimum frequency is a positive integer.
