Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible value of the number that Mocha can achieve by performing the given operation on the array. The operation involves choosing a subarray, finding its median, and replacing all elements in the subarray with the median.

The program works by iterating through the array and finding the maximum of the minimum values of adjacent pairs. This is based on the observation that the maximum possible value of the number that Mocha can achieve is the maximum of the minimum values of adjacent pairs in the array.

The program correctly implements this logic and prints the maximum possible value for each test case. It does not modify the input values or return any values, only printing the results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
