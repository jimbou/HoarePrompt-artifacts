Functionality: **Reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it finds the maximum of the minimum values of adjacent pairs in the list and prints this value to the console. The function does not modify the input values or return any values, only printing the results for each test case.**
