The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t`. After reading the first line, the stdin still contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5) and then a list of `n` integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The value of `t` is now known to be between 1 and 500.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5) and then a list of `n` integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**
