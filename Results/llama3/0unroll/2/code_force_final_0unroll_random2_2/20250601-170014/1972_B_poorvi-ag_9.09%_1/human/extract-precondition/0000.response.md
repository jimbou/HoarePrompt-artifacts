Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of coins) and then a string of length equal to the number of coins, containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or facing down. The number of test cases is given in the first line of stdin.**
