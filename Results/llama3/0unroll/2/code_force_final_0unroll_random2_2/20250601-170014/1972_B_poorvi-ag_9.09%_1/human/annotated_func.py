#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of coins) and then a string of length equal to the number of coins, containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or facing down. The number of test cases is given in the first line of stdin.
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The number of test cases t is still an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, stdin is empty.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The number of test cases t is still an integer equal to the number of test cases, results is an empty list, stdin is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (number of coins) and a string of 'U's and 'D's representing coin orientations. It then determines for each test case whether the number of 'U's is greater than the number of 'D's when the number of coins is odd, and prints 'yes' if true, 'no' otherwise. If the number of coins is even, it always prints 'no'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the input stream empty.
