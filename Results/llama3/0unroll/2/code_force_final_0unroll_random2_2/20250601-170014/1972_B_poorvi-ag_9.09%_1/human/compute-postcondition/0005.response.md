Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (number of coins) and a string of 'U's and 'D's representing coin orientations. It then determines for each test case whether the number of 'U's is greater than the number of 'D's when the number of coins is odd, and prints 'yes' if true, 'no' otherwise. If the number of coins is even, it always prints 'no'. The function processes all test cases and prints the results, leaving the input stream empty.**
