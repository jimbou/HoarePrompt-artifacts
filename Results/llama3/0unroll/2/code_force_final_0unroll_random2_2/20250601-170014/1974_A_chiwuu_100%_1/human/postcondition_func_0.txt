This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the second integer into a number greater than or equal to the first integer, and prints the result for each pair. The operations allowed are dividing the number by 2 if it is even, or dividing by 2 and adding 1 if it is odd. The function processes a specified number of pairs, as indicated by the first integer read from standard input.
