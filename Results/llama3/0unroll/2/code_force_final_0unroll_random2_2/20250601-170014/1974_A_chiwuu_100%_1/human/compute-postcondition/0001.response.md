Output State: **The loop will print n lines, each containing a single integer. The integer on each line is the minimum number of operations required to transform the number y into a number that is greater than or equal to x, where each operation is either dividing the number by 2 (if it is even) or dividing the number by 2 and adding 1 (if it is odd).**
