Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of screens needed to place application icons on a desktop. The desktop consists of multiple screens, each represented as a 5x3 grid. There are two types of application icons: 1x1 and 2x2.

The program first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons (a) and 2x2 icons (b).

The program then calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. If the number of 2x2 icons is even, it calculates the number of screens needed as half of the number of 2x2 icons. If the number of 2x2 icons is odd, it calculates the number of screens needed as half of the number of 2x2 icons plus one.

Next, the program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. It subtracts the space occupied by the 2x2 icons (4 cells per icon) from the total space available on the screens (15 cells per screen). If the remaining space is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons, it means that all 1x1 icons can be placed on the existing screens, and the total number of screens needed is the same as the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

If the remaining space is less than the number of 1x1 icons, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. It divides the remaining number of 1x1 icons by 15 (the number of cells per screen) and rounds up to the nearest integer using the ceiling function (// 15 + 1). It then adds this additional number of screens to the total number of screens needed.

Finally, the program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
