Reasoning:

The problem requires determining who will win the game if Alice and Bob play optimally. The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no facing-up coins left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads the input and stores it in a list of cases, where each case is a tuple containing the number of coins and the string representing the coins. `func_2` takes a case as input and returns 'YES' if the number of facing-up coins is odd and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of facing-up coins. Since Bob cannot make a move that leaves Alice with an even number of facing-up coins, Alice will eventually win the game. On the other hand, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves Alice with an even number of facing-up coins, and Alice will eventually lose.

The program correctly implements this logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
