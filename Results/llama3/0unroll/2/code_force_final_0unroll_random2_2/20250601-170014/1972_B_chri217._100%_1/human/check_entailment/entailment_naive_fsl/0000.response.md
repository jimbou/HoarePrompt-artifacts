Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine who will win the game if they both play optimally. The function `func_2` only checks if the number of 'U's is odd or even, but this is not sufficient to determine the winner.

A counterexample is when the input is `n = 4` and `s = "UUDD"`. In this case, the function `func_2` will return 'NO', but Alice can actually win the game by choosing the first 'U' coin, flipping the adjacent 'D' coins, and then choosing the remaining 'U' coin.

The correct solution should consider the arrangement of 'U' and 'D' coins and the optimal moves for both players. The program does not provide a correct implementation of the game logic, and therefore, it is incorrect.
