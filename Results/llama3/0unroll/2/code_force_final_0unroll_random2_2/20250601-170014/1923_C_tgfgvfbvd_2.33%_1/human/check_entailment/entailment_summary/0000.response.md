Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of elements in the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `c` itself, and the query ranges `l_i` and `r_i`.

2. It calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. This is necessary to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

3. For each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray `c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, ..., c_{r_i}` by subtracting the cumulative sum at `a-2` from the cumulative sum at `b-1`. This is correct because the cumulative sum at `a-2` includes all elements before `a`, and subtracting it from the cumulative sum at `b-1` gives the sum of the subarray from `a` to `b`.

4. It checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray (`2 * (b - a + 1)`). This is the condition for a subarray to be "good" according to the problem description.

5. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise, which matches the required output format.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
