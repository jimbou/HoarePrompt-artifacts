Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is "good" based on certain conditions. The program correctly calculates the prefix sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray.

The program then iterates over each query, calculates the sum of the subarray, and checks if it meets the conditions for being "good". The conditions are:

1. The sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray.
2. The length of the subarray is greater than 1.

If both conditions are met, the program prints "YES", indicating that the subarray is "good". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray starts at index 0, by subtracting the prefix sum at index `a-2` from the prefix sum at index `b-1`.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
