stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then a space-separated list of two integers, and then a space-separated list of integers. The first integer represents the number of test cases. The first integer in the list of two integers represents the length of the array c and the second integer represents the number of queries. The list of integers represents the array c. Each query is represented by a space-separated list of two integers, the borders of the subarray.
