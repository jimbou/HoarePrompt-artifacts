Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is good or not. It calculates the prefix sum of the array `c` and then for each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is because each element in the subarray needs to be replaced with a positive integer that is different from the original element, and the sum of the subarray needs to remain the same.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray has only one element (in which case it is not good) or when the subarray starts from the first element of the original array (in which case it does not need to subtract the prefix sum of the previous elements).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
