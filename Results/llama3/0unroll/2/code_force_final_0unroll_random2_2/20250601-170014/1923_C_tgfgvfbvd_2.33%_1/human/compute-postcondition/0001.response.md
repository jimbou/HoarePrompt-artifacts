Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer, a list of two integers, and a list of integers. It calculates the cumulative sum of the list of integers and then answers a series of queries, each represented by two integers (the borders of a subarray). For each query, it checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray and prints 'YES' if true, 'NO' otherwise. The function outputs a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, one per query, with no extra formatting.**
