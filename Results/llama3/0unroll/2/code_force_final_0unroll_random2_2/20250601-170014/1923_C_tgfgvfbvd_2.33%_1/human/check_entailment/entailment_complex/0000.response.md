Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `m`, the array `c` itself, and the queries (each represented by two integers `a` and `b`).

2. The program calculates the cumulative sum of the array `c` and stores it in the list `p`. This is necessary to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.

3. For each query, the program correctly calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a:b]` by subtracting the cumulative sum at index `a-2` from the cumulative sum at index `b-1`. This is because the cumulative sum at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the array.

4. The program then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray. This is the condition for a subarray to be "good" according to the problem description.

5. If the condition is met, the program prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". This is consistent with the problem description, which asks to print "YES" if the subarray is good and "NO" otherwise.

6. The program correctly handles the edge case where `a-2` is less than 0, in which case it simply uses the cumulative sum at index `b-1` as the sum of the subarray.

7. The program also correctly handles the case where the length of the subarray is 1, in which case it prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot be "good" according to the problem description.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
