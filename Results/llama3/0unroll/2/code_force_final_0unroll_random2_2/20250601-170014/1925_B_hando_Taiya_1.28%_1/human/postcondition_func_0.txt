This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, followed by t lines, each containing two integers x and n. It then calculates and prints the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to n for each pair of x and n. The function iterates through all possible divisors of x, checks if the divisor or its corresponding quotient is less than or equal to n, and updates the maximum divisor accordingly. The function prints the maximum divisor for each pair of x and n.
