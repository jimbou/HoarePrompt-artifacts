Output State: **stdin contains 1 input: an integer (t) (1 <= t <= 10^3) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, stdin contains one input: an integer (n) (2 <= n <= 10^4). I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin. R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin.**

The code defines two lambda functions, I and R, which are used to read input from stdin. The I function reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and returns the list. The R function reads a single integer from stdin and returns it. The code does not modify the values of any variables or the state of stdin. The functions I and R are defined but not called, so they do not affect the state of the program.
