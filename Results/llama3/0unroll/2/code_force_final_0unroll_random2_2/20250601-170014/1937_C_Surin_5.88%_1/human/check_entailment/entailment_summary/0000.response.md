Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program first finds the maximum value in the range from 1 to n (inclusive) by comparing each value with the current maximum value. Once the maximum value is found, it then finds its index by comparing each value with the maximum value. Finally, it outputs the result in the required format '! index maximum_value' for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
