Output State: **`w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `w` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `w` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin still contains `w` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`. The values of `n` and `a_i` are still within their respective ranges.
