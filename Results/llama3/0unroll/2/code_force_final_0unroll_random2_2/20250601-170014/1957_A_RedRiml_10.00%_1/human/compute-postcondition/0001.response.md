Output State: **The loop will execute `w` times, where `w` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. In each iteration, it will read a line from stdin containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 100). It will then count the number of unique integers in the input that appear at least three times and print this count. The output will be a sequence of `w` integers, each representing the count of such unique integers in the corresponding test case.**
