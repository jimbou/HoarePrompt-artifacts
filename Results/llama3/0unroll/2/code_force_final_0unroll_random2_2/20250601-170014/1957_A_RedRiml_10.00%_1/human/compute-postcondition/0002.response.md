Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then counts the number of unique integers in each test case that appear at least three times and prints this count for each test case. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases specified by the first integer read from standard input.**
