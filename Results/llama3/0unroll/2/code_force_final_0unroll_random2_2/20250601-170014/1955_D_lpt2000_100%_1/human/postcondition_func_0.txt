This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers (n, m, k) and two lists of integers (a and b). It then calculates the number of pairs of elements that are common to both lists and appear at least k times in the first list, and prints this count for each test case. The function does not modify the input data or retain any information after processing each test case.
