Output State: **The loop will have executed all the iterations, and the variable `fnd` will have been printed to the console for each test case. The values of `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`, and `pairs_in_D` will have been updated and used in the calculations, but their final values will not be retained after the loop finishes. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body will remain unchanged.**
