Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first reads the input and stores it in the `cases` list.
2. It then iterates over each test case in the `cases` list.
3. For each test case, it creates sets of unique elements from the input lists `a` and `b`, and filters out elements that are greater than `k`.
4. It then calculates the number of elements that are only in `a`, only in `b`, and in both `a` and `b`.
5. If the number of elements only in `a` or only in `b` is greater than `k/2`, it immediately returns 'NO' because it is not possible to choose `k/2` elements from both arrays.
6. If the total number of distinct elements (only in `a`, only in `b`, and in both) is less than `k`, it returns 'NO' because it is not possible to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
7. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'YES' because it is possible to choose `k/2` elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to `k` is included.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and returns the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
