Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: two lists of positive integers `a` and `b`, and a positive even integer `k` such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(len(`a`), len(`b`)), `results` is a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the total number of distinct elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
