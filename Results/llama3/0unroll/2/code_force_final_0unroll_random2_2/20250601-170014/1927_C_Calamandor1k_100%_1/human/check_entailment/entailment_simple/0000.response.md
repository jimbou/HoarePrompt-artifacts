Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k/2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.

The program first creates a set of unique elements from each array, and then filters out the elements that are greater than k. It then calculates the number of elements that are only in array a, only in array b, and in both arrays.

The program then checks if the number of elements that are only in array a or only in array b is greater than k/2. If it is, it returns 'NO' because it is not possible to choose k/2 elements from both arrays that include all integers from 1 to k.

If the number of elements that are only in array a or only in array b is not greater than k/2, the program checks if the total number of distinct elements in both arrays that are less than or equal to k is greater than or equal to k. If it is, it returns 'YES' because it is possible to choose k/2 elements from both arrays that include all integers from 1 to k. If it is not, it returns 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and returns the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
