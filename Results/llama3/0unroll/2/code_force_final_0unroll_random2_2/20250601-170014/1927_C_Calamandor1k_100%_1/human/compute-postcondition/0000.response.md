Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a list of three elements: two lists of positive integers `a` and `b`, and a positive even integer `k` such that 2 <= `k` <= 2 * min(len(`a`), len(`b`)), `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The `cases` list also remains unchanged, containing test cases with two lists of positive integers `a` and `b`, and a positive even integer `k` within the specified range. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `results`, which is initialized as an empty list.
