Functionality: **This function takes a list of positive integers 'a', a string 's' of the same length as 'a' containing 'L' and 'R' characters, and two positive integers 'n' and 'm' as input. It rearranges the elements of 'a' into a new list 'b' based on the characters in 's', then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in 'b' in reverse order and returns the result as a list of integers. The function does not modify the input variables 'a', 's', 'n', and 'm'.**
