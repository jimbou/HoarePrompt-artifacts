Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The `func_1` function takes the input parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` and processes them according to the problem statement.
3. The function `func_1` correctly rearranges the elements of `a` into a new list `b` based on the characters in `s`. It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the current positions in `a` from the left and right ends, respectively.
4. The function then calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order. It uses the variable `p` to store the cumulative product and appends each product to the list `ans`.
5. Finally, the function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which represents the remainders of the products of the elements of `a` when divided by `m` at each step.

The execution summary also confirms that the function behaves as expected, taking the input variables `a`, `s`, `n`, and `m` and returning the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
