Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by processing all n commands in the order they are written in the string s. 

The function `func_1` first rearranges the elements of the array `a` into a new list `b` based on the characters in the string `s`. If the character is 'L', it removes the leftmost element from the array `a` and appends it to `b`. If the character is 'R', it removes the rightmost element from the array `a` and appends it to `b`. 

Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and stores the result in the list `ans`. The product is calculated modulo `m` to avoid overflow.

Finally, it returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which contains the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at the beginning of the execution of each command.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 and `m` is 1, and it does not modify the input variables `a`, `s`, `n`, and `m`.

Correctness: **True**
