Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way the product of the remaining elements is calculated. The program calculates the product of all elements in the array `a` and then appends this product to the list `ans` in reverse order. However, the problem description requires the program to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at the beginning of the execution of each command.

To fix this, the program should calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command and append the remainder of this product when divided by `m` to the list `ans`. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            p = (p * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            p = (p * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

This corrected program calculates the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command and appends the remainder of this product when divided by `m` to the list `ans`.
