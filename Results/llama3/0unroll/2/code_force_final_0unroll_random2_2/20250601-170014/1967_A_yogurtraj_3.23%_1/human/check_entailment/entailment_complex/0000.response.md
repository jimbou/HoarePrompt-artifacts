Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of integers `a`.
3. It sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
4. It initializes variables `r` and `rem` to keep track of the maximum value that can be achieved and the remaining coins, respectively.
5. It iterates over the sorted list `a` and checks if it's possible to buy enough cards to make all numbers up to `a[i]` equal. If it's not possible, it calculates the maximum value `r` that can be achieved with the remaining coins and breaks the loop.
6. If the loop completes without breaking, it means that it's possible to make all numbers up to `a[n-1]` equal, and it calculates the maximum value `r` that can be achieved with the remaining coins.
7. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum score that can be achieved.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `k` is zero or when it's not possible to make all numbers up to `a[i]` equal.

Correctness: **True**
