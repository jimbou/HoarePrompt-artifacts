Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

3 4
6 1 8

The program outputs 15, but the correct output should be 22. This is because the program does not correctly calculate the maximum score that can be achieved by rearranging the cards.

The program assumes that the maximum score can be achieved by buying cards of the type that is most abundant, but this is not always the case. In this example, the program buys 4 cards of type 2, but it would be better to buy 2 cards of type 1 and 2 cards of type 3, which would result in a higher score.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and it is incorrect.
