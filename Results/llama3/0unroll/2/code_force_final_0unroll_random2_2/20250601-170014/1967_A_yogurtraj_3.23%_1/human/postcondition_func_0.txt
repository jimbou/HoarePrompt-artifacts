This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n positive integers. The function sorts the integers, calculates a value r based on the sorted list and k, and then prints a result for each test case. The result is determined by the value of r, k, and n, and is calculated differently depending on whether k is zero or non-zero. The function outputs a series of numbers, each representing the result of a test case.
