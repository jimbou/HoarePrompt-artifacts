Output State: **The output state will be a series of numbers, each representing the result of a test case. Each result is calculated based on the input values of n, k, and the list of integers a. The result is determined by the loop's execution, which sorts the list a, calculates the value of r, and then prints the result based on the values of r, k, and n. The output state will contain one result for each test case in the input.**
