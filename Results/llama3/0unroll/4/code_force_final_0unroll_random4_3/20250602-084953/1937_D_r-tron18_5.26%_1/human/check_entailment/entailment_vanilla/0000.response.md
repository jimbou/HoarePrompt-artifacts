Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes an array and a time value as input and returns the difference between the last element of the array and the element at the index `-n` (where `n` is the length of the array) minus the time value. This function is used to calculate the difference between the indices of two elements in the array.

2. `func_2` is the main function that solves the problem. It takes a string `s1` and an integer `n` as input. The string `s1` represents the grid, and `n` is the length of the grid.

3. The function first initializes two lists: `pre` and `suffZero`. `pre` contains the indices of all the '>' characters in the string `s1`, and `suffZero` contains the cumulative sum of the indices of the '<' characters in the string `s1`.

4. The function then initializes an array `ans` of size `n` to store the answers for each query.

5. The function then iterates over the string `s1` from right to left. For each character, it calculates the answer for the query at that index.

6. If the character is '>', the function calculates the answer by considering two cases: when the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, and when the number of '>' characters is greater than the number of '<' characters. In both cases, the function uses the `func_1` function to calculate the difference between the indices of the '>' and '<' characters.

7. If the character is '<', the function calculates the answer by considering two cases: when the number of '<' characters is less than or equal to the number of '>' characters, and when the number of '<' characters is greater than the number of '>' characters. In both cases, the function uses the `func_1` function to calculate the difference between the indices of the '>' and '<' characters.

8. Finally, the function prints the answers for all queries.

Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
