Output State: **s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n zeros.**

In this output state, the initial state of `s1` and `n` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The code creates new variables and assigns them values based on the contents of `s1`. The `pre` list contains the indices (1-indexed) of all '>' characters in `s1`. The `totalOne` variable is set to the length of the `pre` list, which represents the total number of '>' characters in `s1`. The `preOne` list is created by accumulating the indices in the `pre` list, starting from 0. The `suffZero` list is initialized with a single element 0, and the `ans` list is initialized with `n` zeros.
