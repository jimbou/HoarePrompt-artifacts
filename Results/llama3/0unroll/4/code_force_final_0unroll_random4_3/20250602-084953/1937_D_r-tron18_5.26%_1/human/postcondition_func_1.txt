This function takes a string s1 consisting of '<' and '>' characters and its length n as input, and returns a list of n integers. The function calculates the difference between the sum of indices of '<' characters and the sum of indices of '>' characters in s1, considering the indices of '<' characters in reverse order. The function handles two cases: when the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, and when the number of '>' characters is greater than the number of '<' characters. The function returns a list of integers representing the calculated differences.
