Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the rules of the pinball movement and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query. The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the difference between the last element of the input list `arr` and the element at a specific index, which is used in `func_2` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. `func_2` iterates over the input string `s1` from right to left, maintaining a list of indices of '>' characters and a list of cumulative sums of these indices. It also maintains a list of cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters. For each character in `s1`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the number of '>' and '<' characters and their indices. The program handles two cases: when the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, and when the number of '>' characters is greater than the number of '<' characters. The program correctly prints the calculated times for each query.

Correctness: **True**
