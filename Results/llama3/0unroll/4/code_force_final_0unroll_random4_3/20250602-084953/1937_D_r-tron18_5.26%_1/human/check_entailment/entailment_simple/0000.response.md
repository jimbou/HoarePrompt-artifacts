Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave a one-dimensional grid of length n, where each cell contains a character '<' or '>'. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to calculate the answer.

Function func_1 takes a list of integers 'arr' and a non-negative integer 'times' as input and returns the difference between the last element of 'arr' and the element at the index that is the maximum of -n and -1 - times.

Function func_2 takes a string 's1' consisting of characters '<' and '>' and a positive integer 'n' equal to the length of 's1' as input. It first initializes several variables, including 'pre', 'totalOne', 'preOne', 'suffZero', and 'ans'. Then, it iterates over the string 's1' from right to left, updating the variables and calculating the answer for each character.

The program uses the variables 'pre', 'totalOne', 'preOne', and 'suffZero' to keep track of the indices of '>' characters, the total number of '>' characters, the cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters, and the cumulative sums of indices of '<' characters, respectively. The variable 'ans' is used to store the answer for each character.

The program calculates the answer for each character by considering two cases: when the character is '>' and when the character is '<'. In both cases, it uses the variables 'pre', 'totalOne', 'preOne', and 'suffZero' to calculate the answer.

After calculating the answer for all characters, the program prints the answer for each character.

Correctness: **True**
