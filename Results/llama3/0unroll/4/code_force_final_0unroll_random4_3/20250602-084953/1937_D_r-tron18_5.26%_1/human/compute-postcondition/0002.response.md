Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the elements of the list `ans`, which contains `n` integers.

Since `ans` is a list of `n` integers, the print statement will output `n` space-separated integers.

The value of `n` is the length of the string `s1`, which consists of characters '<' and '>'. The exact value of `n` is not provided, but it is a positive integer.

The list `ans` is initialized with `n` integers, but the precondition does not provide information about the specific values of these integers. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the list `ans` likely contains some calculated values related to the string `s1` and its indices.

Therefore, the print statement will output `n` integers, where `n` is the length of the string `s1`. The exact values of these integers are not specified in the precondition.

Output: **n integers (where n is the length of the string s1)**
