This function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of the input list 'arr' and the element at a specific index. The index is determined by taking the maximum of two values: the negative of the list length 'n' and the negative of 1 minus the input 'times'. The function does not modify the input list 'arr' and only uses the input 'times' to determine the index for calculation. The function returns a single integer value representing the calculated difference.
