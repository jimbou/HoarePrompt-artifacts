#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, times is a non-negative integer.
    l = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
    #The program returns the difference between the last element of the list 'arr' and the element at the index that is the maximum of -n and -1 - times. Here, 'n' is the number of elements in the list 'arr', and 'times' is a non-negative integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the difference between the last element of the input list 'arr' and the element at a specific index. The index is determined by taking the maximum of two values: the negative of the list length 'n' and the negative of 1 minus the input 'times'. The function does not modify the input list 'arr' and only uses the input 'times' to determine the index for calculation. The function returns a single integer value representing the calculated difference.

    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer equal to the length of s1, pre is a list of indices (1-indexed) of '>' characters in s1, totalOne is the number of '>' characters in s1, preOne is a list of cumulative sums of indices of '>' characters in s1, suffZero is a list containing a single element 0, ans is a list of n integers.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: n integers (where n is the length of the string s1)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string s1 consisting of '<' and '>' characters and its length n as input, and returns a list of n integers. The function calculates the difference between the sum of indices of '<' characters and the sum of indices of '>' characters in s1, considering the indices of '<' characters in reverse order. The function handles two cases: when the number of '>' characters is less than or equal to the number of '<' characters, and when the number of '>' characters is greater than the number of '<' characters. The function returns a list of integers representing the calculated differences.
