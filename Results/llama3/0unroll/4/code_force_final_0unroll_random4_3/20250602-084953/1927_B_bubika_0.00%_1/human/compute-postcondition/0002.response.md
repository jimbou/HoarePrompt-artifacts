Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It maps each integer in the list to a character in the alphabet (a-z) based on its index, increments the corresponding index in a tracking list, and prints the resulting string. The function repeats this process for all test cases, producing multiple output strings.**
