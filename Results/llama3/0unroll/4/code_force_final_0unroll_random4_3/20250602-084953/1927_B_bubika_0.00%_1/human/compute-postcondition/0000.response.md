Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros**.

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to the variable 'a'. The second line creates a list of 26 zeros and assigns it to the variable 'b'. The initial state of stdin containing multiple test cases is not affected by the code snippet, as it does not read or modify the input. Therefore, the final output state includes the values of 'a' and 'b' as assigned by the code, and the unchanged state of stdin.
