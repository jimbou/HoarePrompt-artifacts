Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Instead of calculating the maximum beauty, it simply sorts the input array in ascending order and prints the sorted array.

The correct approach to solve this problem would be to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This can be done by iterating through the sorted array and adding the difference between each pair of consecutive elements to a running total.

Since the provided program does not correctly solve the problem, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
