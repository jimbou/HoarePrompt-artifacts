Reasoning: 
The given program is not correct. The problem requires the program to calculate the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program only sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, without calculating the beauty.

The correct program should calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The beauty can be calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array, which is equivalent to the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
