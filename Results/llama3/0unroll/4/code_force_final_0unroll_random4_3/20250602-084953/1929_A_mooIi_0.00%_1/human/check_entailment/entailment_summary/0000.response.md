Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program only sorts the array and prints it, without calculating the beauty.

The correct solution would involve calculating the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This can be done by iterating over the sorted array and adding the differences to a running total.

Correctness: **False**
