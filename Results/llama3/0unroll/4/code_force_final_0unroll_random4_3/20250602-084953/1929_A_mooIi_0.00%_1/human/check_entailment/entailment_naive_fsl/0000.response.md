Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem description. The program sorts the array in ascending order and then prints the sorted array, but it does not calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

For example, if the input is:

3
2 1 3

The program will output:

1 2 3

But the correct output should be:

2

Because the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by rearranging the elements to [1, 2, 3], and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements is (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2.

The correct program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not just print the sorted array.
