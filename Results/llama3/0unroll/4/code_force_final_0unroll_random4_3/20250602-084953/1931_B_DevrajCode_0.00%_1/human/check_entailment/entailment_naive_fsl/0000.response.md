Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` takes the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a` as input, calculates the total water and the target amount for each container, and then iterates through the list to check if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

The key insight here is that the program correctly handles the condition that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, which is guaranteed by the problem statement. The program also correctly checks if the container can be filled to the target amount by pouring water from previous containers.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The use of the `container` variable to keep track of the excess water is a clever way to avoid having to iterate through the list multiple times.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
