Reasoning:
The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

2. If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. This difference is added to the `container` variable.

4. If at any point the `container` variable becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount. In this case, the program returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

5. If the program finishes iterating over the containers without returning 'No', it means that it's possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers. In this case, the program returns 'Yes', which is correct.

Correctness: **True**
