The code calculates the target amount of water per container by dividing the total water by the number of containers. It then initializes a variable to keep track of the amount of water in the current container.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, total_water is the sum of the elements in a which is divisible by n, target is the sum of the elements in a divided by n, container is 0**
