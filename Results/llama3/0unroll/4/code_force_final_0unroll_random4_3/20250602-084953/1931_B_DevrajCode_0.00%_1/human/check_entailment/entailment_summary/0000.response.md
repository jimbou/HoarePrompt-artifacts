Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly calculates the total amount of water and checks if it's divisible by the number of containers. If not, it returns 'No' because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly.
2.  It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have and iterates through the list of water amounts.
3.  For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. If this difference is negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target amount, and since we can only pour water from one container to another in one direction (from left to right), it's impossible to distribute the water evenly. In this case, the program returns 'No'.
4.  If the program iterates through all containers without returning 'No', it means that it's possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'Yes'.

Correctness: **True**
