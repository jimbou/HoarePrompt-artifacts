Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases (n) and the amounts of water in each container (a).

2. The function `func_1(n, a)` is defined to solve the problem. It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (n). If not, it returns 'No'.

3. The function then calculates the target amount of water each container should have by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers (n).

4. It initializes a variable `container` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the cumulative difference between the target amount and the actual amount of water in each container.

5. The function then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it adds the difference between the target amount and the actual amount of water to the `container` variable.

6. If the `container` variable becomes negative at any point, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount. In this case, the function returns 'No'.

7. If the function completes the iteration over all containers without returning 'No', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. In this case, the function returns 'Yes'.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
