The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 500). Therefore, `t` is assigned the value of the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases (t-1 test cases remaining)**
