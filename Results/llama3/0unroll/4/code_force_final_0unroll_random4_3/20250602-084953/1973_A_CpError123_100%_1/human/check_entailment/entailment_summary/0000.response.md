Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the total score is odd, in which case it prints -1. This is because the total score must be even, as each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the total score.
2.  The program calculates the minimum of two values: half of the total score (x) and the sum of the scores of the first two players (y). This is correct because the maximum number of draws that could have happened is limited by both the total score and the scores of the first two players.
3.  The program prints the calculated minimum value, which represents the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
