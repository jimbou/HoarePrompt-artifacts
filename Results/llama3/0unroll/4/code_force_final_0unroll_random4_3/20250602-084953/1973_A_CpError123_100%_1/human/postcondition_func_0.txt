This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. For each test case, it calculates the minimum of two values: half of the total score and the sum of the scores of the first two players. If the total score is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum value. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
