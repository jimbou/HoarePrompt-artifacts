Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 1 1 10, the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because it is not possible to achieve the scores 1 1 10 with any valid set of games and results.

In this case, the program is not correctly handling the situation where the total number of points is not evenly distributed among the players. The program is simply calculating the minimum of x and y, where x is the total number of points divided by 2 and y is the sum of the points of the first two players. However, this calculation does not take into account the fact that the points must be evenly distributed among the players.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
