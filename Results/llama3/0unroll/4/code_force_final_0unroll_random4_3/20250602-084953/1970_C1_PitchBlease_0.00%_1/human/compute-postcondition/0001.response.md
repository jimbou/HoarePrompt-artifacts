Output State: **The loop will return the shortest distance from the start node to the target node in the tree, or it will return None if the target node is not reachable from the start node. The queue will be empty, and the visited set will contain all nodes that were reachable from the start node.**

In natural language, the output state is the shortest distance from the start node to the target node in the tree, or None if the target node is not reachable. The queue is empty because all nodes have been processed, and the visited set contains all nodes that were reachable from the start node.
