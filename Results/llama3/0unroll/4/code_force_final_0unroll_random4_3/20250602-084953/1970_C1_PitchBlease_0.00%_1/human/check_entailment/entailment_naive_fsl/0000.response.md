Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input tree has more than two leaves. The problem description states that the tree has exactly two leaves, but the program does not check for this condition. If the tree has more than two leaves, the program will not work correctly.

In the function `func_1`, the program assumes that there are only two leaves in the tree and stores them in the `leaves` list. However, if there are more than two leaves, the `leaves` list will contain more than two elements, and the program will not work correctly.

For example, if the input tree has three leaves, the program will not be able to determine the correct distances from the start node to the leaves, and the output will be incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the tree has exactly two leaves before proceeding with the calculation. If the tree has more than two leaves, the program should raise an error or return an appropriate message.
