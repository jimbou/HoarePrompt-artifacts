#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, edges is a list of pairs of positive integers, start is a positive integer such that 1 <= start <= n. The list of edges represents a tree with n nodes and exactly two leaves.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a dictionary where each key is a node in the graph and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns string 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the winner of a game based on the distance from a start node to the two leaves of a tree graph. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges representing the tree, and a start node. The function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' depending on whether the distance from the start node to either leaf is even.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop will return the shortest distance from the start node to the target node in the tree, or it will return None if the target node is not reachable from the start node. The queue will be empty, and the visited set will contain all nodes that were reachable from the start node.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between two nodes in a tree. It accepts three parameters: the start node, the target node, and a dictionary representing the tree structure. The function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node if it exists, or -1 if the target node is not reachable from the start node.
