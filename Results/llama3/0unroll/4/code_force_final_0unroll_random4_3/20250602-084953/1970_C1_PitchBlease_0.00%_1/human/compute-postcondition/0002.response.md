Output State: **The program returns -1, indicating that the target node is not reachable from the start node.**

In this case, the return statement simply returns the value -1, which is not dependent on any variables or previous calculations. The initial state provides context about the loop's purpose and the expected return values, but the actual return statement overrides this context and returns a fixed value of -1.
