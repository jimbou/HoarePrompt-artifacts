Output State: **start and target are integers representing nodes in the tree, tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, queue is a deque containing a tuple of the start node and 0, visited is a set containing the start node.**

In this output state, the initial state remains unchanged, with start and target still being integers representing nodes in the tree, and tree still being a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. The code introduces two new variables: queue and visited. The queue is a deque (double-ended queue) containing a single tuple, which holds the start node and the value 0. The visited set contains only the start node.
