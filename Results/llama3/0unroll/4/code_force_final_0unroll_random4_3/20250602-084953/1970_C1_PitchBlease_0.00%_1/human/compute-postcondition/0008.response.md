Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on the distance from a start node to the two leaves of a tree graph. It takes as input a positive integer n, a list of edges representing the tree, and a start node. The function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' depending on whether the distance from the start node to either leaf is even.**
