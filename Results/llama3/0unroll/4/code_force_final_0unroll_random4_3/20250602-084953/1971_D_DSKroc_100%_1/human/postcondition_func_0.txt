This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, followed by t strings of 0s and 1s. For each string, it calculates the minimum number of operations (flipping a single character) required to make the string alternate between 0s and 1s. The function then prints the result for each string on a separate line, with the output being the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the alternating pattern.
