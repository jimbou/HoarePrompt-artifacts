#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function determines whether it is possible to perform a series of operations to reduce a given positive integer `n` to 0, given a target positive integer `k`, and prints the result along with the number of operations and the costs of these operations if possible. The function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the reduction is possible. If 'YES', it also prints the number of operations (either 1 or 2) and the costs of these operations. If 'NO', it only prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
