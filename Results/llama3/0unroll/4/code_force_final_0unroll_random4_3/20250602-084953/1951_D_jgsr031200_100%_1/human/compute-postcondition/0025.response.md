Based on the precondition, the initial state of the program is as follows:

*   `n` is 0
*   `k` is a positive integer
*   `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and 1
*   `h` is `n + k`, and `h` is larger than or equal to `k`
*   'YES' is being printed
*   The number 2 is being printed

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print(*costs)
```

The `*` operator in Python is used to unpack the elements of a list. So, `*costs` will unpack the elements of the `costs` list and pass them as separate arguments to the `print` function.

Based on the precondition, the `costs` list contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and 1. Since `n` is 0, `n - k + 1` will be `-k + 1`.

So, the `print` statement will print the values of `-k + 1` and 1.

Output: **-k + 1, 1 (where k is a positive integer)**
