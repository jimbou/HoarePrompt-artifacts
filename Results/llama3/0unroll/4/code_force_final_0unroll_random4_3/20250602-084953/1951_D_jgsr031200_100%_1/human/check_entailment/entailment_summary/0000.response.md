Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. 

The program first checks if n is equal to k, in which case it is possible to set up only one stall with a price of 1. If n is less than k, it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet the condition, so it prints 'NO'. 

If n is greater than k, the program calculates the costs of the stalls. It first calculates the cost of the first stall as n - k + 1, which ensures that Alice will buy at least k jewels from this stall. The cost of the second stall is 1, which ensures that Alice will buy the remaining jewels from this stall. 

The program then checks if the total number of jewels bought from the two stalls is less than k. If it is, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', the number of stalls (2), and the costs of the stalls.

Correctness: **True**
