Functionality: This function determines whether it is possible to make a certain number of moves to reach a target value, and if so, it prints the minimum number of moves required and the costs associated with those moves. The function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. If n is equal to k, the function prints 'YES' and the number 1 twice. If n is less than k, the function prints 'NO'. If n is greater than or equal to k, the function calculates the minimum number of moves required to reach the target value and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. If the minimum number of moves is less than k, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', the number 2, and the costs associated with the moves. The function does not return any value.
