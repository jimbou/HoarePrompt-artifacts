Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 10 and k = 5, the program prints "YES" and the costs as [6, 1]. However, this is incorrect because Alice will buy 1 jewel at the first stall (cost 6) and 1 jewel at the second stall (cost 1), leaving her with 3 coins. She will not be able to buy any more jewels, so she will only buy 2 jewels in total, not 5.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the number of jewels Alice will buy at each stall. It assumes that she will buy as many jewels as possible at each stall, but this is not always the case. The program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the number of jewels Alice will buy at each stall, taking into account the remaining coins she has after each purchase.
