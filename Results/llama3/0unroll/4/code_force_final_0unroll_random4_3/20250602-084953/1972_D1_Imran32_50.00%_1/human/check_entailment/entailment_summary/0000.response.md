Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m;
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

However, the program does not take into account the value of m, which is a crucial part of the problem. The program only calculates the sum of n and the number of multiples of each perfect square less than or equal to n, which is not relevant to the problem.

The program seems to be solving a different problem, possibly related to perfect squares, but it does not address the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
