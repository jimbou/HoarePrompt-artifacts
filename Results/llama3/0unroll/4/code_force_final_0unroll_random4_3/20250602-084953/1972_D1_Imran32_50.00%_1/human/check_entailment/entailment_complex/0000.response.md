Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. It seems to be calculating the sum of n and the number of multiples of each perfect square less than or equal to n, which is not related to the problem statement.

The program does not take into account the value of m, which is a crucial part of the problem. It also does not calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b, which is another important condition in the problem.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem, and its output will not match the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
