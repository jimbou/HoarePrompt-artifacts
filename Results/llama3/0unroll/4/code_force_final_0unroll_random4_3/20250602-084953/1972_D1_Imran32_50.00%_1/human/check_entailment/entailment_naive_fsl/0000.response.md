Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem asks to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m;
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

However, the program does not correctly implement this logic. The function `func_1()` does not take into account the value of `m` and does not calculate the gcd of `a` and `b`. It simply calculates a value based on the square root of `n` and prints it.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges, calculating the gcd of `a` and `b`, and checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. If it is, increment the count of valid pairs.

For example, the program will not work correctly for the input `n = 10, m = 8`, because it does not take into account the value of `m` and does not calculate the gcd of `a` and `b`. The correct output for this input should be `14`, but the program will print a different value.
