Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b)

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1()` is called without being defined. The function definition is provided later in the code, but it should be defined before it is called.

2. The variable `k` is used to store the value of `m`, but it is not used anywhere in the function. Instead, the variable `n` is used, which is supposed to store the value of `n`.

3. The program is trying to calculate the sum of `(n + i) // cnt` for `i` ranging from 2 to the square root of `n`. However, this calculation is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions, not the sum of some values.

4. The program is missing the calculation of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, which is a crucial part of the problem.

5. The program is not iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` to check if they satisfy the conditions.

6. The program is not handling the case where `a` and `b` are equal.

7. The program is not handling the case where `a` and `b` are both 1.

8. The program is not handling the case where `n` or `m` is 1.

Due to these issues, the program is not correctly solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
