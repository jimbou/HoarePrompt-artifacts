The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n` and the number of multiples of each perfect square less than or equal to `n`. The perfect squares are generated by squaring the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1.
Output: **n + (number of multiples of each perfect square less than or equal to n)**
