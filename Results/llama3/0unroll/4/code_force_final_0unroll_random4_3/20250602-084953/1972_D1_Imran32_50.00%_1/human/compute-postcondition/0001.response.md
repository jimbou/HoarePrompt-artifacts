Output State: The value of the variable 'ans' has been updated to include the sum of the quotients of 'n + i' divided by 'cnt' for each iteration of the loop, where 'i' ranges from 2 to the square root of 'n' plus 1, and 'cnt' is the square of 'i'. The values of 'n', 'k', and 'root' remain unchanged.
