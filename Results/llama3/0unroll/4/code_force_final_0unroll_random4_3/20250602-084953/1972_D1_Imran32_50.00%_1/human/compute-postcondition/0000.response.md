Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 2 * 10^6, ans is equal to n, root is an integer equal to the square root of n plus 1**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, which contains two positive integers n and k. The first line assigns the values of n and k to the variables n and k, respectively. The second line assigns the value of n to the variable ans. The third line calculates the square root of n, adds 1 to it, and assigns the result to the variable root. The value of root is an integer because the math.sqrt function returns a floating-point number, which is then converted to an integer using the int function. The value of root is equal to the square root of n plus 1.
