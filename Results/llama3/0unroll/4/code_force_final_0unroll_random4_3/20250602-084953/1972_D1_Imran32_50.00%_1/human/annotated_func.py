#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t, which is a positive integer. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, both of which are less than or equal to 2 * 10^6.
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
        
    #State: Output State: The value of ans is the sum of n and the number of multiples of each perfect square less than or equal to n, where the perfect squares are generated by squaring the numbers from 2 to the square root of n plus 1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: n + (number of multiples of each perfect square less than or equal to n)

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates and prints the sum of a given number `n` and the number of multiples of each perfect square less than or equal to `n`, where the perfect squares are generated by squaring the numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1.
