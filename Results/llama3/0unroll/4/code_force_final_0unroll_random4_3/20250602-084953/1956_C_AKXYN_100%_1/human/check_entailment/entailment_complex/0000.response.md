Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in a matrix by performing a series of operations. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved and prints the required operations to achieve this sum.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing the operations. The sum is calculated as the sum of the products of the row number and the sum of the first `2*i + 1` odd numbers, which is the maximum sum that can be achieved by placing the numbers from 1 to `n` in the matrix.
2.  The program correctly prints the required operations to achieve the maximum sum. The operations are printed in the format specified in the problem statement, with each operation consisting of a type (1 or 2), a row or column number, and a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
3.  The program correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case from standard input, and prints the results in the specified format.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the required output.

Correctness: **True**
