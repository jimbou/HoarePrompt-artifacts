Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix. The strategy is to fill the matrix with the numbers from 1 to n in a way that maximizes the sum. The program does this by filling the first row with the numbers from 1 to n, and then filling the remaining rows with the same numbers, but shifted one position to the right. This ensures that the sum of the numbers in each row is maximized.

The program also correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix. The sum is calculated as the sum of the numbers from 1 to n, multiplied by the number of rows, which is n.

The program also correctly outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is 2n. The operations are output in the correct format, with the type of operation, the row or column number, and the permutation of numbers.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly. The program correctly handles the case where n is 1, where the maximum sum is 1 and the number of operations is 1. The program also correctly handles the case where n is 2, where the maximum sum is 7 and the number of operations is 3. The program also correctly handles larger values of n, where the maximum sum is calculated correctly and the number of operations is 2n.
