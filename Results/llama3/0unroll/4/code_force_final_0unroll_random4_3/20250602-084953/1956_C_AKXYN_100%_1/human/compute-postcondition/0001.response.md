Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates a value 'res' as the sum of the products of the row number and the sum of the first '2*i + 1' odd numbers, and prints this value along with twice the size of the matrix. It then prints a series of lines for each test case, containing two types of statements: '1 i' followed by numbers from 1 to 'n', and '2 i' followed by numbers from 1 to 'n', where 'i' ranges from 'n' to 1 in reverse order. The function does not modify the input values or the size of the matrix.**
