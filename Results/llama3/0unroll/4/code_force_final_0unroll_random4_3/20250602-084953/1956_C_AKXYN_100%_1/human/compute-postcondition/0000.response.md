Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of print statements for each test case. For each test case, the first line contains the value of 'res' (which is the sum of the products of the row number and the sum of the first '2*i + 1' odd numbers) and 'n << 1' (which is twice the size of the matrix). The following lines contain two types of print statements: '1 i' followed by the numbers from 1 to 'n', and '2 i' followed by the numbers from 1 to 'n', where 'i' ranges from 'n' to 1 in reverse order. The number of test cases and the size of the matrix 'n' remain unchanged.**
