Output State: **n is 0, stdin is empty, and the console contains t-1 lines, each containing a single integer, which is the area of the corresponding square.**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable 'n' has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The stdin has been fully consumed, and it is now empty. The console contains the output of the loop, which is the area of each square calculated from the input coordinates. Each area is printed on a new line, resulting in t-1 lines in total.
