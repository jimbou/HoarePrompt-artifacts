Output State: **n is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of a square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The while loop will run `n` times. In each iteration, the second line assigns the integer value of the input to `l`. The third line calculates the value of `s` by adding the integer division of `l` by 4 and the integer division of the remainder of `l` divided by 4 by 2. The fourth line prints the value of `s`. The fifth line decrements `n` by 1. After the loop finishes, `n` will be equal to its original value minus 1. The stdin will contain `t-1` test cases, each containing four lines with two integers.
