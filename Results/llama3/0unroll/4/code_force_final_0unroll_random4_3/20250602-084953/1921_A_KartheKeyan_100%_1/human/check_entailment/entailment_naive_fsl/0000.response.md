Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of increasing x-coordinates. The program assumes that the coordinates are in the order of increasing x-coordinates and calculates the distance between the first two points and the last two points. However, if the coordinates are not in this order, the program will calculate the distance between the wrong points, resulting in an incorrect area.

For example, if the input coordinates are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2), the program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) and between (4, 5) and (4, 2), which are not the correct distances to calculate the area of the square.

To fix this issue, the program should find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and the minimum and maximum y-coordinates, and then calculate the distance between the points with the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and the points with the minimum and maximum y-coordinates. This will ensure that the program works correctly regardless of the order of the input coordinates.
