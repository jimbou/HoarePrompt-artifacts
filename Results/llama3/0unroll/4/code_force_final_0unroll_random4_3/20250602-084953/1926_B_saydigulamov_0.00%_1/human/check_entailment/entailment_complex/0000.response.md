Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires the program to determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a triangle or a square and print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" accordingly. However, the provided program only checks if the number of '1's in the first and second rows of the grid is equal and prints the number of '1's in the first and second rows if they are equal. It does not perform any actions on grids that contain triangles or other shapes, and it does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required.

The program also has a logical error. It checks if the number of '1's in the first and second rows is equal, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square can have any number of rows, not just two.

Correctness: **False**
