Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. Here's why:

1. The program only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's. This is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.

2. The program does not check if the '1's in each row are consecutive or not. This is an important condition for both squares and triangles.

3. The program does not check if the '1's in each row are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid, which is a condition for squares.

4. The program does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle. It only checks for squares and does not have any logic to identify triangles.

5. The program prints the count of '1's in the first two rows if they are equal, but it does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem.

6. The program does not handle the case where the input grid does not contain any '1's.

7. The program does not handle the case where the input grid contains multiple shapes.

8. The program does not handle the case where the input grid contains a shape that is not a square or a triangle.

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
