Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) because it is assigned the value of the first input, which is an integer between 2 and 10. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases because one test case has been read and processed. The rest of the information from the initial state remains the same, as the code only reads the first input and assigns it to `a`, without modifying any other variables or the remaining input.
