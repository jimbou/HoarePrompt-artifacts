Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is supposed to determine whether a given grid contains a square or a triangle and print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" accordingly. However, the program only checks if the number of '1's in the first and second rows are equal and prints the number of '1's in the first and second rows if they are equal. It does not check for the conditions of a triangle or a square, and it does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required.

Correctness: **False**
