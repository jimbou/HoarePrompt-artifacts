Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the shape.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

This input represents a triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check the pattern of '1's in the entire grid, not just the first two rows. It needs to check if the '1's form a square or a triangle according to the problem description.
