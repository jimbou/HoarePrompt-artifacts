Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `t` test cases. Each test case has two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `c_i` are still unknown and will be determined by the remaining input.
