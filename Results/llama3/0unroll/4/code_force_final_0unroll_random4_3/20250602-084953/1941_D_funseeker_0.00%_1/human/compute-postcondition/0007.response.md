Output: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of x after m iterations of the loop. If the current value of ans includes 0, then the postcondition is the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the current value of ans includes n but does not include 0, and the number of possible values of x after m iterations of the loop which is equal to the length of ans is being printed**
