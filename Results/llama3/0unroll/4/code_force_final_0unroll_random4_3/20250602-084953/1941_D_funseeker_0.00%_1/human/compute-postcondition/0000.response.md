Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing the value of x**

The code snippet assigns new values to `n`, `m`, and `x` by calling the function `func_3()`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. The second line creates a set `ans` containing the value of `x`. The value of `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, so the set `ans` contains a single positive integer value.
