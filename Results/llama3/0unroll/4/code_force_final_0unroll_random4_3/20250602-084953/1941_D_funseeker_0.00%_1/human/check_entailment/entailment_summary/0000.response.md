Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem described. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of players, the number of throws, and the initial player. Then, it simulates the throws, updating the possible positions of the ball based on the distance and direction of each throw. The program handles the cases where the direction is unknown ('?') by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise throws. Finally, it prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves.

The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions, which automatically eliminates duplicates. It also handles the case where the position is 0 by replacing it with the total number of players.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
