Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly using the defined functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`).

2. In the main function (`func_4`), it initializes a set `ans` with the starting player number `x`. This set will store the possible player numbers that could have the ball after each throw.

3. The program then iterates over each throw. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c` from the input.

4. It then updates the `ans` set by considering all possible directions for the current throw. If the direction is '0' or '?', it adds the player number obtained by moving `r` steps clockwise from each player in `ans`. If the direction is '1' or '?', it adds the player number obtained by moving `r` steps counterclockwise from each player in `ans`.

5. After updating `ans`, it removes the player number 0 (if present) and adds the player number `n` instead. This is because the player numbers are 1-indexed, and the modulo operation can result in 0.

6. Finally, the program prints the number of possible player numbers that could have the ball after all throws and then prints these player numbers.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It considers all possible directions for each throw and updates the set of possible player numbers accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
