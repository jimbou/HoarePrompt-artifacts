Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described in the problem statement. The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions of the ball after each throw. It iterates over the throws, updating the set of possible positions based on the distance and direction of each throw. If the direction is unknown ('?'), it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise directions.

The program correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown to a position that is equivalent to 0 (i.e., the last player in the circle), by replacing 0 with the total number of players (n) in the set of possible positions.

The program also correctly prints the number of possible positions and the set of possible positions after all throws have been considered.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
