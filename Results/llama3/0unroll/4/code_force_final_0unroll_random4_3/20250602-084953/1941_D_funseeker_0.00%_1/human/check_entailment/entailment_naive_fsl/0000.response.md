Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly simulates the game of throwing a ball among n players, taking into account the distances and directions of the throws. The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions of the ball after each throw, and it correctly handles the cases where the direction of the throw is unknown ('?').

The program also correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown to a position that is equivalent to 0 (i.e., the last player in the circle), by discarding 0 from the set and adding n to it.

The program's output is also correct, as it prints the number of possible positions of the ball after the game, followed by the positions themselves in increasing order.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
