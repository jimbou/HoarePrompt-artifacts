This function takes three parameters: a positive integer n, a non-negative integer m, and a positive integer x such that 1 <= x <= n. It returns the number of possible values of x after m iterations of a loop, where in each iteration, x is updated based on the values of r and c obtained from func_1(). The function also prints the set of all possible values of x after m iterations. If the set includes 0, it is replaced with n. The function ultimately prints the length of the set and the set itself, which includes all positive integers from 1 to n.
