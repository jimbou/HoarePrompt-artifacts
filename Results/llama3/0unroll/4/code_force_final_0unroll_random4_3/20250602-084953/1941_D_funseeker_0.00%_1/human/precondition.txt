stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains three integers n, m, x (2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, 1 <= x <= n). The next m lines contain an integer r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a symbol c_i ('0', '1', or '?').
