Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first x+1 characters of the string s and the rest of the string s are printed. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, then if x is equal to 1 or n divided by 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the substring of s from the start to the index x + 2 and the substring of s from the index x + 2 to the end are printed.***
