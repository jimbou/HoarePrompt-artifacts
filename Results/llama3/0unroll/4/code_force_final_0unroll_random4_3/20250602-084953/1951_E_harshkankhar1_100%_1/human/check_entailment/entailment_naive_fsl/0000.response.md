Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input string is "abba", the program will output "NO", but it should output "YES" with the partition ["ab", "ba"].

The issue is with the function func_2(). It checks if the first character of the string is the same as the first character of the rest of the string, and if not, it tries to partition the string into two parts. However, this approach is not sufficient to cover all possible cases.

For instance, when the input string is "abba", the function will not be able to find a partition because it only checks for a single character mismatch. It does not consider the case where the first two characters are the same, but the rest of the string is not a palindrome.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle more complex cases and consider all possible partitions of the string.
