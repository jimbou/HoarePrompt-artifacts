Functionality: **This function takes a string of lowercase Latin characters as input and performs the following actions:**

*   Checks if the string consists of all the same characters by calling the `func_1` function. If it does, the function prints 'YES', 1, and the input string, and returns without any value.
*   If the string does not consist of all the same characters, it finds the index of the first character that is different from the first character.
*   If no such character is found (i.e., the string consists of all the same characters), the function prints 'NO' and returns without any value.
*   If a different character is found, the function checks if the substring starting from that character consists of all the same characters by calling the `func_1` function.
*   If the substring does not consist of all the same characters, the function prints 'YES', 2, and splits the input string into two substrings: the first substring contains all characters that are the same as the first character of the input string, plus the first character that is different, and the second substring contains all characters that are different from the first character of the input string, starting from the second character that is different.
*   If the substring consists of all the same characters and the index of the different character is not 1 or half the length of the input string, the function prints 'YES', 2, and splits the input string into two substrings: the first substring contains all characters up to the index of the different character plus 2, and the second substring contains all characters from the index of the different character plus 2 to the end.
*   If the substring consists of all the same characters and the index of the different character is 1 or half the length of the input string, the function prints 'NO' and returns without any value.
