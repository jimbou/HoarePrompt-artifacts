Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a string s needs to be partitioned into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions: func_1 to check if a string is a palindrome, and func_2 to find a valid partition of the string s.

The program first checks if the entire string s is not a palindrome using func_1. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 1, and the string s itself, as it is already a valid partition.

If the entire string s is a palindrome, the program then tries to find a valid partition by checking if there is a character in the string that is different from the first character. If such a character is found, it checks if the substring starting from that character is not a palindrome using func_1. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 2, and the partition of the string into two substrings.

If the substring starting from the different character is a palindrome, the program then checks if the index of the different character is 1 or half of the length of the string. If it is, it prints "NO", as there is no valid partition. Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the partition of the string into two substrings, where the first substring includes the first two characters that are different from the first character of the string.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. It correctly identifies when a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and provides a valid partition when possible.

Correctness: **True**
