Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions: `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome, and `func_2` attempts to partition the input string.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. `func_1` is a simple function that checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. This function is correct.

2. `func_2` is the main function that attempts to partition the input string. It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it's not, it simply prints the string as it is and returns.

3. If the entire string is a palindrome, it then checks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If no such character is found, it means all characters in the string are the same, and it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

4. If a different character is found, it then checks if the remaining part of the string (from the different character to the end) is not a palindrome. If it's not, it partitions the string into two parts: the part before the different character (inclusive) and the part after the different character.

5. If the remaining part is a palindrome, it then checks if the different character is at the second position or at the middle of the string. If it is, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

6. If the different character is not at the second position or at the middle of the string, it partitions the string into two parts: the part before the different character (inclusive) and the part after the different character (inclusive).

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. It correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and provides a valid partition if possible.

Correctness: **True**
