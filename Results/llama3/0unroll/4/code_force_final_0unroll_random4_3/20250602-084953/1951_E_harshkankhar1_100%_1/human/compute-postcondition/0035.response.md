Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True, x is not equal to -1, and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True. If x is equal to 1 or n divided by 2, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed, the number 2 is being printed, and the following is being printed: the substring of s from the start to the index x + 2, and the substring of s from the index x + 2 to the end.***
