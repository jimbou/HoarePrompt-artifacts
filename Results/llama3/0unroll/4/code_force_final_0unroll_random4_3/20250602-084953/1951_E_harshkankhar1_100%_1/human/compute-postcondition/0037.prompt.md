You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the string consisting of lowercase Latin characters)
        return
        #The program returns nothing and prints 'YES', 1, and the string s, and the current value of func_1(s[0:]) is False, and x is -1, and n is the length of s, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
    #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is -1, and the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True

    #State: Output State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The value of x remains -1, and the string s still consists of lowercase Latin characters with a length of n. The result of func_1(s[0:]) is still True, and 'NO' is still printed.
    #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: The first substring of s that contains all characters that are the same as the first character of s, plus the first character that is different, followed by a space, followed by the substring of s that contains all characters that are different from the first character of s, starting from the second character that is different.
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :

        #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True, x is not equal to -1, and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True. If x is equal to 1 or n divided by 2, then 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is being printed, the number 2 is being printed, and the following is being printed: the substring of s from the start to the index x + 2, and the substring of s from the index x + 2 to the end.
    #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the first x+1 characters of the string s and the rest of the string s are printed. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, then if x is equal to 1 or n divided by 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the substring of s from the start to the index x + 2 and the substring of s from the index x + 2 to the end are printed.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing and prints 'YES', 1, and the string s, and the current value of func_1(s[0:]) is False, and x is -1, and n is the length of s, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.

Case_2: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The value of x remains -1, and the string s still consists of lowercase Latin characters with a length of n. The result of func_1(s[0:]) is still True, and 'NO' is still printed.

Case_3: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1. The current value of func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and this is printed: the first x+1 characters of the string s, and the rest of the string s

Case_4: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, the result of func_1(s[0:]) is True, x is not equal to -1, and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True. Additionally, x is not equal to 1 and x is not equal to n // 2, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and the following is being printed: the substring of s from the start to the index x + 2, and the substring of s from the index x + 2 to the end, where the index x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
