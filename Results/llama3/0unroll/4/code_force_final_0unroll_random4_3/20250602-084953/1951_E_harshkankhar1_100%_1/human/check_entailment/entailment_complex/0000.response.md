Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether a given string of lowercase Latin characters can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. 

Function 1 correctly checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. 

Function 2 correctly handles the different cases for the input string. If the string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 1, and the string itself. If the string is a palindrome, it checks if all characters are the same. If they are, it prints "NO". If not, it finds the first character that is different from the first character and checks if the rest of the string is a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES", 2, and the partition of the string. If the rest of the string is a palindrome, it checks if the index of the different character is 1 or half the length of the string. If it is, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the partition of the string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
