Based on the precondition, we can analyze the code as follows:

* `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
* `n` is the length of `s`, but it's not used in the print statement.
* `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`. This means that `s[:x]` is a substring of `s` where all characters are the same as the first character of `s`.
* `func_1(s[0:])` is True, but this is not relevant to the print statement.
* `x` is not equal to -1, which means that there is at least one character in `s` that is different from the first character.
* `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False, but this is not relevant to the print statement.
* 'YES' is being printed, but this is not relevant to the print statement.
* The number 2 is being printed, but this is not relevant to the print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])`

This statement prints two substrings of `s` separated by a space:

* `s[:x + 1]`: This is a substring of `s` that starts from the beginning of `s` and ends at index `x + 1`. Since `x` is the index of the first character that is different from the first character, this substring contains all characters that are the same as the first character of `s`, plus the first character that is different.
* `s[x + 1:]`: This is a substring of `s` that starts from index `x + 1` and goes to the end of `s`. This substring contains all characters that are different from the first character of `s`, starting from the second character that is different.

Output: **The first substring of s that contains all characters that are the same as the first character of s, plus the first character that is different, followed by a space, followed by the substring of s that contains all characters that are different from the first character of s, starting from the second character that is different.**
