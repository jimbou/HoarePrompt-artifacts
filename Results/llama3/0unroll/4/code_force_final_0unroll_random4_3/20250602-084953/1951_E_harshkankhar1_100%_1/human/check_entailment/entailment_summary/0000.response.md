Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not. This function is used as a helper function in `func_2`.

`func_2` takes no input and performs the following actions:

1. It reads a string `s` from the input.
2. It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 1, and the string `s` itself.
3. If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If such a character is found, it sets the variable `x` to the index of that character.
4. If `x` is still -1 after the iteration, it means that all characters in the string are the same, and therefore, there is no valid partition. In this case, it prints "NO".
5. If `x` is not -1, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If it's not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
6. If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of the string). If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
7. If `x` is not 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "YES", 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to partition the string into substrings that are not palindromes. The program handles various cases, including when the entire string is not a palindrome, when the entire string is a palindrome but has different characters, and when the entire string is a palindrome with all characters being the same.

Correctness: **True**
