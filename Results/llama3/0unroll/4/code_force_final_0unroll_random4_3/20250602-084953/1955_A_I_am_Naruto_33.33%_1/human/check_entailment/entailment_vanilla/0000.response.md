Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of yogurts, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion as inputs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases using a for loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b) from the input.
3. If the number of yogurts is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - ans1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
   - ans2: The cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion price (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). This calculation takes into account the fact that the promotion price is for two yogurts, so it divides the total number of yogurts by 2 and rounds down (using integer division //). It then adds the cost of any remaining yogurts (n % 2) at the regular price (a).
4. The program prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2, which represents the minimum cost of buying n yogurts.
5. If the number of yogurts is 1, the program simply prints the price for one yogurt (a), as there is no promotion to consider.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. It handles the cases where the number of yogurts is 1, where the promotion price is more advantageous, and where the regular price is more advantageous.

Correctness: **True**
