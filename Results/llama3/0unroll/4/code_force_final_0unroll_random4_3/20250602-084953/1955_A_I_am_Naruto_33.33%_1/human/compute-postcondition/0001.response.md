Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. For each case, it calculates and prints the minimum of two values: the product of n and a, and the product of n and b divided by 2, plus the remainder of the division of n and a by 2. If n is 1, it simply prints the value of a. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results, one per line.**
