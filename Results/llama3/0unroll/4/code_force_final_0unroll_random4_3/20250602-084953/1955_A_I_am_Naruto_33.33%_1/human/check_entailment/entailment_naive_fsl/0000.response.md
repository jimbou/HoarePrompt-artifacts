Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two cases: buying all yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (b * n // 2) and the remaining yogurts at the regular price (a * n % 2). It then prints the minimum of these two amounts.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If n is 1, it simply prints the price of one yogurt (a).
* If n is greater than 1, it calculates the minimum amount by considering the two cases mentioned above.
* The program does not assume any specific values for a and b, so it works correctly for all possible inputs.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
