Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka". 

Here's why:

- The program first reads the number of test cases t from the input.
- For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts n, the price for one yogurt a, and the price for two yogurts on promotion b.
- If n is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs: 
  - ans1: the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
  - ans2: the cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). This is because n // 2 pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price, and the remaining n % 2 yogurts are bought at the regular price.
- It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
- If n is 1, it simply prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (a).

This logic correctly implements the problem description and should produce the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
