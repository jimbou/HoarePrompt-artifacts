Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts based on the given problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers: n (the number of yogurts), a (the price of one yogurt), and b (the price of two yogurts on promotion).

2. For each test case, it calculates two possible costs:
   - ans1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
   - ans2: The cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion. This is calculated as the cost of buying n // 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (b * n // 2) plus the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price (a * n % 2).

3. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.

4. The program handles the special case where n is 1 correctly by simply printing the value of a, as there is no promotion for buying a single yogurt.

5. The execution summary matches the expected behavior of the program, and the example inputs and outputs are consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
