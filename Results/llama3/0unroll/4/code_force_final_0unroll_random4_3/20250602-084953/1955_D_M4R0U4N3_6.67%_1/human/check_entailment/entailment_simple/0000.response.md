Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of subarrays of size m that contain at least k elements from the set todo.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program initializes the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to keep track of the elements in the set `todo` that are yet to be found, the elements that have been found, and the extra elements that are not in `todo`, respectively.
2.  It then iterates over the first `m` elements of the array `a` and updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
3.  The program then enters a loop where it slides the window of size `m` over the array `a`. In each iteration, it removes the leftmost element of the window from the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` and adds the new element to the right of the window to the sets.
4.  If the number of elements in the set `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.
5.  Finally, the program prints the answer `ans` for each test case.

The program's time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `a`, because it makes a single pass over the array. The space complexity is O(m), where m is the size of the window, because it uses sets to store the elements in the window.

Correctness: **True**
