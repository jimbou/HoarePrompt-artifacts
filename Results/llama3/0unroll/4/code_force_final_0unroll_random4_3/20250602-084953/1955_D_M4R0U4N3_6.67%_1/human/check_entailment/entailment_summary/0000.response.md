Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It uses a sliding window approach to count the number of subarrays of size m that contain at least k elements from the set b_1 to b_m. The program maintains three sets: todo (elements from b that are not yet in the current subarray), done (elements from b that are in the current subarray), and extra (elements in the current subarray that are not in b). The program iterates over the array a, updating these sets as it moves the window to the right. It increments the answer whenever the number of elements in the done set is greater than or equal to k.

Correctness: **True**
