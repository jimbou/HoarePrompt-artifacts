Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, and k, the second line contains n integers a_1 to a_n, and the third line contains m integers b_1 to b_m. The function then calculates and prints the number of subarrays of size m that contain at least k elements from the set b_1 to b_m, for each test case.**
