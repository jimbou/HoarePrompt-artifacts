Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the sliding window technique to count the number of subarrays of size m that contain at least k elements from the set todo (which represents the elements of array b).

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program initializes the sets todo, done, and extra correctly. todo contains the elements of array b, done contains the elements of the current window that are also in todo, and extra contains the elements of the current window that are not in todo.

2. The program correctly updates the sets when moving the window to the right. It removes the leftmost element of the window from done and adds it to todo if it was in done, or removes it from extra if it was in extra. It then adds the new element to the right of the window to done if it is in todo, or adds it to extra if it is not in todo.

3. The program correctly checks if the current window contains at least k elements from todo. It does this by checking if the size of done is greater than or equal to k.

4. The program correctly counts the number of subarrays that contain at least k elements from todo. It does this by incrementing the answer variable ans whenever the current window contains at least k elements from todo.

5. The program correctly handles the edge case where the window size is equal to the size of array a. It does this by initializing ans to 1 if the first window contains at least k elements from todo, and then incrementing ans for each subsequent window that contains at least k elements from todo.

Overall, the program correctly implements the sliding window technique to solve the problem, and it handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
