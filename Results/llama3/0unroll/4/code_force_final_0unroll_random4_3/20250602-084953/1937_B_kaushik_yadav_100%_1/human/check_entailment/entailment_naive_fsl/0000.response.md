Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input strings a and b have different lengths. In this case, the program will throw an error when trying to access the elements of the strings at the same index.

For example, if the input is:

3
2
00
000

The program will throw an error when trying to access the element at index 2 of string a, because string a only has 2 elements.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the lengths of the input strings are equal before trying to access their elements. If the lengths are not equal, the program should handle this case accordingly, for example, by padding the shorter string with zeros or by returning an error message.
