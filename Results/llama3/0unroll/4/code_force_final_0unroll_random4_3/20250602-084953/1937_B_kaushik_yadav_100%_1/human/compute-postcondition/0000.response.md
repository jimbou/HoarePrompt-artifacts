Output State: **t is an integer equal to the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4), stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then two binary strings a_11 a_12 ... a_1n and a_21 a_22 ... a_2n (a_1i and a_2i are either 0 or 1)**

The code reads the number of test cases from stdin and assigns it to the variable t. The value of t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The state of stdin is updated to contain multiple test cases, each consisting of three inputs: an integer n (between 2 and 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings a_11 a_12 ... a_1n and a_21 a_22 ... a_2n (where each character is either 0 or 1).
