Output State: **The output state is a series of strings and integers, where each string represents the merged binary string from the two input strings a and b, and each integer represents the maximum number of consecutive positions where a[j + 1] equals b[j]. The number of strings and integers in the output state is equal to the number of test cases t. The state of the variable t remains unchanged.**
