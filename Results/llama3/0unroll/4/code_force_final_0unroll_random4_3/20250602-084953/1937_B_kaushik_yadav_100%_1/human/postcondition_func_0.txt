This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two binary strings a and b. It merges the two binary strings into a single string, prioritizing string a unless a condition is met, and then prints the merged string. Additionally, it calculates and prints the maximum number of consecutive positions where a[j + 1] equals b[j]. The function processes all test cases and outputs the merged strings and maximum consecutive positions for each case.
