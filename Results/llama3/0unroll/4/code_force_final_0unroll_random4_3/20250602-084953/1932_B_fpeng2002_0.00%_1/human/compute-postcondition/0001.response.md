Output State: **num_tests = 0, start_year = ((...(((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] + ... + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1]**



This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all the iterations, the value of `num_tests` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The value of `start_year` will be the result of the calculation performed in the loop, which is a sequence of operations involving the input numbers `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, ..., `nums[n-1]`. The calculation starts with an initial value of `start_year` (which is 0) and iteratively applies the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each input number `nums[x]`. The final result is the value of `start_year` after all iterations have been completed.
