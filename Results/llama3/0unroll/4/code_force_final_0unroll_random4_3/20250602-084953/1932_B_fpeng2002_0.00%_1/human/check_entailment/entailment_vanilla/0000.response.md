Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then enters a loop that runs for each test case.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).

3. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the current sign is expected to occur.

4. The program then enters a loop that iterates over each sign. For each sign, it calculates the year in which the sign is expected to occur by using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula works as follows:
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` calculates the number of times the sign's periodicity has passed since the last sign occurred.
   - `+ 1` increments this count to account for the fact that the sign is expected to occur after the last sign.
   - `* nums[x]` multiplies this count by the sign's periodicity to get the year in which the sign is expected to occur.

5. The program then updates `start_year` with the calculated year and moves on to the next sign.

6. After all signs have been processed, the program prints the final value of `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
