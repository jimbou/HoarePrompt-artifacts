Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `num_tests` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

In this output state, the value of `num_tests` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains the remaining input, which consists of `num_tests` test cases. Each test case has an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where n is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and each a_i is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
