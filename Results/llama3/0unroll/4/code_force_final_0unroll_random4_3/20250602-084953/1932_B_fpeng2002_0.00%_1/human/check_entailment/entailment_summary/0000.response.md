Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the given periodicities of the signs. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers representing the periodicities of the signs.

The program then calculates the start year for each test case by iterating through the periodicities and updating the start year accordingly. The start year is calculated using the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which ensures that the start year is the next multiple of the current periodicity after the previous start year.

The program continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it terminates.

Based on the provided execution summary, the program appears to be working correctly. It reads the input, calculates the start year for each test case, and prints the final start year for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
