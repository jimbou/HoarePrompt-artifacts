Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program iterates over each test case, reads the number of signs and their periodicities, and calculates the year when the nth sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The key part of the program is the calculation of the start year, which is done using the formula:

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

This formula ensures that the start year is the smallest multiple of the current sign's periodicity that is greater than the previous start year. This is because the tribe waits for the current sign to occur after the previous sign has occurred, and the current sign occurs every nums[x] years.

The program correctly handles the case where the start year is 0, which is the initial value before the first sign occurs. It also correctly handles the case where the periodicity of a sign is 1, which means the sign occurs every year.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
