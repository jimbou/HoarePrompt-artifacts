This function takes a list of distinct non-negative integers representing cities in ascending order and returns a list of integers where each element at index i represents the minimum absolute difference between the city at index i and its adjacent cities. If the absolute difference between the city at index i and the next city is less than the absolute difference between the city at index i and the previous city, the element at index i is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the city at index i and the next city.
