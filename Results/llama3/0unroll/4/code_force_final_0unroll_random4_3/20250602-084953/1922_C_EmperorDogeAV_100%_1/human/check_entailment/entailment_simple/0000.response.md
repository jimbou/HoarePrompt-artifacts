Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the cost of traveling from each city to the next city. If the next city is closer than the previous city, the cost is 1, otherwise, the cost is the absolute difference between the two cities.

The program then calculates the prefix sum of the costs in both the forward and backward directions. This allows it to efficiently calculate the total cost of traveling from one city to another by subtracting the prefix sum at the starting city from the prefix sum at the ending city.

The program handles the case where the starting city is greater than the ending city by reversing the list of cities and calculating the prefix sum in the backward direction.

The program also handles the case where the starting city is less than the ending city by calculating the prefix sum in the forward direction.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel from one city to another.

Correctness: **True**
