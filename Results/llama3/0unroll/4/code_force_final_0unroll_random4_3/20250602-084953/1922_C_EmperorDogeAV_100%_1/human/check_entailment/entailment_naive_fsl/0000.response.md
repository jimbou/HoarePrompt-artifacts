Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The `func_1` function correctly determines the closest city for each city and calculates the cost to travel to that city. It handles the edge cases where a city is at the beginning or end of the list.

2. The program correctly calculates the prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` for both forward and backward directions.

3. The program correctly handles the queries by calculating the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b` using the prefix sum arrays.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When `a` is less than `b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.
* When `a` is greater than `b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.
* When `a` and `b` are the same, the cost is 0, which is not explicitly handled but is implicitly correct since the prefix sum arrays are initialized with 0.

The program also handles the edge cases where `a` or `b` is 1 or `n`, where `n` is the number of cities.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and there are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected.
