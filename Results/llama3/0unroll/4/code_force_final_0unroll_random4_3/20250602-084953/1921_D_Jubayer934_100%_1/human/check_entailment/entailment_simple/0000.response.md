Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the greedy algorithm to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the elements of list b to make it as different as possible from list a.

Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of n and m, and then reads the elements of lists a and b.

3. It sorts list a in ascending order and list b in descending order. This is because the maximum total difference D can be obtained by matching the smallest element in a with the largest element in b, the second smallest element in a with the second largest element in b, and so on.

4. It then iterates over the elements of list a and calculates the absolute difference between each element in a and the corresponding element in b. If at any point it finds that the absolute difference between an element in a and the corresponding element in b is less than the absolute difference between the same element in a and the element at the end of b, it breaks the loop and starts appending the absolute differences between the remaining elements in a and the elements at the end of b.

5. Finally, it prints the sum of the absolute differences, which is the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

Correctness: **True**
