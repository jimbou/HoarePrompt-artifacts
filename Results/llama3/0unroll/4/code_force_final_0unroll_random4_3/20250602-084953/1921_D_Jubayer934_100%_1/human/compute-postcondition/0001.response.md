Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lists of integers, a and b. It calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the two lists, either by comparing elements at the same index or by comparing elements at mirrored indices (i.e., the first element of a with the last element of b, the second element of a with the second-to-last element of b, and so on). The function prints the sum of these minimum absolute differences for each test case.**
