Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the elements of array b to make it as different as possible from array a.

The given program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays a and b, and the elements of both arrays. It sorts array a in ascending order and array b in descending order.

The program then iterates over the elements of array a and calculates the absolute difference between each element of a and the corresponding element of b. It stores these differences in the list ans.

However, the program also checks if the absolute difference between the current element of a and the last element of b (which is the largest element in b) is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of a and the corresponding element of b. If this condition is true, it updates the variable temp to the current index i.

If temp is not -1, it means that the program found a case where the absolute difference between an element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the same element of a and the corresponding element of b. In this case, the program updates the list ans by appending the absolute differences between the remaining elements of a and the last elements of b (in reverse order).

Finally, the program prints the sum of the absolute differences in the list ans, which represents the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
