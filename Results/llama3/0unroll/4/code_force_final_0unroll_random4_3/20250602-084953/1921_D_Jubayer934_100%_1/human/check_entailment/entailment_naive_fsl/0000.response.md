Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of array b_i to be as different as possible from array a_i.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first sorts array a_i in ascending order and array b_i in descending order. This is done to ensure that the largest elements in b_i are paired with the smallest elements in a_i, and vice versa, to maximize the difference.

2. The program then iterates over the sorted arrays and calculates the absolute difference between each pair of elements. If the difference between the current element in a_i and the corresponding element in b_i is greater than the difference between the current element in a_i and the last element in b_i, it means that swapping the current element in b_i with the last element in b_i would result in a larger total difference. In this case, the program breaks the loop and appends the differences between the remaining elements in a_i and the corresponding elements in b_i (in reverse order) to the answer list.

3. If the loop completes without finding a case where swapping elements would result in a larger total difference, the program simply appends the differences between the elements in a_i and the corresponding elements in b_i to the answer list.

4. Finally, the program prints the sum of the differences in the answer list, which represents the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the elements in a_i and b_i are identical, and the case where the elements in a_i and b_i are distinct. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
