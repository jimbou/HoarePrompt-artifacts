Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a target element `k` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a binary search algorithm. However, the permutation is not sorted, so the program allows for up to two swaps to be made before running the binary search.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input and returns a map object containing the list of integers. `func_2` converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list. `func_3` is the main function that implements the binary search algorithm.

In `func_3`, the program first finds the index of the target element `k` in the permutation `p`. If `k` is found, the program prints 0. If `k` is not found, the program prints 1, followed by the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `k` and the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `p` (or -1 if `k` is not present).

The program uses a binary search approach to find the position of `k` or the first element greater than `k` in `p`. The binary search is implemented using a while loop that continues until `low + 1 >= high`. In each iteration, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range `[low, high]` and checks if `p[mid]` is greater than `k`. If it is, the program updates `high` to `mid`. Otherwise, the program updates `low` to `mid`.

The program also maintains a set `st` to keep track of the indices that have been visited during the binary search.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
