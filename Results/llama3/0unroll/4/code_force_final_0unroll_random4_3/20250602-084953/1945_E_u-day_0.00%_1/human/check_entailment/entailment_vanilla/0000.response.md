Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search. However, the permutation is not sorted, so the program allows for up to two swaps to be made before running the binary search algorithm.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` reads input from the user and returns a map of integers. `func_2` converts the map returned by `func_1` into a list. `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem.

In `func_3`, the program first reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `k` using `func_1`. It then reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2`. The program finds the position `pos` of the number `k` in the permutation.

The program then initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the permutation, respectively. It also initializes an empty set `st` to keep track of the indices that have been visited.

The program enters a while loop that continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. In each iteration, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` of `low` and `high` and adds it to the set `st`. If the element at index `mid` is greater than `k`, the program sets `high` to `mid`. Otherwise, it sets `low` to `mid`.

After the loop, the program checks if the element at index `low` is equal to `k`. If it is, the program prints 0, indicating that no swaps are needed. Otherwise, the program prints 1, indicating that one swap is needed, and prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the positions of the elements that need to be swapped.

Correctness: **True**
