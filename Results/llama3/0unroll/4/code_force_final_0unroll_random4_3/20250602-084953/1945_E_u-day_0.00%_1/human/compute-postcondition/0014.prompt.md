You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, and the function func_1() returns a tuple of two integers (n, k), and the function func_2() returns a list of integers.
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers, pos is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k exists in arr, otherwise pos is -1.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: low is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k exists in arr, otherwise low is the index of the first element in arr that is greater than k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that were used to find the first occurrence of k or the first element greater than k.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: the index of the second element in arr that is greater than k, or the index of the first element in arr that is greater than or equal to k, 1
    #State: *low is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k exists in arr, otherwise low is the index of the first element in arr that is greater than k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that were used to find the first occurrence of k or the first element greater than k. If the element at index low in arr is equal to k, 0 is printed. Otherwise, arr[low] is not equal to k, 1 is printed, and the values of low + 1 and pos + 1 are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: low is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr, the current value of low is the index of an element in arr that is equal to k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that were used to find the first occurrence of k or the first element greater than k, and the element at index low in arr is equal to k, and 0 is being printed

Case_2: low is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k exists in arr, otherwise low is the index of the first element in arr that is greater than k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that were used to find the first occurrence of k or the first element greater than k, and arr[low] is not equal to k, and 1 is being printed, and the value of low + 1 and pos + 1 are being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
