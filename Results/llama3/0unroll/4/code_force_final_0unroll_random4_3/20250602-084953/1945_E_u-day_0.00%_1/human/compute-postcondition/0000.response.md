Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers, pos is -1**

The code snippet provided consists of four lines. The first line calls the function `func_1()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since `func_1()` returns a tuple of two integers, `n` and `k` will be assigned these values. The second line calls the function `func_2()` and assigns its return value to `arr`. Since `func_2()` returns a list of integers, `arr` will be assigned this list. The third line initializes a variable `pos` to -1. 

After executing the entire code block, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` will be assigned the list of integers returned by `func_2()`. The variable `pos` will be initialized to -1. The initial state's constraints on `n` and `k` being positive integers and `k` being less than or equal to `n` are still valid, as the code does not modify these constraints. The list `arr` is now a list of integers, but its original property of containing distinct integers from 1 to `n` in arbitrary order is no longer guaranteed, as the new list may contain different integers.
