Functionality: **This function determines the position of a target element k in a list arr of distinct integers from 1 to n. It first finds the index of the first occurrence of k in arr, if it exists. If k is found, the function prints 0. If k is not found, the function prints 1, followed by the index of the first element in arr that is greater than k and the index of the first occurrence of k in arr (or -1 if k is not present). The function uses a binary search approach to find the position of k or the first element greater than k in arr.**
