Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the position of a target element k in a list arr of distinct integers from 1 to n. It first finds the index of the first occurrence of k in arr, if it exists. If k is found, the function prints 0. If k is not found, the function prints 1, followed by the index of the first element in arr that is greater than k and the index of the first occurrence of k in arr (or -1 if k is not present). The program uses a binary search approach to find the position of k or the first element greater than k in arr.

Correctness: **True**
