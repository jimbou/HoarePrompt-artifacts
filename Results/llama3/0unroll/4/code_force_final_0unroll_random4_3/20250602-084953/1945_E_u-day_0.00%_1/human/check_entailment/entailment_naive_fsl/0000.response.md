Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

5
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6

The program outputs:

2
2 4
1 5

However, the correct output should be:

1
2 4

The program is not correctly implementing the binary search algorithm after swapping the elements. It is not considering the case when the target element is not at the correct position after the first swap.
