Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of integers, pos is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k exists in arr, otherwise pos is -1, low is 0, high is n - 1, st is an empty set.**

The code initializes two new variables, `low` and `high`, and assigns them the values 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. It also creates an empty set `st`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged.
