Output State: **low is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr if k exists in arr, otherwise low is the index of the first element in arr that is greater than k, high is low + 1, st is a set of indices of elements in arr that were used to find the first occurrence of k or the first element greater than k.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has found the index of the first occurrence of k in the array, or the index of the first element greater than k if k does not exist in the array. The set st contains the indices of the elements that were used to find this index. The variables low and high have been updated to represent the range of the array where the first occurrence of k or the first element greater than k is located.
