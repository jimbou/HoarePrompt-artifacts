Based on the precondition, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `low` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` exists in `arr`, otherwise `low` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, we know that `k` does not exist in `arr` or `low` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`.
* `high` is `low + 1`.
* `st` is a set of indices of elements in `arr` that were used to find the first occurrence of `k` or the first element greater than `k`. However, `st` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for now.
* `pos` is not defined in the precondition, but since `1` is being printed, we can assume that `pos` is equal to `0`.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(low + 1, pos + 1)`

* `low + 1` will print the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, plus one. Since `low` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, `low + 1` will print the index of the second element in `arr` that is greater than `k`, or the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `k`.
* `pos + 1` will print `1`, since `pos` is assumed to be equal to `0`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **the index of the second element in arr that is greater than k, or the index of the first element in arr that is greater than or equal to k, 1**
