Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the input X = 3. According to the problem description, the program should output an array of integers of length at most 200, such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. However, for X = 3, the program outputs:

1
0

This output is incorrect because the array [0] has only 1 increasing subsequence, not 3. 

The program also does not work correctly for other inputs, such as X = 6, X = 7, X = 9, etc. 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the length of the array and the elements of the array to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences. The program uses a greedy approach, but it does not consider all possible cases and does not guarantee the correct output. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
