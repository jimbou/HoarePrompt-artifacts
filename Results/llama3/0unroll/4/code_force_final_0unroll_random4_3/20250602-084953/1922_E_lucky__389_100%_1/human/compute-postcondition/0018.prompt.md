You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). Each integer is a positive integer greater than 1.
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The value of x remains 2, subseq_lens remains an empty list, and mx remains 0. The input from stdin is still a list of integers, and the printed output is still "1" and "0".
    #State: *x is a positive integer, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers, and x is not equal to 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers, mx is the maximum value in subseq_lens, and stdin is empty.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` and then the rest of the integers in `subseq_lens` starting from index 1, and stdin is empty.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: the length of the list ansv (which is equal to the length of subseq_lens plus the number of integers from 0 to mx-1)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is `mx` and the standard output contains the string representation of the list `ansv` with each element separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The value of x remains 2, subseq_lens remains an empty list, and mx remains 0. The input from stdin is still a list of integers, and the printed output is still "1" and "0".

Case_2: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is `mx` and the standard output contains the string representation of the list `ansv` with each element separated by a space.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
