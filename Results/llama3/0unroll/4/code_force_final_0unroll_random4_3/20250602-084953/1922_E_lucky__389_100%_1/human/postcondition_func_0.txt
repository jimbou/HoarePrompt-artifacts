This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to the standard output. It accepts a positive integer x and a list of integers as input. If x is 2, it prints "1" and "0" and returns without modifying the input. Otherwise, it generates a list of integers (subseq_lens) by repeatedly subtracting the largest power of 2 less than or equal to x, and keeps track of the maximum value (mx) in this list. It then constructs a new list (ansv) by concatenating a list of integers from 0 to mx-1 with the rest of the integers in subseq_lens starting from index 1. Finally, it prints the length of ansv and the elements of ansv separated by spaces, followed by an empty line.
