The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x`. So now stdin only contains a list of integers. The second line creates an empty list called `subseq_lens`. The third line assigns 0 to `mx`. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer, subseq_lens is an empty list, mx is 0, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers**
