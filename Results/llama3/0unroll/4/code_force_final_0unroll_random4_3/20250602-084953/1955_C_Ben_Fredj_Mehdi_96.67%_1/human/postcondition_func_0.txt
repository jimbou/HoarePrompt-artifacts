This function takes a series of test cases as input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers. It then performs a series of operations on the list of integers based on the value of k, and outputs the number of zeros in the list after the operations have been performed for each test case. The function handles various special cases and edge conditions, and returns a series of integers representing the number of zeros in the list for each test case.
