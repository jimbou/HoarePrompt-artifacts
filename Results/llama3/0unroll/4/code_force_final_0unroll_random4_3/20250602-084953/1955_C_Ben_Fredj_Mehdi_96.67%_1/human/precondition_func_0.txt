stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and k, and then a list of n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2*10^5, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^15, and the list of integers contains positive integers less than or equal to 10^9.
