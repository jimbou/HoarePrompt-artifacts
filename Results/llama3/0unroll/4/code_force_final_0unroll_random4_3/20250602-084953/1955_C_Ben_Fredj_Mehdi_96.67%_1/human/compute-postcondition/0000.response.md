Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and k, and then a list of n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer less than or equal to 2*10^5, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^15, and the list of integers contains positive integers less than or equal to 10^9.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains test cases, but the number of test cases has been reduced by 1 since we have already read one test case. The remaining test cases still contain two inputs: two space-separated integers n and k, and then a list of n space-separated integers. The constraints on the values of n, k, and the list of integers remain the same.
