This function reads two binary strings 'a' and 'b' from the standard input along with their lengths 'n' and 'm', and returns the length of the longest common subsequence of 'a' and 'b'. The function does not modify the input strings or their lengths. It only calculates and prints the length of the longest common subsequence, leaving the input variables unchanged.
