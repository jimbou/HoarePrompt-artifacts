Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The key to this problem is to understand that Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence is zero.

The given program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by dividing each of the input numbers (a, b, c, d) by 2 and summing the results. This is because each pair of numbers with the same value can be removed by Eve to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero, thus allowing Bob to win.

The program also checks if the sum of the remainders of a, b, and c divided by 2 is 3. If it is, it adds 1 to the total count of Bob's wins. This is because if there are three numbers with the same value (1, 2, or 3) and one number with a different value (4), Eve can remove the three numbers with the same value to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero, thus allowing Bob to win.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, and it handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
