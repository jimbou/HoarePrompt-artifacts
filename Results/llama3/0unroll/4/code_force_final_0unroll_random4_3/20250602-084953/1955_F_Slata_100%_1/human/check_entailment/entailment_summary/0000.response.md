Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice in a game where Eve removes numbers optimally. The game's winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of the numbers in the sequence.

The provided program calculates the sum of the integer divisions of the four input integers by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of the first three integers divided by 2 is 3. This calculation seems to be related to the parity of the numbers in the sequence and the optimal removal strategy for Eve.

However, upon closer inspection, the program's logic appears to be incorrect. The calculation does not accurately reflect the optimal removal strategy for Eve, which would involve removing numbers to minimize the number of times Alice wins.

For example, in the case where the input is (1, 1, 1, 0), the program outputs 1, but the correct output should be 1, because Eve can remove one of the ones, leaving a sequence with a non-zero XOR, and then remove the remaining numbers, resulting in a total of 1 win for Bob.

Therefore, the program's logic is flawed, and it does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
