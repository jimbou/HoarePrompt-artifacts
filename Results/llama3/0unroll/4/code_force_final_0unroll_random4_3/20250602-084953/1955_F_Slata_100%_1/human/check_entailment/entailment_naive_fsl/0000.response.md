Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The key insight is that Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, which happens when the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours is even.

The program uses the fact that the bitwise XOR of a number with itself is zero, so if there are an even number of each digit, Bob can win. The program calculates the number of times Bob can win by counting the number of pairs of each digit (a // 2, b // 2, c // 2, d // 2) and adding 1 if the total number of odd digits is 3 (a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3).

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the input numbers are zero. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
