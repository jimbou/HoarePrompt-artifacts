The function reads a series of lines from standard input, where each line contains four integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of these four integers by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of the first three integers divided by 2 is 3. This calculation is performed for each line of input, and the results are printed to standard output.
