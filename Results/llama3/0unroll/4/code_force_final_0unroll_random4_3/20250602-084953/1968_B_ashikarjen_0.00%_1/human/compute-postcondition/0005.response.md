Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints the number of matching characters between two binary strings a and b. It takes no arguments and returns no value, but rather prints the result directly. The input is expected to be in a specific format, with an integer t followed by t test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, and two binary strings a and b. The function then iterates through string a and string b, counting the number of matching characters and keeping track of the index of the last matched character in string b. Finally, it prints the count of matching characters.**
