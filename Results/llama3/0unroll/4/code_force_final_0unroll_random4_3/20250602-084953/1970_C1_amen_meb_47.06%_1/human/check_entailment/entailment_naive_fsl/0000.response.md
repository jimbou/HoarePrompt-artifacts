Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly because it does not actually build the tree or perform the game logic as described in the problem description. The function `func_1()` only reads the input edges and stores them in a list, but it does not construct the tree or perform any game-related operations.

The main part of the program only compares the number of edges in the input and prints "Ron" or "Hermione" based on a simple comparison, which is not related to the actual game logic.

For example, if the input is:

```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```

The program will print "Ron", but it does not actually perform the game logic to determine who wins. The correct output should be determined by analyzing the tree structure and the game moves, not just by comparing the number of edges.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
