Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The function `func_1()` is supposed to read the input and return the necessary information to determine the winner of the game. However, the function only reads the first two integers of each line and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains two consecutive integers. This is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

The program then tries to determine the winner by comparing the number of sublists where `num_1 > num_2` and `num_1 < num_2`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not take into account the actual structure of the tree or the starting node of the stone.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to read the entire input, construct the tree, and then determine the winner based on the starting node and the structure of the tree.

Correctness: **False**
