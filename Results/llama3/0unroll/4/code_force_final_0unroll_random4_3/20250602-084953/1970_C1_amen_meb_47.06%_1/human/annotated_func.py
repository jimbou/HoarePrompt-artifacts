#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t (n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2*10^5 and t is 1), then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= n), and finally one integer u_1 (1 <= u_1 <= n).
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: numbers = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10]]
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains two consecutive integers, starting from 1 and 2, and ending at 9 and 10.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, expecting pairs of integers until a single integer is encountered, and returns a list of these integer pairs. The function does not perform any validation or processing on the input data, simply storing and returning the pairs as they are read.
