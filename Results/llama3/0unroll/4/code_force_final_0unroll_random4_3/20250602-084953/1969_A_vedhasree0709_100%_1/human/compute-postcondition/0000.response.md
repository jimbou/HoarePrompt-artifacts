Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the result of each test case. The result will be either 2 or 3, depending on whether a pair of integers in the input list satisfies the condition q == i + 1. If such a pair is found, the result will be 2; otherwise, the result will be 3. The number of integers in the output list will be equal to the number of test cases, which is given by the integer t in the initial state.**
