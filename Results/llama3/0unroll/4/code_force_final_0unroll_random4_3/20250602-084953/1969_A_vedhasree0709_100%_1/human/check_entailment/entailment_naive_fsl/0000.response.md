Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 3 because Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3, and friends 1 and 2 will attend.

However, if the input is:

6
2 3 4 5 6 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4 because Monocarp needs to send invitations to friends 1, 2, 3, and 4, and friends 1 and 2 will attend.

The program only checks for the case where two friends are each other's best friends, but it does not consider the case where more than two friends are involved in a cycle of best friendships. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
