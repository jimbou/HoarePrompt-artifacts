Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of distinct integers. It checks each list for a specific condition: whether there exists a pair of integers where the value of the second integer is equal to the index of the first integer plus one. If such a pair is found, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.**
