Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the favorite cube has the same value as the cube at index k, but there are other cubes with the same value that are not removed. In this case, the program will print "YES" or "NO" depending on whether the favorite cube is at index k or not, but the correct answer should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

For example, consider the input:

5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

In this case, the favorite cube has value 3, which is the same as the cube at index k. However, there are two other cubes with value 3 that are not removed. The program will print "YES" because the favorite cube is at index k, but the correct answer should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube may or may not be removed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
