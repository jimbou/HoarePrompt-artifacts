Reasoning: 
The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It first reads the input values for the number of cubes (n), the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (f), and the number of removed cubes (k). It then reads the values shown on the cubes (a) and sorts them in non-increasing order. The program checks if the value of the k-th cube is greater than, less than, or equal to the value of Dmitry's favorite cube (x). If the k-th cube's value is greater than x, it prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite cube will not be removed. If the k-th cube's value is less than x, it prints 'YES', indicating that the favorite cube will be removed. If the k-th cube's value is equal to x, it checks if k is equal to n - 1 (i.e., the last cube) or if the next cube's value is less than x. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Correctness: **True**
