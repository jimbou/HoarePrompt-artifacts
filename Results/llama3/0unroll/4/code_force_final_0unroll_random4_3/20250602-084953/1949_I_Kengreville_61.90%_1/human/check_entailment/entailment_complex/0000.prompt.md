Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: n is an integer equal to the input value, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n True values, coef0 is a list of n integers, coef1 is a list of n integers, nodes is an empty list, and ok is True if at least one c1 is not equal to 0, False otherwise.
    if ok :

If at least one c1 is not equal to 0, ok is True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, ok is False and 'NO' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given set of points on a 2D plane can be divided into two groups such that the sum of the x-coordinates of the points in one group is not equal to the sum of the x-coordinates of the points in the other group. It takes as input the number of points and their coordinates, and outputs 'YES' if such a division is possible and 'NO' otherwise.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a positive integer, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, nodes is a list of integers, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.

        #State: The loop has iterated over all nodes in the graph, and for each unvisited node j that is within the sum of the radii of the current node i and node j, the coefficients coef0 and coef1 have been updated, and a depth-first search (dfs) has been performed on node j. The visited list has been updated to reflect the nodes that have been visited during the loop. The values of x, y, r, nodes, coef0, and coef1 remain unchanged for nodes that were not visited during the loop.
    #State: The loop has iterated over all nodes in the graph. For each node i, if it was not visited before, then for each unvisited node j that is within the sum of the radii of the current node i and node j, the coefficients coef0 and coef1 have been updated, and a depth-first search (dfs) has been performed on node j. The visited list has been updated to reflect the nodes that have been visited during the loop. The values of x, y, r, nodes, coef0, and coef1 remain unchanged for nodes that were not visited during the loop. If node i was already visited before, then no updates have been made.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph, updating coefficients and marking visited nodes. It takes an integer index `i` and modifies the `visited` list, `nodes` list, `coef0` list, and `coef1` list. The function iterates over all nodes in the graph, and for each unvisited node `j` within the sum of the radii of the current node `i` and node `j`, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` and recursively performs a DFS on node `j`. The function leaves the values of `x`, `y`, `r`, and `nodes` unchanged for nodes that were not visited during the loop.
