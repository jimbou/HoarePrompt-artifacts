Functionality: **This function determines whether a given set of points on a 2D plane can be divided into two groups such that the sum of the x-coordinates of the points in one group is not equal to the sum of the x-coordinates of the points in the other group. It takes as input the number of points and their coordinates, and outputs 'YES' if such a division is possible and 'NO' otherwise.**
