Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, n is a positive integer, visited is a list of boolean values of length n where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers where i is appended to the end, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n.**

The code modifies the `visited` list by setting the value at index `i` to `True`, indicating that the node at index `i` has been visited. Additionally, the code appends the value of `i` to the end of the `nodes` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
