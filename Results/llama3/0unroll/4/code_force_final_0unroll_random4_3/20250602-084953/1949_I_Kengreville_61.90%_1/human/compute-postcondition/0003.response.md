Postcondition: **The loop has iterated over all nodes in the graph. For each node i, if it was not visited before, then for each unvisited node j that is within the sum of the radii of the current node i and node j, the coefficients coef0 and coef1 have been updated, and a depth-first search (dfs) has been performed on node j. The visited list has been updated to reflect the nodes that have been visited during the loop. The values of x, y, r, nodes, coef0, and coef1 remain unchanged for nodes that were not visited during the loop. If node i was already visited before, then no updates have been made.**
