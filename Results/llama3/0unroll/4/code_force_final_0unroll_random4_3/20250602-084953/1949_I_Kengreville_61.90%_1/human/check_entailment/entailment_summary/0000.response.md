Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to change the radii of a set of disks in a 2D plane such that disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent, no two disks overlap in a region of positive area, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`. The `func_1` function reads the input, initializes variables, and performs a loop over all disks. For each disk, it checks if the disk has not been visited before and if so, it calls the `dfs` function to perform a depth-first search on the graph of disks.

The `dfs` function updates coefficients and marks visited nodes. It takes an integer index `i` and modifies the `visited` list, `nodes` list, `coef0` list, and `coef1` list. The function iterates over all nodes in the graph, and for each unvisited node `j` within the sum of the radii of the current node `i` and node `j`, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` and recursively performs a DFS on node `j`.

The program uses the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to keep track of the sum of the radii of the disks in each group. The `coef0` list stores the sum of the radii of the disks in the first group, and the `coef1` list stores the sum of the radii of the disks in the second group. The program checks if the sum of the radii of the disks in one group is not equal to the sum of the radii of the disks in the other group, and if so, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Based on the execution summaries, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The `func_1` function correctly reads the input, initializes variables, and performs a loop over all disks. The `dfs` function correctly updates coefficients and marks visited nodes. The program correctly uses the coefficients to keep track of the sum of the radii of the disks in each group and prints the correct output based on the problem constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
