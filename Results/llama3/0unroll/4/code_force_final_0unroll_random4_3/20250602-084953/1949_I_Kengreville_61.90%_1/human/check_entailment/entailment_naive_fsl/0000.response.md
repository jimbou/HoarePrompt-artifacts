Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other, no two disks overlap in a region of positive area, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases. However, the program does not correctly check for these conditions.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when there are three disks that are mutually tangent to each other. In this case, the program will incorrectly determine that it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner, when in fact it is not.

For example, consider the input:

3
0 0 1
1 0 1
0 1 1

In this case, the program will output "YES", but it is not possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The program incorrectly assumes that it is possible to decrease the radii of the first and third disks by 0.5 and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5, but this would result in the disks overlapping in a region of positive area.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
