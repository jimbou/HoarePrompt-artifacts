Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer between 0 and n - x, a is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, present is a set of x distinct integers from 0 to n - 1, ans is an integer equal to x - 2.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the state of the program is as follows: The standard input (stdin) now contains t-1 test cases, as one test case has been processed. The variables n, x, and y retain their original values, which are integers within the specified ranges. The list 'a' now contains x distinct integers from 0 to n-1, sorted in ascending order. These integers were originally from 1 to n, but were decremented by 1. The set 'present' contains the same x distinct integers as list 'a', but in a set data structure. Finally, the variable 'ans' is initialized to x-2, which is an integer.
