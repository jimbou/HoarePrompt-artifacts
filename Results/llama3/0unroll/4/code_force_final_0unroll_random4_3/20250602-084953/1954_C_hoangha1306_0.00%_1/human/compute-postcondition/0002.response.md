Output State: The output state will contain 2t lines, each containing an integer. The integers are the results of the comparisons and concatenations performed in the loop. The first t lines will contain the smaller of the two input integers at each position where they differ, and the second t lines will contain the larger of the two input integers at each position where they differ. The remaining positions will contain the same digit from both input integers.
