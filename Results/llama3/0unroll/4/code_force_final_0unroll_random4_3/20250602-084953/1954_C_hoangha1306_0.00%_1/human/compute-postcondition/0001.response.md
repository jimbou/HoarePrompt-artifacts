Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the standard output contains 2t lines, each containing a string of digits from 1 to 9. The length of each string is equal to the length of the input strings x and y. The strings are constructed by comparing the corresponding digits of x and y from left to right. If the digits are the same, the digit is appended to both strings. If the digits are different, the smaller digit is appended to the first string and the larger digit is appended to the second string, unless the first string has already been assigned a larger digit, in which case the larger digit is appended to the first string and the smaller digit is appended to the second string.
