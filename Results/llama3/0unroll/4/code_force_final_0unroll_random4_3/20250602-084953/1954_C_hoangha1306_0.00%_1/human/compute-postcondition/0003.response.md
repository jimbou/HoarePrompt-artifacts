Functionality: **This function compares two input integers of equal length, digit by digit, and generates two output integers. The first output integer contains the smaller digit at each position where the input integers differ, and the same digit where they are the same. The second output integer contains the larger digit at each position where the input integers differ, and the same digit where they are the same. The function repeats this process for a specified number of test cases, each with two input integers.**
