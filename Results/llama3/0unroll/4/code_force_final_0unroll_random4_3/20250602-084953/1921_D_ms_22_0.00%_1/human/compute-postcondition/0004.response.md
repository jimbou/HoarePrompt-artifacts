Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates and prints the minimum sum of absolute differences between each a_i and the closest b_i, considering the constraints that the closest b_i for each a_i can be either the smallest or largest b_i. The function iterates through all test cases, updating the values of variables accordingly, and finally prints the minimum sum of absolute differences for each test case.**
