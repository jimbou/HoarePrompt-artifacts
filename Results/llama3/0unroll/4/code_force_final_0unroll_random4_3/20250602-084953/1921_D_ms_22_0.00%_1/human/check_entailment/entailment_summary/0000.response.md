Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses a max heap to keep track of the maximum differences between each element in array a and the smallest or largest element in array b. The program iterates through each element in array a, calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in array b, and pushes the maximum difference into the max heap. Then, it pops the maximum difference from the heap, updates the answer, and moves the pointers tp1 and tp2 accordingly. This process continues until all elements in array a have been processed.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log m) due to the heap operations, where n is the number of elements in array a and m is the number of elements in array b. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the max heap.

The program correctly implements the greedy strategy to maximize the total difference D. By always choosing the maximum difference between each element in array a and the smallest or largest element in array b, the program ensures that the total difference D is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
