Output State: **The program has finished executing all test cases and has printed the minimum sum of absolute differences for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` have been updated accordingly after each iteration.**

In this output state, the program has completed all the iterations of the loop and has processed all the test cases. For each test case, it has calculated and printed the minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b`. The values of the variables within the loop have been updated after each iteration to reflect the changes made during the execution of the loop. The program has now finished its execution, and the output state reflects the final values of the variables after all iterations have been completed.
