Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

The program uses a max heap to keep track of the differences between the elements of a_i and the elements of b_i. It starts by pushing the differences between each element of a_i and the smallest and largest elements of b_i into the max heap. Then, it pops the largest difference from the heap and updates the total difference D accordingly. It also updates the pointers tp1 and tp2 to keep track of the current smallest and largest elements of b_i that have not been used yet.

The program correctly handles the case where the differences between the elements of a_i and the elements of b_i are equal, and it also correctly handles the case where the elements of b_i are not distinct.

The program's time complexity is O(n log m), where n is the length of a_i and m is the length of b_i. This is because it uses a max heap to keep track of the differences, and the heap operations take O(log m) time.

The program's space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of a_i. This is because it uses a max heap to keep track of the differences, and the heap size is at most n.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
