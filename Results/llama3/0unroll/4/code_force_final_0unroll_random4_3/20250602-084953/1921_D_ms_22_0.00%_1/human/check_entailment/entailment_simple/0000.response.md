Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of n and m, followed by the arrays a_i and b_i. It sorts the array b_i in ascending order.

The program then creates a max heap to store the differences between each element in a_i and the smallest and largest elements in b_i. The heap is used to keep track of the maximum differences that can be obtained.

The program then iterates through the heap, popping the maximum difference from the heap and updating the total difference D. If the popped difference is not valid (i.e., the corresponding element in b_i has already been used), the program calculates the differences between the current element in a_i and the smallest and largest remaining elements in b_i and updates the total difference D accordingly.

Finally, the program prints the maximum total difference D that can be obtained for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
