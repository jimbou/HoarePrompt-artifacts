The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with three lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `m`. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, `t` is equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **The program is being run as the main module, `t` is equal to the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**
