Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the minimum and maximum possible values of k (bx and ax) and a set to store the values that k cannot be equal to (cx). Then, it iterates over the constraints, updating bx, ax, and cx accordingly.

After processing all constraints, it checks if bx is greater than ax, which means there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints, and appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the number of possible values of k by subtracting the number of values in cx that are within the range [bx, ax] from the total number of values in the range [bx, ax] (ax - bx + 1).

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Constraints of type 1 (k >= x) and type 2 (k <= x) that define the range of possible values for k.
* Constraints of type 3 (k != x) that exclude specific values from the range.
* Cases where there are no possible values of k that satisfy all constraints (bx > ax).
* Cases where there are multiple constraints of the same type.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
