The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print the elements of the list `r` separated by newline characters.

Based on the initial state, `r` is a list containing the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx` for each test case. This means that each element in `r` represents the count of integers in a specific range that are not present in another set `cx`.

Since the exact values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of integers in each range that are not present in `cx`, separated by newline characters.

Output: **The count of integers in each range [bx, ax] that are not in cx, separated by newline characters**
