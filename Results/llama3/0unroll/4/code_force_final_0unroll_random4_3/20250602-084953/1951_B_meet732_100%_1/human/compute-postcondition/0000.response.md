Output State: **a is a list containing two integers n and k, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i, x is the kth element of the list a, ind is an empty list, c is 0.**

The code assigns the kth element of the list `a` to `x`, creates an empty list `ind`, and initializes `c` to 0. The values of `a`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
