#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, find is an integer from 1 to n.
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: l is the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to find, r is the index of the smallest element in the array that is greater than find, array, find, and n remain unchanged.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the second string is the index of 'find' in the array plus one.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: l is the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to find, r is the index of the smallest element in the array that is greater than find, array, find, and n remain unchanged. l is equal to the index of find in the array, and 0 is printed

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of a target element 'find'. If 'find' is present in the array, it returns a list containing two strings: the index of the largest element less than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the index of 'find' in the array plus one. If 'find' is not present in the array, it prints 0 and does not return any value. The function does not modify the input array or any other variables.
