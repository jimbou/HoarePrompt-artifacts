Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It performs a binary search on the input array to find the index of the target element 'find'. If 'find' is present in the array, it returns a list containing two strings: the index of the largest element less than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the index of 'find' in the array plus one. If 'find' is not present in the array, it prints 0 and does not return any value.

The program correctly implements the binary search algorithm and handles the case where 'find' is not present in the array. The use of the index method to find the index of 'find' in the array is also correct.

However, it's worth noting that the program does not actually perform the swaps as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply prints the indices that would need to be swapped. This is likely due to the fact that the problem statement asks for the number of operations performed, which in this case is always 1 or 0.

Correctness: **True**
