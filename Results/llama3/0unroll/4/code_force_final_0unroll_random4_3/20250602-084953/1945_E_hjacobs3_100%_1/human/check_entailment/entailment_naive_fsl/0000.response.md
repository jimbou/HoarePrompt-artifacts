Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x. However, the program only checks if l is equal to the index of the find element in the array, and if not, it swaps the elements at positions l and the index of the find element. This does not guarantee that p_l will be equal to x after the algorithm is executed.

For example, consider the input:

6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6

The program will output:

0

However, if we run the binary search algorithm on the original array, we will get l = 2, but p_l = 3, not x = 3. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the find element is not in the array. In this case, the program will raise an IndexError when trying to access array.index(find).
