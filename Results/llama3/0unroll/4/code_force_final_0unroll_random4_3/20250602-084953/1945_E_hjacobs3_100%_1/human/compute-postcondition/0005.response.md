Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the second string is the index of 'find' in the array plus one.**

Note: The value of 'find' is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is implied that it exists in the array. The index of 'find' in the array is returned as a string, incremented by one.
