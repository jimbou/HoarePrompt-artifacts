Output State: **l is the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to find, r is the index of the smallest element in the array that is greater than find, array, find, and n remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the loop has successfully found the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to the target value `find`. The variable `l` now holds this index, and the variable `r` holds the index of the smallest element in the array that is greater than `find`. The array, the target value `find`, and the number of elements `n` remain unchanged.
