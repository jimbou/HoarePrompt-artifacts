This function performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of a target element 'find'. If 'find' is present in the array, it returns a list containing two strings: the index of the largest element less than or equal to 'find' plus one, and the index of 'find' in the array plus one. If 'find' is not present in the array, it prints 0 and does not return any value. The function does not modify the input array or any other variables.
