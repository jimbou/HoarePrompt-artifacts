Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
2.  In each iteration of the loop, the program reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to be found `x`. It then reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.
3.  The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the permutation `array` and the number to be found `find` as input. This function implements the binary search algorithm.
4.  Inside `func_1`, the program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the permutation, respectively. It then enters a loop that continues until `r - l` is greater than 1.
5.  In each iteration of the loop, the program calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range `[l, r)` and checks if the element at index `mid` is less than or equal to `find`. If it is, the program updates `l` to `mid`; otherwise, it updates `r` to `mid`.
6.  After the loop ends, the program checks if the index `l` points to the correct element `find` in the permutation. If it does not, the program prints 1, indicating that one swap operation is needed, and returns a list containing the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` as strings. These indices represent the positions that need to be swapped to make the binary search work correctly.
7.  If `l` already points to the correct element `find`, the program prints 0, indicating that no swap operations are needed, and returns an empty list.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
