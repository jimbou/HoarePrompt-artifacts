Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b. The program uses a while loop to iterate through both strings a and b, and it uses a helper function func_1 to find the index of the next occurrence of the current character in string a within the remaining substring of string b.

The program correctly initializes variables i and j to 0, which are used to keep track of the current position in strings a and b, respectively. It also initializes variable c to 0, which is used to count the number of characters in the prefix of string a that are found in string b.

Inside the while loop, the program calls the func_1 function to find the index of the next occurrence of the current character in string a within the remaining substring of string b. If the character is found, the program updates the values of j and i, and increments the count c. If the character is not found, the program breaks out of the loop.

The func_1 function correctly uses the find method to search for the substring a[i:] within the substring b[j:]. If the substring is found, the function returns the index of the first occurrence; otherwise, it returns -1.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of string a of length k is a subsequence of string b.

Correctness: **True**
