Output State: **The program returns the sum of `j` and `index`, where `j` is a non-negative integer less than the length of binary string `b`, and `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i:]` in `b[j:]`.**

In this output state, the returned value is the sum of two non-negative integers, `j` and `index`. The value of `j` is less than the length of binary string `b`, and the value of `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i:]` in `b[j:]`. Since `index` is not -1, it indicates that `a[i:]` is found in `b[j:]`.
