Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is always empty ('.'). a is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, s is 0**

The code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `a`, which is now equal to the value of the first test case. The variable `s` is initialized to 0. The rest of the test cases remain in stdin, unchanged.
