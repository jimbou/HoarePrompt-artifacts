Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are well-defined in the problem description.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board (`r` and `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`).
3.  The program then checks if Alice's chip is initially above Bob's chip (`a > c`). If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot win in this scenario.
4.  If Alice's chip is not above Bob's chip, the program calculates the number of rows (`x`) that Alice needs to move to reach Bob's row. It uses the formula `x = abs(a - c) // 2` to calculate this.
5.  The program then checks if the difference between Alice's and Bob's rows is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`). If it is, Alice can potentially win by moving diagonally. The program calculates the left and right boundaries (`l` and `r`) of the column range that Bob's chip can occupy to block Alice's winning move.
6.  If the difference between Alice's and Bob's rows is even, Bob can potentially win by moving diagonally. The program calculates the left and right boundaries (`l` and `r`) of the column range that Alice's chip can occupy to block Bob's winning move.
7.  In both cases, the program checks if the opponent's chip is within the calculated column range. If it is, the program prints the winner's name ("Alice" or "Bob"). Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

Based on this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the game's logic and rules. It handles all possible scenarios and edge cases, and its calculations are accurate.

Correctness: **True**
