Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. The issue lies in the way it calculates the possible moves for Alice and Bob.

For example, consider the case where the board has dimensions 10x10, Alice's chip is at position (1, 6), and Bob's chip is at position (10, 8). According to the program, Alice will win because `abs(a - c) % 2` is 1, and `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are both True.

However, this is incorrect. Alice's possible moves are (2, 5), (2, 6), and (2, 7), while Bob's possible moves are (9, 7), (9, 8), and (9, 9). Alice cannot win in this case because Bob's chip is not in any of the cells that Alice can move to.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly calculate the possible moves for Alice and Bob. It only considers the horizontal distance between the chips, but not the vertical distance. This leads to incorrect results in cases where the vertical distance is significant.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the possible moves for both Alice and Bob, taking into account both the horizontal and vertical distances between the chips.
