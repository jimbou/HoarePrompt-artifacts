Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers, 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w. x_a is not equal to x_b or y_a is not equal to y_b.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, because one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain six integers each, with the same constraints as before.
