Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a list of strings, where each string is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The number of strings in the list will be equal to the number of test cases (t). Each string will be the result of the game for the corresponding test case, based on the rules defined in the loop body. The values of the variables t, h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b will remain unchanged.**
