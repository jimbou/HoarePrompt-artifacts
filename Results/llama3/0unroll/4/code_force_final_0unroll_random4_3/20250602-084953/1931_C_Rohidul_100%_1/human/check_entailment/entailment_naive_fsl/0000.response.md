Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3], the program will output 4, but the correct answer is 3. The program only checks for the longest sequence of equal elements at the beginning and end of the array, but it does not consider the case where the longest sequence is in the middle of the array.

The program assumes that the longest sequence of equal elements is either at the beginning or at the end of the array, but this is not always the case. The program needs to be modified to find the longest sequence of equal elements in the entire array, not just at the beginning and end.

For example, the program can be modified to use a sliding window approach to find the longest sequence of equal elements in the array. This will ensure that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
