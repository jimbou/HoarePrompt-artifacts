This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer representing the length of a list and the list itself containing positive integers. It calculates and prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from each list to make it a list with alternating elements. If the first and last elements of the list are the same, it considers removing elements from both the start and end of the list to achieve the alternating pattern. The function outputs a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the minimum number of removals required for each input list.
