Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list contains positive integers. The number of test cases is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of the lengths of the lists for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
