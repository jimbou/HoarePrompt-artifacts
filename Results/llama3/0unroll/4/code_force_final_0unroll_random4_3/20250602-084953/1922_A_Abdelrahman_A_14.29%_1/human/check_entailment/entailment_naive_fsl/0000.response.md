Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not.

The program checks if c is equal to a or b, and if not, it checks if any character in c is not present in a or b. However, this is not sufficient to determine if a template t exists that matches a and b but not c.

A counterexample is when a = "abc", b = "abc", and c = "abd". In this case, the program will print "NO" because it only checks if c is equal to a or b, or if any character in c is not present in a or b. However, a template t = "ABC" would match a and b but not c, so the correct output should be "YES".

The program needs to be modified to correctly implement the logic to determine if a template t exists that matches a and b but not c.
