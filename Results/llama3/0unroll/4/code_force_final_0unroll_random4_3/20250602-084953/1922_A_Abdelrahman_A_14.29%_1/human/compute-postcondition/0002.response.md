Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three strings a, b, and c. It then checks if string c contains any character not present in strings a or b. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' to the console; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results, leaving the input variable 'tests' unchanged.**
