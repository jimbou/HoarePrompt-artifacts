Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, one for each test case. If string c contains any character not present in strings a or b, 'YES' will be printed for that test case. Otherwise, 'NO' will be printed. The value of the variable 'tests' remains unchanged.**
