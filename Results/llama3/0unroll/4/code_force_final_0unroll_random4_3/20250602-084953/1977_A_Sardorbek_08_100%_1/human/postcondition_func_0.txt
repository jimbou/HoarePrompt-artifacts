This function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines each containing two integers n and m. It then prints 'YES' if n equals m, 'NO' if n is less than m, 'Yes' if n and m have the same parity, and 'No' otherwise, for each line. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input values.
