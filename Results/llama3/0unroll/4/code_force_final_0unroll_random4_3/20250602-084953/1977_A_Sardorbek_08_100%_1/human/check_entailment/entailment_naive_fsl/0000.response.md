Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it is possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program checks three conditions:

1. If b (the number of moves) is equal to c (the number of cubes), it prints 'YES' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower b times in a row.

2. If b is less than c, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

3. If b is greater than c, it checks if b and c have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If they do, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can build a tower with c cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower b times, and then removing the excess cubes. If they do not have the same parity, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot build a tower with c cubes.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.
