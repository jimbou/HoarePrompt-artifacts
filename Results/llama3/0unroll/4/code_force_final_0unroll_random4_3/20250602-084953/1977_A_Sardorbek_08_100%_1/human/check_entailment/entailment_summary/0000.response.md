Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in each move, and the goal is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly m cubes after n moves.

The program correctly handles the following cases:

1. If n equals m, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply add one cube at a time to reach m cubes.
2. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.
3. If n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to reach m cubes.
4. If n and m have different parity, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot add or remove cubes in pairs to reach m cubes.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
