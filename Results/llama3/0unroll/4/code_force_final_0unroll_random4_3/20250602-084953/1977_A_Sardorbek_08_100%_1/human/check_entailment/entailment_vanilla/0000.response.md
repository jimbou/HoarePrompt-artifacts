Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking the following conditions:

1. If the number of moves (b) is equal to the number of cubes (c), it prints 'YES'.
2. If the number of moves (b) is less than the number of cubes (c), it prints 'NO'.
3. If the number of moves (b) and the number of cubes (c) have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes'.
4. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there are some issues with the program's logic:

* In the first condition, it only checks if b is equal to c, but it doesn't consider the case where b is greater than c. In this case, it's still possible to end up with c cubes if Nikita adds c cubes and then removes b-c cubes.
* In the second condition, it correctly prints 'NO' if b is less than c, because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
* In the third condition, it checks if b and c have the same parity, but this is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to end up with c cubes. For example, if b is 5 and c is 3, they have the same parity, but it's not possible to end up with 3 cubes after 5 moves.

Considering these issues, the program's logic is not correct, and it will produce incorrect results for some inputs.

Correctness: **False**
