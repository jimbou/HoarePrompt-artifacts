The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `a`. In the initial state, the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).

Since the code only reads the first integer from the standard input, the value of `a` will be equal to `t`. The remaining input, which consists of `t` lines with two integers each, will still be in the standard input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `a` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).**
