Reasoning:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

* If b (n) equals c (m), it's possible to have a tower with m cubes by simply adding m cubes (since n equals m).
* If b (n) is less than c (m), it's not possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than he has moves.
* If b (n) and c (m) have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it's possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can add or remove cubes in pairs to reach the desired height.
* If b (n) and c (m) have different parity, it's not possible to have a tower with m cubes because Nikita can't change the parity of the tower by adding or removing cubes.

The program correctly implements this logic using simple conditional statements.

Correctness: **True**
