The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` first, followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n` (1 <= `n` <= 26), `k` (1 <= `k` <= 26), and `m` (1 <= `m` <= 1000). The second line contains a string `s` of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n` (1 <= `n` <= 26), `k` (1 <= `k` <= 26), and `m` (1 <= `m` <= 1000). The second line contains a string `s` of length `m`, comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
