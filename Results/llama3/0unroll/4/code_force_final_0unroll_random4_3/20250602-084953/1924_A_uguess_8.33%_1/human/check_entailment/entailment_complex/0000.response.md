Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values of n, k, and m, and the string s for each test case.
2.  It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of times a subsequence of length k containing all k lowercase English alphabets appears in the string s.
3.  It uses a bitmask `cur` to keep track of the characters that have been seen so far in the current subsequence. The bitmask is initialized to 0, and for each character in the string s, it checks if the character has been seen before by performing a bitwise AND operation with the corresponding bit in the bitmask. If the character has not been seen before, it sets the corresponding bit in the bitmask.
4.  If the bitmask becomes equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, it means that all k lowercase English alphabets have been seen in the current subsequence, so it increments the counter `cnt` and resets the bitmask to 0.
5.  After processing the entire string s, it checks if the counter `cnt` is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s.
6.  If `cnt` is less than n, it prints 'NO' and constructs the lexicographically smallest string of length n that contains all k lowercase English alphabets and is consistent with the given string s. It does this by first appending `cnt` copies of the last character of the alphabet that appears in the string s, then appending the remaining characters needed to form a string of length n.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
