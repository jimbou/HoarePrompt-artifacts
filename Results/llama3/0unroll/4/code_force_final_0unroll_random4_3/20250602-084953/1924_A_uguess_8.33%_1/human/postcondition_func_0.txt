This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, k, m) and a string s. It checks if the string s contains at least n substrings of length k that contain all k lowercase English alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' followed by the lexicographically smallest string of length n that contains all k lowercase English alphabets and is consistent with the given string s. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input.
