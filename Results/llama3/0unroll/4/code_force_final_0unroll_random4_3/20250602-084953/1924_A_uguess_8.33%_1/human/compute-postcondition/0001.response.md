Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' followed by a string. The 'YES' or 'NO' indicates whether the string s contains at least n substrings of length k that contain all k lowercase English alphabets. If 'NO', the string is the lexicographically smallest string of length n that contains all k lowercase English alphabets and is consistent with the given string s.**
