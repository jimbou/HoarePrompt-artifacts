Postcondition: **A is a positive integer, g is a dictionary representing a tree where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, k is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, stack is an empty list, visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree, d is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is the number of its descendants, r is the number of nodes with at least A descendants. The loop has finished executing all its iterations. The stack is empty, indicating that all nodes in the tree have been visited. The visited set contains all nodes in the tree, confirming that each node has been visited at least once. The dictionary d now contains the number of descendants for each node in the tree. The variable r has been incremented for each node with at least A descendants. Additionally, either r is less than or equal to k and d[1] is less than A, or r is not equal to k.**
