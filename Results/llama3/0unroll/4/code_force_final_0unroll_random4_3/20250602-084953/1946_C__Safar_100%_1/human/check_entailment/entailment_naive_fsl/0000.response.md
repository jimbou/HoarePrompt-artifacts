Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the binary search algorithm to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The `func_1` function initializes the graph and calls the `check` function to perform the binary search. The `check` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph and count the number of connected components with size at least A. If the number of such components is greater than k or if the size of the root component is at least A and the number of such components is equal to k, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The binary search is performed by iterating over the possible values of x from 1 to n/k and checking if it is possible to remove exactly k edges to get connected components of size at least x. If it is possible, the function updates the lower bound of the search range. If it is not possible, the function updates the upper bound of the search range.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where k is 1 and the case where k is equal to the number of edges in the tree. It also correctly handles the case where the tree has only one vertex.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
