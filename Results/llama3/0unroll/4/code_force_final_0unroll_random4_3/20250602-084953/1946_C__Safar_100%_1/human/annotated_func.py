#Overall this is what the function does:This function constructs an undirected graph from a list of edges and then performs a binary search to find the largest value for which a certain condition (defined by the check function) returns False. The function prints this largest value. The input variables n, k, and edges are not modified by the function.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a tree, represented by a dictionary of nodes and their neighboring nodes, can be modified by removing a specified number of edges (k) such that the number of nodes with at least A descendants meets certain conditions. It returns True if the number of nodes with at least A descendants is greater than k or if the number of descendants of the root node (node 1) is greater than or equal to A and the number of nodes with at least A descendants equals k. Otherwise, it returns False.
