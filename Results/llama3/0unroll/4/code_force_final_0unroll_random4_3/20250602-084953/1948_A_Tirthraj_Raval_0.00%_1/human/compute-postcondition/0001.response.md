Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a sequence of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', followed by a pattern of 'A's and 'B's if the corresponding input number is even. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' strings and the number of patterns is equal to the initial value of `t`. The value of `t` is unchanged.
