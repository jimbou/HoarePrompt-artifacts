The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a sequence of integers (the number of special characters for each test case). The first input is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is the integer that was input, which is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50. The stdin now contains one input: a sequence of integers (the number of special characters for each test case).

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50, stdin contains one input: a sequence of integers (the number of special characters for each test case).**
