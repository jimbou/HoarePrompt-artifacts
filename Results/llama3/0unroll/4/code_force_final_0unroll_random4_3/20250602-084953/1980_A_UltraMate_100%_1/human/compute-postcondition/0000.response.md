The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two integers n and m, and then a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. The first input is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t-1 test cases. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two integers n and m, and then a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. 1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5.
