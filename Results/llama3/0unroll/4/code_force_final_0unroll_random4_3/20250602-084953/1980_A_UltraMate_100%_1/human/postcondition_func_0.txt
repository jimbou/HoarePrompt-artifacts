This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and a string of characters (a). It calculates and prints the total number of characters that need to be added to the string to make all characters appear at least m times. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results, one integer per test case, representing the total number of characters to be added.
