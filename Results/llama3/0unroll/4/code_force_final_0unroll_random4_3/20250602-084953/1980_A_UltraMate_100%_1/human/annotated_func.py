#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first two integers n and m, and then a string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'. 1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the total number of characters that need to be added to the string `s` to make all characters appear at least `m` times. The number of integers in the output state is equal to the initial value of `t`, and each integer is the result of the calculation inside the loop for each test case. The value of `t` is reduced by 1, and the stdin is empty after the loop finishes executing.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m) and a string of characters (a). It calculates and prints the total number of characters that need to be added to the string to make all characters appear at least m times. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results, one integer per test case, representing the total number of characters to be added.
