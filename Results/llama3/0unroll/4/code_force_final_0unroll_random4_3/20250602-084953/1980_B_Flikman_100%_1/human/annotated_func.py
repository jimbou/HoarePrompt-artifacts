#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, f, and k (1 <= f, k <= n <= 100). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 100).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        removed_count = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
                removed_count += 1
        
        favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
        
        if removed_count == favorite_count:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` iterations, each processing a test case from the input. The output will be a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' strings, one for each test case, indicating whether the favorite value is removed, not removed, or partially removed, respectively. The value of `t` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The input stream will be exhausted, having been fully consumed by the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a set of integers and a favorite value. It then determines whether the favorite value is removed, not removed, or partially removed after removing the k largest values, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' accordingly for each test case.
