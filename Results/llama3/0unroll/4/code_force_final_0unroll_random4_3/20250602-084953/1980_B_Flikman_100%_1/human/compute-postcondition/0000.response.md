Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
	* The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines.**

In this output state, `t` has a specific value between 1 and 1000, and the stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each with two lines. The values of other variables are not affected.
