Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a set of integers and a favorite value. It then determines whether the favorite value is removed, not removed, or partially removed after removing the k largest values, and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' accordingly for each test case.**
