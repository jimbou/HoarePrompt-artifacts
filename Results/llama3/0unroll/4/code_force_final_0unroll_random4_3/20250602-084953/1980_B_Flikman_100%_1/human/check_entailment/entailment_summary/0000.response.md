Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or partially removed after removing the k largest values.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values, including the number of test cases, the number of cubes, the index of the favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes.
2.  It correctly identifies the favorite cube's value and sorts the cubes in non-increasing order.
3.  The program then iterates through the sorted cubes and counts how many times the favorite cube's value appears among the removed cubes (i.e., the first k cubes).
4.  It also counts the total number of occurrences of the favorite cube's value in the sorted list.
5.  Based on these counts, the program correctly determines whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or partially removed and prints the corresponding output ('YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE').

Correctness: **True**
