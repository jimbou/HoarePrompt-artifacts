Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` iterations, each processing a test case from the input. The output will be a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' strings, one for each test case, indicating whether the favorite value is removed, not removed, or partially removed, respectively. The value of `t` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The input stream will be exhausted, having been fully consumed by the loop.**
