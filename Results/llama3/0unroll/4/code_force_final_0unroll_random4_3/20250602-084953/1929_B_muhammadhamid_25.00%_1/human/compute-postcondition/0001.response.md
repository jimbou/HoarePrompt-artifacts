Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a square grid size (n) and a minimum number of diagonals (k) that should have at least one colored cell. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to satisfy the condition for each test case. The output is a series of integers, one for each test case, representing the minimum number of cells to be colored.**
