The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n. For each test case, it calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n, prints the sum along with the value of n + n, and then prints two sets of numbers from 1 to n, each preceded by the numbers 1 and 2, respectively. The function consumes all input from standard input and produces output to the console, without modifying any external state or returning any value.
