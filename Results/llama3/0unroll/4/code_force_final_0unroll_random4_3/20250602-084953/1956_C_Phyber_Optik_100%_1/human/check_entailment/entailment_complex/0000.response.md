Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer n. For each test case, it calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n, prints the sum along with the value of n + n, and then prints two sets of numbers from 1 to n, each preceded by the numbers 1 and 2, respectively.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix, which is the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n. It also correctly prints the number of operations, which is 2n.

The program's output format is also correct. It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations on the first line, followed by the description of each operation on subsequent lines. Each operation is described by the type of operation (1 or 2), the row or column index, and the permutation used in the operation.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
