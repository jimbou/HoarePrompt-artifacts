Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row or column of the matrix.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix (n).

3. It calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved by performing the operations. The formula used for this calculation is `sum = 1 + (2^2 - 1^2) * 2 + (3^2 - 2^2) * 3 + ... + (n^2 - (n-1)^2) * n`. This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum can be achieved by placing the largest numbers in the matrix in a way that maximizes their contribution to the sum.

4. It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve this sum, which is 2n.

5. It then prints the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. For each row and column of the matrix, it prints an operation of type 1 (assigning a permutation to a row) and an operation of type 2 (assigning a permutation to a column). The permutation used in each operation is the sequence of numbers from 1 to n.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum that can be achieved and prints the operations required to achieve this sum.

Correctness: **True**
