Output State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) multiplied by their respective indices, followed by the number `n + n`. Additionally, it has printed two sets of numbers for each iteration: the first set contains the numbers 1 to `n` (inclusive) in ascending order, and the second set contains the numbers 1 to `n` (inclusive) in descending order. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the input from stdin has been consumed.
