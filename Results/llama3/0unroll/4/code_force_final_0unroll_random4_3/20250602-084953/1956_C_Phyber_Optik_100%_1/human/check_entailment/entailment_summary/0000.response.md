Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix by using the formula for the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to n. It then prints the sum along with the value of n + n, which represents the number of operations required to achieve this sum. The program also prints the operations required to achieve this sum, which involves printing two sets of numbers from 1 to n, each preceded by the numbers 1 and 2, respectively. This is in accordance with the problem description, which requires the program to output the maximum sum and the operations required to achieve it.

Correctness: **True**
