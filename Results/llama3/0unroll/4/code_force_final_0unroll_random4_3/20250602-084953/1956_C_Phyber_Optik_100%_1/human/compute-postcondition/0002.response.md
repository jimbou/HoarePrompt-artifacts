Output State: **The loop has executed t times, and for each execution, it has printed the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to n, the value of n + n, and two sets of numbers from 1 to n, each preceded by the numbers 1 and 2, respectively. The value of t remains unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The input from stdin has been consumed, and the output has been printed to the console.**
