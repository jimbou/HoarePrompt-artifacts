Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix. The program uses a formula to calculate the sum, but this formula is not correct for all cases.

For example, when n = 3, the program calculates the sum as 1 + (3*3 - 2*2) * 3 = 1 + 5 * 3 = 16. However, the correct maximum sum for a 3x3 matrix is 21, which can be achieved by setting the matrix to [[3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 2], [1, 2, 3]].

The program also does not correctly generate the operations to achieve the maximum sum. The program simply prints out a sequence of operations that set each row and column to the numbers 1 to n, but this does not necessarily result in the maximum sum.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the maximum sum and generate the operations to achieve it. One possible approach is to use a brute force method to try all possible permutations of the numbers 1 to n and calculate the sum for each permutation. The permutation that results in the maximum sum can then be used to generate the operations.
