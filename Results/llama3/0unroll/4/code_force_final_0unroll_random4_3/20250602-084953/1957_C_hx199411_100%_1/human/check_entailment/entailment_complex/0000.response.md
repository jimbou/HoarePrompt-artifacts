Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. 

The program first calculates the number of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks, which is stored in the variable 'num'. Then, it calculates the number of remaining rows and columns that are not occupied, which is stored in the variable 'm'. 

If 'm' is 0 or 1, there is only one possible configuration, so the program prints 1. If 'm' is greater than 1, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The dynamic programming array 'dp' is used to store the number of possible configurations for each value of 'm' from 1 to 'm'. 

The base cases for the dynamic programming are 'dp[1] = 1' and 'dp[2] = 3', which represent the number of possible configurations when 'm' is 1 and 2, respectively. 

For 'm' greater than 2, the program calculates 'dp[i]' as the sum of 'dp[i - 1]' and '(i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2', which represents the number of possible configurations when the current row is occupied by a rook and when it is not occupied, respectively. 

Finally, the program prints 'dp[m]' as the result, which is the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

Correctness: **True**
