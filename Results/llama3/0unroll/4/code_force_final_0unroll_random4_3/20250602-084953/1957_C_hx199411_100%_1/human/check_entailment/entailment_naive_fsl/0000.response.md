Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. It first calculates the number of rows and columns that are blocked by the already played moves, and then uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining rows and columns.

The dynamic programming approach is correct because it considers all possible ways to place the remaining rooks. The base cases are correct, and the recursive formula is also correct. The program correctly handles the case where there is only one row or column left, and it correctly handles the case where there are multiple rows and columns left.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of remaining rows and columns is odd, and it correctly handles the case where the number of remaining rows and columns is even. The program correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for all possible cases, and it correctly prints the result modulo 10^9+7.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it correctly solves the problem.
