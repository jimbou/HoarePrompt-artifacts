Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k, followed by k lines each containing two integers r_i and c_i. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, and r_i and c_i are non-negative integers less than n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been read and processed. The remaining test cases still contain two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines each containing two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, with the same constraints as before.
