Output State: **t = 0, n = 0, k = 0, num = 0, m = 0, dp = [0], c = 0, r = 0, i = 0**.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the variables in the loop head and body have been reset to their initial values. The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, `dp`, `c`, `r`, and `i` have all been reset to their initial values, indicating that the loop has finished executing and all the computations have been completed.
