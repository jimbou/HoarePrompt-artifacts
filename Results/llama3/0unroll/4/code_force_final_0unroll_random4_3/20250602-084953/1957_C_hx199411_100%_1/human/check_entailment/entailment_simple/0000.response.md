Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when the game continues after k moves. The program first calculates the number of moves that have already been made, including the computer's mirrored moves. It then calculates the number of remaining moves (m) by subtracting the number of moves already made from the total number of moves (n). If there are no remaining moves (m == 0), there is only one possible configuration. If there is only one remaining move (m == 1), there is also only one possible configuration. For more than one remaining move (m > 1), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The dynamic programming approach is correct, as it considers all possible moves and their corresponding configurations. The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

Correctness: **True**
