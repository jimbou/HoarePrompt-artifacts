Functionality: **This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given array 'a' of non-negative integers, such that the XOR of all elements in the subarray equals zero. It takes as input the length of the array 'n', the number of queries 'q', the array 'a', and 'q' pairs of indices 'l' and 'r' representing the subarray ranges to be queried. The function prints 'Yes' if a subarray with XOR equal to zero exists within the specified range, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not modify the input array or any other variables, and its output is solely based on the printed results of the queries.**
