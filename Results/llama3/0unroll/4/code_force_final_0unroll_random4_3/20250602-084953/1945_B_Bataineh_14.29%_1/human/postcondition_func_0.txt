This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of three integers a, b, and m. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make a and b equal to m. If m is less than either a or b, it outputs 2. Otherwise, it outputs the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and b, plus 2. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.
