Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The issue lies in the line where it prints the result. The correct calculation should be `m // a + m // b + 2` only when `m >= a` and `m >= b`. However, when `m < a` or `m < b`, the program simply prints 2, which is incorrect.

For example, if `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 2`, the program will print 2, but the correct answer is 3. This is because the first installation will launch fireworks at minutes 0 and 3, and the second installation will launch a firework at minute 0, and all three fireworks will be visible in the sky at minute 0.

The correct program should handle the cases where `m < a` or `m < b` separately, and calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time accordingly.
