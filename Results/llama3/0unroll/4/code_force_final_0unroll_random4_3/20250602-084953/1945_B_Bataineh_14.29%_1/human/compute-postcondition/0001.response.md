Output State: **The output will be a series of integers, each representing the minimum number of operations required to make a and b equal to m. If m is less than either a or b, the output will be 2. Otherwise, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of m by a and b, plus 2. The number of output lines will be equal to the value of t.**
