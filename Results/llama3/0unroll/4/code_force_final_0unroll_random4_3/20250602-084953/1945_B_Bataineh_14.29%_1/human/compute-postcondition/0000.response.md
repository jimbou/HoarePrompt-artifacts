Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains t lines, each containing three integers a, b, and m, with the same constraints as before (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18).
