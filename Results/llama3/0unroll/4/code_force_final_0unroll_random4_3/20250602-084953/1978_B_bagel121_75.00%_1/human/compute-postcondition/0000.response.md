The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, the first integer is read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)**
