Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum sum that can be obtained based on the values of n, a, and b. If a is greater than or equal to b, the maximum sum is n * a. Otherwise, the maximum sum is calculated using the formula (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k + (n - k) * a, where k is the minimum of b - a + 1 and n. The function outputs a series of integers, each representing the maximum sum for a test case, with the number of integers equal to the number of test cases.**
