Output State: **The output state is a series of integers, each representing the maximum sum that can be obtained from a test case. The number of integers in the output state is equal to the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Each integer is calculated based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` in each test case, using the formula `n * a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, or `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k + (n - k) * a` if `a` is less than `b`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**
