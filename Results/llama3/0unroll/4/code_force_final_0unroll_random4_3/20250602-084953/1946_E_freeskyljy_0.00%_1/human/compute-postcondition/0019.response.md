Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N, R is a list of M2 integers with the first element being between 1 and N. If M2 > 1, then i = N, cur = M2, ans = ans * (nums_left - (N - R[0] - 1)) % MOD, and nums_left = 0. Otherwise, the values of i, cur, ans, and nums_left remain unchanged.***
