Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. It checks for the necessary conditions such as the last prefix maximum being equal to the first suffix maximum, and the first prefix maximum being 1 and the last suffix maximum being N. It also checks for the condition where M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and the second last prefix maximum being equal to the second suffix maximum.

The program then calculates the number of permutations using the formula for combinations and iteratively multiplies it with the remaining numbers on the left and right sides. It handles the cases where M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 separately and correctly updates the answer.

The program does not have any obvious logical errors and correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
