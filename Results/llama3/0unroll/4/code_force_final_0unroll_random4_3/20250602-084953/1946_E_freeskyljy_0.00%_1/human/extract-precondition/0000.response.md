Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m1, and m2 (1 <= n, m1, m2 <= 2 * 10^5). The second and third lines contain m1 and m2 integers respectively, representing the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums in increasing order. The integers in the second and third lines are between 1 and n.**
