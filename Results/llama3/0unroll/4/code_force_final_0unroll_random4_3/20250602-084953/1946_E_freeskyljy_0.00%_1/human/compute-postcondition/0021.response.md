Functionality: **This function determines the number of valid combinations of prefix maximums and suffix maximums in an array of length N. It takes as input the length of the array (N), the number of prefix maximums (M1), the number of suffix maximums (M2), and the indices of the prefix maximums (L) and suffix maximums (R). If the last element of L is not equal to the first element of R, or if the first element of L is not 1 or the first element of R is not N, the function returns 0. If M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1 and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R, the function also returns 0. Otherwise, the function calculates the number of combinations using the formula (N-1)! / (L[-1]-1)! (R[0]-L[-1])! % MOD, where MOD is a predefined modulus. The function returns this calculated value.**
