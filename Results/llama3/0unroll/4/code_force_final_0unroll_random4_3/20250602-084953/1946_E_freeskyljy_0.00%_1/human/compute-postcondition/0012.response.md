Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The first element of L is 1 and the first element of R is N. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. Either M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. The current value of ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, and the current value of cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.**
