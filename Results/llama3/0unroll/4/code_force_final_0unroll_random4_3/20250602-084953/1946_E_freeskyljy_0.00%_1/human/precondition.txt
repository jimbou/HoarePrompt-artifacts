stdin contains several test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m1, and m2, where n is the length of the permutation, m1 is the number of prefix maximums, and m2 is the number of suffix maximums. The next two lines of each test case contain m1 and m2 integers, respectively, representing the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums in increasing order. 1 <= n, m1, m2 <= 2 * 10^5.
