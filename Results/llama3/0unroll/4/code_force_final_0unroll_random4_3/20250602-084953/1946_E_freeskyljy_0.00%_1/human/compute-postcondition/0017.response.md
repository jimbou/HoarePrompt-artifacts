Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N, R is a list of M2 integers with the first element being between 1 and N, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1, ans is unchanged, and the value of i is 1 if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise, the values of ans, cur, and i remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of N, M1, M2, L, R, and nums_left remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of cur is updated to 1, and the value of i is updated to R[0] + 1. The value of ans remains unchanged, and the value of i is 1 if M1 is larger than 1, otherwise, the values of ans, cur, and i remain unchanged.
