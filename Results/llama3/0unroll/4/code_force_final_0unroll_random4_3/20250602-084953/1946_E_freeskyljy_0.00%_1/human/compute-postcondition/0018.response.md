Output State: **i = N, cur = M2, ans = ans * (nums_left - (N - R[0] - 1)) % MOD, nums_left = 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The variable `i` will be equal to `N`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the range from `R[0] + 1` to `N`.
*   The variable `cur` will be equal to `M2`, indicating that the loop has checked all elements in the list `R`.
*   The variable `ans` will be updated to `ans * (nums_left - (N - R[0] - 1)) % MOD`, which represents the cumulative product of the remaining numbers in the range from `R[0] + 1` to `N`, excluding the numbers in the list `R`.
*   The variable `nums_left` will be equal to `0`, indicating that all numbers in the range from `R[0] + 1` to `N` have been processed.

In summary, the loop has iterated over the range from `R[0] + 1` to `N`, updating the variables `cur`, `ans`, and `nums_left` accordingly. The final state reflects the completion of the loop's iterations and the updated values of the variables involved in the loop.
