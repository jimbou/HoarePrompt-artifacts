Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer greater than 1 and between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. The first element of L is 1 and the first element of R is N. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. Either M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. The current value of ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, and the current value of cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
