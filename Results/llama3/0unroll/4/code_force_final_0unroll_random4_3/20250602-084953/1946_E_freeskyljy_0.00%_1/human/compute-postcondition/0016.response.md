Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N, R is a list of M2 integers with the first element being between 1 and N, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. If M1 is larger than 1, the current value of ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, the current value of cur is 0, and the current value of i is 1. Otherwise, the values of ans, cur, and i remain unchanged.**
