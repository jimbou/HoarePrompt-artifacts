Postcondition: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N. If M1 is larger than 1, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is 0, nums_left is 0, and i is 1. Otherwise, the values of ans, cur, nums_left, and i remain unchanged.**
