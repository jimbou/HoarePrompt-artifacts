Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N, R is a list of M2 integers between 1 and N, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the first line of input to N, M1, and M2. The second line assigns a list of M1 integers from the second line of input to L. The third line assigns a list of M2 integers from the third line of input to R. No other variables are affected. After the execution of the code, stdin contains one less test case.
