Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M1 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, M2 is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, L is a list of M1 integers between 1 and N, R is a list of M2 integers with the first element being between 1 and N, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. If M1 is larger than 1, ans is the number of combinations of N - 1 items taken L[-1] - 1 at a time, cur is 0, and i is 1. Otherwise, the values of ans, cur, and i remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of nums_left is updated to be N - R[0] - 1, where R[0] is the first element of the list R, which is an integer between 1 and N. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. If M1 is larger than 1, the values of ans, cur, and i are also updated accordingly.
