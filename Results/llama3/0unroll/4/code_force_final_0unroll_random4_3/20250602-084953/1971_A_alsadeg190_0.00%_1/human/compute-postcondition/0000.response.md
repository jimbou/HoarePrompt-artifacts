Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains x lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `x` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) because it is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer t (1 <= t <= 100). The stdin now contains x lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), because the first input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
