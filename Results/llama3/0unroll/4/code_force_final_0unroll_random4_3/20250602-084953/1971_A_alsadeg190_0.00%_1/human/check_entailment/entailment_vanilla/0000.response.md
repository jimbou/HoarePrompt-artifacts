Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires us to find the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments.
3. Inside the function, it reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
4. The function then iterates `x` times, reading two integers `x` and `y` from the input in each iteration.
5. The program then checks if `x` is greater than `y`. If true, it prints `x` and `y` in that order. Otherwise, it prints `y` and `x` in that order.
6. The program does not explicitly find the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`. Instead, it relies on the comparison `x > y` to determine the order of printing.
7. However, this approach is correct because when `x > y`, printing `x` and `y` in that order gives the maximum and minimum, respectively. Similarly, when `x <= y`, printing `y` and `x` in that order gives the maximum and minimum, respectively.

Correctness: **True**
