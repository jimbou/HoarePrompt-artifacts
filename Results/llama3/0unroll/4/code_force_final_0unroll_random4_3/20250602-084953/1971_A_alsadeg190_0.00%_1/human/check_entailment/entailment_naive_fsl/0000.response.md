Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input values of x and y are equal. In such cases, the program prints the values in the order they are input, rather than printing the minimum followed by the maximum. For example, if the input is "3 3", the program will print "3 3", but the correct output should be "3 3" because the minimum and maximum are the same.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to handle the case where x and y are equal. One possible solution is to use the built-in min and max functions in Python, which can handle this case correctly. Here is an example of how the program could be modified:

```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```

This modified program will correctly output the minimum and maximum values for all possible inputs, including cases where x and y are equal.
