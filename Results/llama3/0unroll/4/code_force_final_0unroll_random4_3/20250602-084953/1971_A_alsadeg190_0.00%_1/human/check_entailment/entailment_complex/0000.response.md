Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y for each test case. The program reads an integer t, which represents the number of test cases, and then reads t lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y.

The program then uses a simple if-else statement to determine the minimum and maximum of x and y. If x is greater than y, it prints x and y in that order; otherwise, it prints y and x in that order. This logic is correct because it ensures that the smaller value is always printed first, followed by the larger value.

The program iterates this process for each test case, printing the minimum and maximum values for each pair of x and y.

Based on the provided execution states, the program produces the correct output for each test case, as shown in the example output.

Therefore, the program is correct in solving the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
