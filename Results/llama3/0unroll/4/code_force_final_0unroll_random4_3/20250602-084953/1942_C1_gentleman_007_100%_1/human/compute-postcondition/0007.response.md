Functionality: This function takes two lists of values, `a` and `b`, as input and returns the longest common subsequence of the two lists as a string. The function constructs a 2D table to store the lengths of common subsequences and then uses this table to construct the longest common subsequence in reverse order, finally reversing it to return the result in the original order.
