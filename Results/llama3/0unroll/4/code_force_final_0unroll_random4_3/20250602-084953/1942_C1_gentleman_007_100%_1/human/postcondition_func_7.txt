Functionality: This function calculates and returns a 2D list of integers representing the cumulative sum of submatrices within a given 2D list of integers. It takes a 2D list of integers as input and returns a new 2D list with one additional row and column, where each element at position [i][j] represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner to the cell at row i-1 and column j-1.
