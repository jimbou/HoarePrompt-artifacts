This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list of integers `Prime_array` as input, where `Prime_array[i]` is a prime factor of `i` for all `i` in the range of indices of `Prime_array`. It returns a dictionary `d` where the keys are the prime factors of the initial value of `num` and the values are their respective multiplicities. If the input `num` is 1, the function returns an empty dictionary.
