The function constructs and returns a list of n+1 sublists, where each sublist is initially empty. It then iterates m times, appending a pair of values (x, y) to the sublists at indices x and y, respectively, where x and y are determined by the output of an external function func_1(). The function returns the constructed list, which has a total of n+1 sublists, with each sublist at indices x and y having one additional element appended to it, as determined by the output of func_1() in each iteration.
