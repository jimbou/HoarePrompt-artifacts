# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#Overall this is what the function does:Creates a 2D list (or matrix) with a specified number of rows and columns, where every element is initialized with a given value. The function takes three parameters: the number of rows (n), the number of columns (m), and the value to fill the matrix with (v), and returns the constructed matrix.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs and returns a list of n+1 sublists, where each sublist is initially empty. It then iterates m times, appending a pair of values (x, y) to the sublists at indices x and y, respectively, where x and y are determined by the output of an external function func_1().

The function returns the 2D list, which represents a graph with m pairs of connected nodes, where each pair is generated by an external function func_1(). The graph is undirected, meaning that if node x is connected to node y, then node y is also connected to node x.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function calculates and returns a 2D list of integers representing the cumulative sum of submatrices within a given 2D list of integers. It takes a 2D list of integers as input and returns a new 2D list with one additional row and column, where each element at position [i][j] represents the sum of all elements in the submatrix from the top-left corner to the cell at row i-1 and column j-1.

    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of the non-negative integer x, or 0 if x is 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-negative integer x as input and returns the number of trailing zeros in its binary representation. If x is 0, it returns 0.

#Function 10:

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in a given list. It takes a list of integers as input and returns a single integer value, which is the GCD of all elements in the list. The function does not modify the original list.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-negative integer `num` as input and returns a list of all prime numbers up to `num`. The function does not modify the input `num`. It generates three lists: `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime`, which contain boolean values indicating whether each number is prime or not, the highest prime factor of each number, and the lowest prime factor of each number, respectively. The function then uses these lists to generate a list of all prime numbers up to `num`, which is returned as the output.

    #The program returns a dictionary d where the keys are the prime factors of the initial value of num (which is 1) and the values are their respective multiplicities. Since 1 has no prime factors, the dictionary d is empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer `num` and a list of integers `Prime_array` as input, where `Prime_array[i]` is a prime factor of `i` for all `i` in the range of indices of `Prime_array`. It returns a dictionary `d` where the keys are the prime factors of the initial value of `num` and the values are their respective multiplicities.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer n as input and returns a dictionary containing the prime factors of n and their corresponding powers. If n is a prime number greater than 1, it is included in the dictionary with a power of 1. The function reduces n to 1 by iteratively dividing it by its smallest prime factors, which are stored in the dictionary. The resulting dictionary contains all prime factors of the original number n, including 1 if n was originally greater than 1.

If the modulus (mod) is -1, the function returns a list containing the integers 1, 0, and all the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth Fibonacci number. If the modulus is a positive integer, the function returns a list containing the first n Fibonacci numbers modulo the modulus, with the first two elements being 1 and 0, respectively.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: p is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, x is an integer
    n = len(p)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    if (p[-1] < x) :
        return n
        #The program returns the number of elements in the list p, which is the same as the number of integers in the sorted list p.
    #State: *p is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, x is an integer, n is the number of elements in p, l is 0, r is the last index of p, and the last element of p is larger than or equal to x

    #State: l is the index of the smallest element in p that is greater than or equal to x, r is the index of the largest element in p that is less than x, mid is the index of the smallest element in p that is greater than or equal to x, and the values of p, x, and n remain unchanged.
    return mid
    #The program returns the index of the smallest element in list p that is greater than or equal to x.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a sorted list of integers to find the index of the smallest element that is greater than or equal to a given integer. If the given integer is larger than all elements in the list, the function returns the length of the list. The function takes a sorted list of integers and an integer as input and returns an index or the length of the list, depending on the search result.

#Function 20:

    if (x == 0 or x == 1) :

    #State: l is the integer square root of x, and r is the integer square root of x.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the integer square root of a non-negative integer x. It returns the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x. If x is 0 or 1, it returns x. Otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the integer square root, returning the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.

#Function 21:

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the modular exponentiation of a number 'a' raised to the power 'b' under modulo 'mod'. It takes three integers as input: 'a', 'b', and 'mod', where 'mod' is non-zero and 'a' and 'b' are non-negative. The function returns the result of a^(b) % mod, leaving the input variables unchanged.

#Function 22:

    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` as a string in its original order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two lists of values, `a` and `b`, as input and returns the longest common subsequence of the two lists as a string in its original order. The function constructs a 2D table to store the lengths of common subsequences and then uses this table to backtrack and construct the longest common subsequence. The function returns a string representation of this subsequence, in the original order of its elements.

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `l` is a sorted list of integers.
    return len(l)
    #The program returns the number of elements in the sorted list 'l' of integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the number of unique integers in the sorted list. The function does not modify the original input list.

#Function 24:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a valid vertex in the graph, graph is a dictionary where the keys are vertices and the values are lists of adjacent vertices, and vis is a list where vis[i] represents whether vertex i has been visited or not.
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)

        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: stack is an empty list, vis is a list where vis[i] represents whether vertex i has been visited or not, with vis[i] being 1 for all vertices i in the graph that are reachable from ver, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:Performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a graph starting from a given vertex, marking all reachable vertices as visited and printing them in the order they are visited. The function modifies the input list 'vis' to reflect the visited state of each vertex and leaves the graph and other variables unchanged.

#Function 25:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a graph, and vis is a list or dictionary keeping track of visited nodes.
    q = deque()

                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: q is an empty deque, vis is a list or dictionary with all nodes in the graph marked as visited (vis[node] is 1 for all nodes in the graph), and the console output contains all nodes in the graph in the order they were visited.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a breadth-first traversal of a graph, starting from a given node, and prints the nodes in the order they are visited. It also marks all visited nodes in a separate data structure. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the visited nodes data structure and prints the traversal order to the console.
