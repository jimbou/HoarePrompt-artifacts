Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list of elements of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order, `s` is a string representation of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b`**.

In this output state, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The list `l` still contains the elements of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order. The new variable `s` is assigned the string representation of the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b`, which is created by joining the elements of `l` into a single string using the `join` method.
