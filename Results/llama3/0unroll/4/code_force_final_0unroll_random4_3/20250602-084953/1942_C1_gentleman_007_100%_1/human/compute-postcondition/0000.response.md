Output State: **ver is a node in the graph, graph is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of a graph, q is a deque containing the node ver, and vis is a list or dictionary with the node ver marked as visited (vis[ver] is 1).**

In this output state, the code has added a new variable `q`, which is a deque data structure containing the node `ver`. The `vis` data structure, which keeps track of visited nodes, has been updated to mark the node `ver` as visited by setting `vis[ver]` to 1. The other variables, `ver` and `graph`, remain unchanged.
