The function generates a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) where some elements are set to 1, representing pairs of connections between nodes. It takes two parameters, n and m, where n is a positive integer and m is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n. The function returns the 2D list, which represents a graph with m pairs of connected nodes, where each pair is generated by an external function func_1(). The graph is undirected, meaning that if node x is connected to node y, then node y is also connected to node x.
