Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (x) is equal to the number of sides of the polygon (n). In this case, the program should return 0 because no more vertices can be chosen, but the program does not have a condition to handle this case.

For example, if the input is:

3
8 8 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

The program should return 0, but it does not have a condition to handle this case and will return an incorrect result.
