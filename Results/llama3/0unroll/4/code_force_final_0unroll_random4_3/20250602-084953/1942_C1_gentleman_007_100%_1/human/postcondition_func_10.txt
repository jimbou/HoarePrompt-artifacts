This function takes a non-negative integer `num` as input and returns a list of all prime numbers up to `num`. The function does not modify the input `num`. It generates three lists: `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime`, which contain boolean values indicating whether each number is prime or not, the highest prime factor of each number, and the lowest prime factor of each number, respectively. The function then uses these lists to generate a list of all prime numbers up to `num`, which is returned as the output.
