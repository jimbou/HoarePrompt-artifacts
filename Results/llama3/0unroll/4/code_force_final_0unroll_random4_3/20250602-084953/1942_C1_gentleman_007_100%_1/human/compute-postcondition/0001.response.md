Output State: **q is an empty deque, vis is a list or dictionary with all nodes in the graph marked as visited (vis[node] is 1 for all nodes in the graph), and the console output contains all nodes in the graph in the order they were visited.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the queue `q` will be empty because all nodes have been dequeued and processed. The `vis` list or dictionary will have all nodes in the graph marked as visited, indicating that each node has been processed at least once. Additionally, the console will display all nodes in the graph in the order they were visited, which is the order in which they were dequeued from `q`.
