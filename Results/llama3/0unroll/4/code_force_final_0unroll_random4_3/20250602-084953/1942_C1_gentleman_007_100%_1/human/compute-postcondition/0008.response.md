Functionality: **This function takes two lists of values, `a` and `b`, as input and returns the longest common subsequence of the two lists as a string in its original order. The function constructs a 2D table to store the lengths of common subsequences and then uses this table to backtrack and construct the longest common subsequence. The function returns a string representation of this subsequence, in the original order of its elements.**
