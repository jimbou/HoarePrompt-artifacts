You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, mod is an integer that can be either -1 or a positive integer.
    if (mod == -1) :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]))
            
        #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `mod` is -1, `dearr` is a list containing the integers 1, 0, and all the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth Fibonacci number.
    else :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod)
            
        #State: Output State: The list `dearr` contains the first `n` Fibonacci numbers modulo `mod`, with the first two elements being 1 and 0, respectively.
    #State: *n is a positive integer, mod is an integer that can be either -1 or a positive integer. If mod is -1, then the list dearr contains the integers 1, 0, and all the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth Fibonacci number. If mod is not -1, then the list dearr contains the first n Fibonacci numbers modulo mod, with the first two elements being 1 and 0, respectively.
    return dearr
    #The program returns a list of Fibonacci numbers. If mod is -1, the list contains the integers 1, 0, and all the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth Fibonacci number. If mod is not -1, the list contains the first n Fibonacci numbers modulo mod, with the first two elements being 1 and 0, respectively.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of Fibonacci numbers. If mod is -1, the list contains the integers 1, 0, and all the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth Fibonacci number. If mod is not -1, the list contains the first n Fibonacci numbers modulo mod, with the first two elements being 1 and 0, respectively.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
