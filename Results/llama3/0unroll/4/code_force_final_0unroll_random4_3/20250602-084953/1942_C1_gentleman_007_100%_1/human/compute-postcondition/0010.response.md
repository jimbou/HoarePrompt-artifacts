Functionality: **This function generates a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the nth number, where n is a positive integer. If the modulus (mod) is -1, the function returns a list containing the integers 1, 0, and all the Fibonacci numbers up to the nth Fibonacci number. If the modulus is a positive integer, the function returns a list containing the first n Fibonacci numbers modulo the modulus, with the first two elements being 1 and 0, respectively. The function takes two parameters, n and mod, and returns a list of Fibonacci numbers based on the value of mod.**
