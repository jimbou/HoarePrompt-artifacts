This function takes a positive integer n as input and returns a dictionary containing the prime factors of n and their corresponding powers. If n is a prime number greater than 1, it is included in the dictionary with a power of 1. The function reduces n to 1 by iteratively dividing it by its smallest prime factors, which are stored in the dictionary. The resulting dictionary contains all prime factors of the original number n, including 1 if n was originally greater than 1.
