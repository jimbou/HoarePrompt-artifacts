Functionality: **This function determines the winner of a game based on a list of unique integers. It takes a list of integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the list, and then checks the differences between consecutive integers. If the length of the list is 2, the function outputs 'Alice'. Otherwise, it calculates the XOR of the differences between consecutive integers and outputs 'Alice' if the result is 1, and 'Bob' otherwise. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the winner for each case.**
