Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The program first removes duplicates from the input list by converting it to a set, then sorts the unique integers. If the length of the unique integers is 2, it directly outputs 'Alice' as the winner. Otherwise, it calculates the XOR of the differences between consecutive unique integers and outputs 'Alice' if the result is 1, and 'Bob' otherwise. This logic is correct based on the problem description, which states that the first player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Correctness: **True**
