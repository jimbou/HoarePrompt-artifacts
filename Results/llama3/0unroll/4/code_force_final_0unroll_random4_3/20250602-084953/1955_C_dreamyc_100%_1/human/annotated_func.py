    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, ans is the number of times the sum of the first i elements of nums is less than or equal to a or the sum of the last i elements of nums is less than or equal to b, s_a is the sum of all elements in nums, s_b is the sum of all elements in nums.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times the sum of the first i elements of nums is less than or equal to the ceiling of k divided by 2 or the sum of the last i elements of nums is less than or equal to the floor of k divided by 2, where nums is a list of n positive integers, n is a positive integer, and k is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of times a sum of elements in a list meets a certain condition. It takes three parameters: a positive integer 'n', a positive integer 'k', and a list of 'n' positive integers 'nums'. If the sum of the elements in 'nums' is less than or equal to 'k', the function returns the number of positive integers in 'nums', which is 'n'. Otherwise, it calculates the ceiling and floor of 'k' divided by 2, and then iterates through 'nums' from both ends, counting the number of times the sum of the first 'i' elements is less than or equal to the ceiling or the sum of the last 'i' elements is less than or equal to the floor. The function returns this count.
