You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers.
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the number of positive integers in the list 'nums', which is a positive integer 'n'.
    #State: *n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers. The sum of the elements in nums is larger than k
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, nums is a list of n positive integers, a is the ceiling of k divided by 2, b is the floor of k divided by 2, ans is the number of times the sum of the first i elements of nums is less than or equal to a or the sum of the last i elements of nums is less than or equal to b, s_a is the sum of all elements in nums, s_b is the sum of all elements in nums.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of times the sum of the first i elements of nums is less than or equal to the ceiling of k divided by 2 or the sum of the last i elements of nums is less than or equal to the floor of k divided by 2, where nums is a list of n positive integers, n is a positive integer, and k is a positive integer.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number of positive integers in the list 'nums', which is a positive integer 'n'.

Case_2: The program returns the number of times the sum of the first i elements of nums is less than or equal to the ceiling of k divided by 2 or the sum of the last i elements of nums is less than or equal to the floor of k divided by 2, where nums is a list of n positive integers, n is a positive integer, and k is a positive integer.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
