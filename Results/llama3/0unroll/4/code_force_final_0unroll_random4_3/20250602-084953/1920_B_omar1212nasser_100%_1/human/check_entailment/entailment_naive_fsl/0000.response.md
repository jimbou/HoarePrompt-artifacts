Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` reads the input, sorts the array, and calls `func_2` to calculate the maximum sum of elements after the game. `func_2` calculates the maximum sum by considering all possible removals and negations.

The program correctly implements the game strategy. It first sorts the array in ascending order, which allows it to easily identify the smallest elements that Bob can negate to minimize the sum. Then, it calculates the maximum sum by considering all possible removals and negations.

The program handles all edge cases correctly. For example, if Alice can remove all elements, the program correctly returns 0. If Bob can negate all elements, the program correctly returns the negative sum of all elements.

The program also handles cases where the number of removals or negations is 0. In these cases, the program correctly returns the sum of all elements or the negative sum of all elements, respectively.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly implements the game strategy and handles all edge cases.
