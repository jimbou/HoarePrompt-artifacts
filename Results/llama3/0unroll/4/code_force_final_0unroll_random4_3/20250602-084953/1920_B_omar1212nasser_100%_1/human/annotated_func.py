#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= x <= n. a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i.
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads input for `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, calculates the product using the `func_2` function, and prints the result. After all iterations, the loop finishes, and the program terminates. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated in each iteration, but their initial values are not retained. The output state is the final printed product value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input for the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads input for the number of elements, a target value, and a list of integers. It sorts the list of integers and calculates a product using the `func_2` function, which is not shown in the provided code. The function then prints the calculated product. After all test cases have been processed, the function terminates.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: Output State: removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements where the first element is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements and the rest of the elements are the result of the loop execution, s is the sum of the first len(elements) - removals elements in elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements if removals is less than or equal to negatives, otherwise s2 is 0.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list 'pos', which contains 'removals + 1' elements. The first element in 'pos' is the sum of all elements in 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements'. The rest of the elements in 'pos' are the result of the loop execution. The maximum value is determined from these 'removals + 1' elements.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the maximum value that can be obtained by removing a specified number of elements from a sorted list of integers and subtracting twice the sum of a specified number of negative elements from the remaining sum. The function takes three parameters: a non-negative integer 'removals', a non-negative integer 'negatives', and a list of integers 'elements' sorted in ascending order. It returns the maximum value that can be obtained by performing the specified removals and subtractions.
