The function reads input for the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads input for the number of elements, a target value, and a list of integers. It sorts the list of integers and calculates a product using the `func_2` function, which is not shown in the provided code. The function then prints the calculated product. After all test cases have been processed, the function terminates.
