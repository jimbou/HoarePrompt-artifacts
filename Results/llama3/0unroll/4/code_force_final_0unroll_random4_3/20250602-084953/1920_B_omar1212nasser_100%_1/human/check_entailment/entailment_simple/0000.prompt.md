Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    2 2 1
    
    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= x <= n. a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 1000 for all i.
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads input for `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, calculates the product using the `func_2` function, and prints the result. After all iterations, the loop finishes, and the program terminates. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are updated in each iteration, but their initial values are not retained. The output state is the final printed product value.


#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals and negatives are non-negative integers, and elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: Output State: removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing removals + 1 elements where the first element is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements and the rest of the elements are the result of the loop execution, s is the sum of the first len(elements) - removals elements in elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements if removals is less than or equal to negatives, otherwise s2 is 0.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list 'pos', which contains 'removals + 1' elements. The first element in 'pos' is the sum of all elements in 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements'. The rest of the elements in 'pos' are the result of the loop execution. The maximum value is determined from these 'removals + 1' elements.
