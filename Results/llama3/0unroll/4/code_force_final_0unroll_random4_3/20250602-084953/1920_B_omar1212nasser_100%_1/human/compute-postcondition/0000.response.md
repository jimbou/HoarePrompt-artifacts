Output State: **removals is a non-negative integer, negatives is a non-negative integer, elements is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, pos is a list containing one element which is the sum of all elements in elements minus twice the sum of the last negatives elements in elements, s is the sum of all elements in elements, s2 is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements.**

In this output state, the values of removals and negatives remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list elements also remains unchanged as it is only used to calculate the sum and the last negatives elements, but its original values are not modified. The list pos is created and contains one element which is the result of the calculation s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]), where s is the sum of all elements in elements and sum(elements[-negatives:]) is the sum of the last negatives elements in elements. The variable s is assigned the sum of all elements in elements, and s2 is assigned the sum of the last negatives elements in elements.
