The code `a = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `a`. The stdin contains a number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. So, `a` is assigned the value of the first integer which is the number of test cases `t`. The stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively.

Output State: **`a` is the number of test cases `t`, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively.**
