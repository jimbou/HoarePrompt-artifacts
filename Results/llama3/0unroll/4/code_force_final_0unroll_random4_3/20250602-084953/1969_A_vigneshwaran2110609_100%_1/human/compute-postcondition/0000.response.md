Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n distinct integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_n (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `n` now holds an integer value between 2 and 50 (inclusive), which is the number of distinct integers in the current test case. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains `n` distinct integers `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (1 <= p_i <= n; p_i != i).
