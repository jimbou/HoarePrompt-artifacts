This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs a series of numbers (either 2 or 3) based on the input values. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index i such that the value at index i in the list is equal to i+1. If such an index exists, it outputs 2; otherwise, it outputs 3. The function processes a variable number of test cases, as specified by the initial input, and produces a corresponding number of output lines.
