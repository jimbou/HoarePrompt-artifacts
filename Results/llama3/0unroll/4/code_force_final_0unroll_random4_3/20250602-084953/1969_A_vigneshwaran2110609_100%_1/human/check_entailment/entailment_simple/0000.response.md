Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there exists an index i such that the value at index i in the list is equal to i+1. If such an index exists, it means that the i-th friend and the (i+1)-th friend are each other's best friends, and sending invitations to both of them will result in at least 2 friends coming to the party. In this case, the program prints 2. If no such index exists, it means that sending invitations to at least 3 friends is required to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, the program prints 3.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of friends and the list of best friends. It then prints the minimum number of invitations required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
