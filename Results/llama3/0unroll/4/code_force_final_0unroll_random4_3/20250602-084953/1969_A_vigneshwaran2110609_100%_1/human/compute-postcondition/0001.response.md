Output State: **The output state will be a series of numbers, either 2 or 3, each on a new line, depending on the input values. For each test case, if there exists an index i such that the value at index i in the list is equal to i+1, then the output will be 2. Otherwise, the output will be 3. The number of output lines will be equal to the number of test cases (t-1).**
