Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the number of screens required to display a series of input values, where each input consists of two integers x and y. It reads the number of test cases (t) and then t lines of input, each containing x and y. For each input pair, it determines the total space required, calculates the number of screens needed to display y, and checks if there is enough remaining space to display x. If there is not enough space, it calculates the additional screens required to display x. The function then prints a list of n integers, where n is the number of test cases, and each integer represents the total number of screens required to display the corresponding input values of x and y.**
