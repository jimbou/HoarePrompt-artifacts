Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4, result is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 99).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which is the value read from the first line of stdin. The `result` variable is an empty list, as it was initialized with an empty list. Stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y`, since the first line was read to assign the value to `n`.
