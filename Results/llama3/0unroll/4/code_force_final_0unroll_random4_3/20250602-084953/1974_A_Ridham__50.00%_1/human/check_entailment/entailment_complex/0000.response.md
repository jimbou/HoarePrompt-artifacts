Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (t) and then t lines of input, each containing two integers x and y.

2. For each input pair, it calculates the total space required by the 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

3. It correctly calculates the number of screens needed to display the 2x2 icons (y). If y is even, it requires y // 2 screens. If y is odd, it requires y // 2 + 1 screens.

4. It then checks if there is enough remaining space on the screens allocated for the 2x2 icons to display the 1x1 icons (x). If there is enough space, it appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list.

5. If there is not enough space, it calculates the additional screens required to display the 1x1 icons. If the remaining space is a multiple of 15, it requires extra_space // 15 additional screens. Otherwise, it requires extra_space // 15 + 1 additional screens.

6. Finally, it appends the total number of screens required (screens required for 2x2 icons + additional screens required for 1x1 icons) to the result list.

7. After processing all input pairs, it prints the result list, which contains the minimum number of screens required to display each input pair.

Correctness: **True**
