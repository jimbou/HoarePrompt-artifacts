Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle. The program takes the dimensions of the rectangle as input and checks two conditions:

1. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. If one dimension is twice the other, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle can only be cut into two identical rectangles, which cannot be reassembled into a different rectangle.
3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES' because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reassembled into a different rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
