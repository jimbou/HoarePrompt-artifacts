Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles as he wishes.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the rectangle (a and b) and checks the following conditions:

   - If both a and b are odd (i.e., a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0), it prints 'NO'. This is because if both a and b are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.

   - If a is equal to 2 times b or b is equal to 2 times a (i.e., a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a), it prints 'NO'. This is because in such cases, the rectangle can only be cut into two identical rectangles, which does not satisfy the condition of forming another rectangle.

   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. This is because in all other cases, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and these two rectangles can be rotated and moved to form another rectangle.

The program's logic is correct and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
