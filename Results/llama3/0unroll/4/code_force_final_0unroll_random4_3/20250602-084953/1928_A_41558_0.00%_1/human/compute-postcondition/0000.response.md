Output State: **`n` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer larger than 0, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers a and b, where a and b are between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
