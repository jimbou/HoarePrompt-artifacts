This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two space-separated integers a and b. It then checks each test case and prints 'YES' if the numbers can be used to form a valid pair according to certain rules, and 'NO' otherwise. The rules are: if both numbers are odd, or if one number is exactly twice the other, the pair is invalid. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' for each case, leaving the input stream empty and the number of test cases unchanged.
