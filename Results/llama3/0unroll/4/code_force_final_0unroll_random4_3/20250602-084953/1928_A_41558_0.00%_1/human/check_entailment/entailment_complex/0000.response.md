Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. 

The program first checks if both a and b are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed. 

Then, it checks if one number is exactly twice the other. If it is, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed. 

In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because another rectangle can be formed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
