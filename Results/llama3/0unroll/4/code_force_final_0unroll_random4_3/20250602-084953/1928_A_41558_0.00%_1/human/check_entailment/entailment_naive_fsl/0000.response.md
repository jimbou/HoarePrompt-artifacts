Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks two conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "NO" because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.
2. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, it prints "NO" because the rectangle can only be cut into two identical rectangles.
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES" because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
