Output State: **n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1', counter is 0, i is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `counter` and `i`, and assigns them the value 0. The initial state of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remains unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The final state includes the new variables `counter` and `i` with their assigned values, along with the unchanged values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2`.
