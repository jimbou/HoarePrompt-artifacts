#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: i is n, counter is the number of positions where s1 and s2 differ, and the values of n, s1, and s2 remain unchanged.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of positions where strings s1 and s2 differ, and this value is stored in the variable counter, which remains unchanged throughout the execution.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function compares two strings of equal length, consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and returns the number of positions where the strings differ. It does not modify the input strings or their length. The function also handles cases where differences occur in consecutive positions, counting them as a single difference. The returned value represents the total count of differing positions.
