This function compares two strings of equal length, consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and returns the number of positions where the strings differ. It does not modify the input strings or their length. The function also handles cases where differences occur in consecutive positions, counting them as a single difference. The returned value represents the total count of differing positions.
