Output State: **i is n, counter is the number of positions where s1 and s2 differ, and the values of n, s1, and s2 remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations, and the variable i has reached the value n, which is the length of the strings s1 and s2. The counter variable has been incremented each time the loop encountered a position where the characters in s1 and s2 were different. The values of n, s1, and s2 remain unchanged, as they were not modified within the loop.
