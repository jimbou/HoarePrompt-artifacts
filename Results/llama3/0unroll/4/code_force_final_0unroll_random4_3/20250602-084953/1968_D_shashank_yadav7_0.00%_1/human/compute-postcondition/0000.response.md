Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S (1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^9). The next line contains n integers p_1,...,p_n (1 <= p_i <= n) - elements of the permutation p. The next line contains n integers a_1,...,a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) - elements of array a.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the number of test cases from the input, which is an integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers: n, k, P_B, and P_S, followed by two lines of n integers each, representing the permutation p and array a, respectively.
