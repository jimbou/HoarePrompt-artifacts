Output State: The loop will execute t times, and after each execution, it will print either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on the values of bm and sm. The values of n, k, b, s, p, a, sp, bp, bm, and sm will be updated in each iteration. The final output state will be the last printed result, which will be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.
