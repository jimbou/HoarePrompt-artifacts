Output State: **The loop will execute 't' number of times, each time processing a test case from the standard input. For each test case, it will read four integers (n, k, P_B, P_S), then two lists of 'n' integers each (p and a). It will then simulate a game between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', updating their scores based on the values in the lists and the number of rounds 'k'. After each test case, it will print the winner of the game ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on their final scores.**
