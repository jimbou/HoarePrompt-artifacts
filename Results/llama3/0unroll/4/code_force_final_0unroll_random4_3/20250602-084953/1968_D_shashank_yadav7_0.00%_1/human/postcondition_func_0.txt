This function simulates a game between two players, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of rounds, the initial positions of the players, and two lists of integers representing a permutation and an array. It then updates the players' scores based on the values in the lists and the number of rounds, and prints the winner of the game ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on their final scores. The function processes multiple test cases from the standard input and prints the result of each game.
