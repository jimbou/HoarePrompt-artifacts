Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic for the game. The issue lies in the way the scores are updated for Bodya and Sasha. The program uses the maximum of the current score and the score that would be obtained if the player stayed at the same position for the remaining turns. However, this is not the correct way to update the scores.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:

    3
    3 3 1 2
    2 3 1
    1 2 3

In this case, the program will output "Bodya", but the correct output should be "Sasha". The issue arises because the program does not correctly handle the case where a player moves to a position that has a higher score than their current position.

The correct implementation should keep track of the maximum score that can be obtained by a player at each position, and update the scores accordingly. This can be achieved by using dynamic programming to compute the maximum scores for each position and each remaining number of turns.
