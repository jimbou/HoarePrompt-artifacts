Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken after its attack. The program correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, reduces their durability accordingly, and keeps track of the number of ships sunk. It also handles the case where the number of attacks is not enough to sink all ships. The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
