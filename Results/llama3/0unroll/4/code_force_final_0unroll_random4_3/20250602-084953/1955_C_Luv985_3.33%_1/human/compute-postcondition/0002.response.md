Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then calculates the maximum number of pairs of elements in the list that can be made equal to zero by subtracting the same number from both elements, without exceeding k. The result is printed to standard output for each test case.**
