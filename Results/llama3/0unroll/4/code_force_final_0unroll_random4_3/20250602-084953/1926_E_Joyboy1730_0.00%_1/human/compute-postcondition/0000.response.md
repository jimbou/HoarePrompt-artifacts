The code accepts an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) first and then t lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. Since `t` is assigned the value of the first integer in stdin, the remaining input in stdin is t lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`**
