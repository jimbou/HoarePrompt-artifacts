This function reads a series of input values from standard input, where each input set consists of two integers, n and k. It then performs a calculation based on these values, producing a result that is the product of a power of 2 and an odd number (2*k - 1). The function outputs this result for each input set, with the output being a series of integers, one for each input set.
