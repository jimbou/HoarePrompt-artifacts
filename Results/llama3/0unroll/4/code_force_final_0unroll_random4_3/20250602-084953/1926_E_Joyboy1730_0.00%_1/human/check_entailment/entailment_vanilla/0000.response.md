Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by first calculating the number of cards in each category (odd, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) and storing them in a list L. However, the list L is not being populated correctly. The while loop is calculating the number of cards in each category, but it is not storing the values in the list L.

Instead, the program should calculate the number of cards in each category and store them in the list L. Then, it should iterate over the list L and find the category where the k-th card belongs. Once it finds the correct category, it should calculate the value of the k-th card using the formula pow * (2 * k - 1).

Here is the corrected code:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        pow = 1
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            L.append(m)
            n -= m
            pow *= 2
        tot = 0
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow // 2 * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
                break
            tot += a

Correctness: **False**
