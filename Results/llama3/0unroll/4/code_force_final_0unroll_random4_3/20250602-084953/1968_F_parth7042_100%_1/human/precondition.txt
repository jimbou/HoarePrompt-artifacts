stdin contains a number of test cases t, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q, followed by a list of n integers, followed by q pairs of integers. n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, the list of n integers contains non-negative integers less than 2^30, and each pair of integers contains two positive integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
