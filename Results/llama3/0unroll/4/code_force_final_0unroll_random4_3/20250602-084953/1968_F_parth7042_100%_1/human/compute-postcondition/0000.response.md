Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases with each test case containing two integers n and q, and finally n integers a_1, ..., a_n, and q queries, each consisting of two integers l and r, t is an integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings containing the first input of each test case.**

The code snippet reads the first line of input from stdin, which contains multiple test cases, and splits it into a list of strings stored in the variable `data`. It then extracts the first integer `t` from `data` and stores it in the variable `t`. The `index` variable is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list, and it is incremented by 1 after extracting `t`. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list. The remaining inputs in stdin are still present, containing the rest of the test cases.
