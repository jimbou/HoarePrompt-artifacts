Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, two integers n and q, and n integers a_1, ..., a_n, followed by q queries consisting of two integers l and r. It processes each test case by iterating over the queries, and for each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the range [l, r] with an even number of odd elements. If such a subarray exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the results list, where each result corresponds to a query in the order they were given, separated by newline characters.**
