#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer t, then two integers n and q, and finally n integers a_1, ..., a_n. For each test case, there are q queries, each consisting of two integers l and r.
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: stdin is empty, t is 0, index is equal to the total number of inputs, results is a list containing the answers to all the queries in the order they were given, and data is an empty list.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the answers to all the queries in the order they were given, separated by newline characters

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, two integers n and q, and n integers a_1, ..., a_n, followed by q queries consisting of two integers l and r. It processes each test case by iterating over the queries, and for each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the range [l, r] with an even number of odd elements. If such a subarray exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the results list, where each result corresponds to a query in the order they were given, separated by newline characters.
