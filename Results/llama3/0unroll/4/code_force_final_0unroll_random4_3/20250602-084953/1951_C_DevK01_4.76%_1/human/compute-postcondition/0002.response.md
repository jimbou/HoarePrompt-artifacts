Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the variable `t` has been decremented by the number of iterations of the loop. The value of `t` is now equal to the number of test cases minus the number of iterations of the loop. The values of the other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
