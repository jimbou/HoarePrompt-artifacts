Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought at the end (k). It also reads the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program then sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum cost to purchase k tickets. It first calculates the number of days (q) required to purchase k tickets, considering the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m). It then calculates the cost for the first q-1 days and the last day separately.

For the first q-1 days, it calculates the cost by multiplying the number of tickets purchased each day (m) with the sum of the prices for those days, and adds the cost of increasing the prices for the remaining days.

For the last day, it calculates the cost by multiplying the number of tickets purchased (mu) with the price for that day.

Finally, it prints the total cost for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
