Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k). It also reads the prices per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The program then sorts the prices in ascending order and calculates the minimum number of days (q) required to purchase k tickets. It then calculates the cost of purchasing k tickets by considering two cases:

1.  If the total number of tickets that can be purchased in q days is equal to k, it calculates the cost as the sum of the prices of the tickets purchased in each day, plus the additional cost due to the price increase.
2.  If the total number of tickets that can be purchased in q days is less than k, it calculates the cost as the sum of the prices of the tickets purchased in each day, plus the additional cost due to the price increase, plus the cost of purchasing the remaining tickets.

The program then prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Based on the provided execution states, the program seems to be working correctly. It correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
