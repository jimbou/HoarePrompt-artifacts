The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state contains multiple test cases, the first test case is read, and its first line is consumed, which contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `t` is now equal to the first integer of the first test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first integer of the first test case, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, the first line contains two integers `m` and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`.**
