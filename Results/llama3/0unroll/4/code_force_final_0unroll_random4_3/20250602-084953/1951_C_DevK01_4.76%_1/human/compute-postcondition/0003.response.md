Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers (n, m, k) and a list of n integers. It calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given integers and list, and prints the result. The function iterates through all test cases, and after execution, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being the consumption of input test cases.**
