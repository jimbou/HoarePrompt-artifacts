Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The problem description states that the price per ticket increases by x if x tickets are purchased on a particular day, but the program does not take this into account.

For example, consider the input:

4 2 3
8 6 4 2

The program will output 10, but the correct output should be 12. Here's why:

* On day 1, we can buy 0 tickets at a price of 8.
* On day 2, we can buy 0 tickets at a price of 6.
* On day 3, we can buy 1 ticket at a price of 4, increasing the price for the remaining days to [5, 3].
* On day 4, we can buy 2 tickets at a price of 5, increasing the price for the remaining days to [6].

The total cost would be 4 + 5 + 5 = 14, but the program outputs 10.

The program's logic is incorrect, and it does not handle the price increase correctly. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
