Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, considering the constraints of the concert organizers. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and the number of tickets to be bought (k).

The program then sorts the prices of the tickets for each day in ascending order. It calculates the minimum number of days (q) required to buy k tickets, considering the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m). It then calculates the cost of buying k tickets by considering two cases:

1. If the number of days (n) multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m) is equal to the number of tickets to be bought (k), it calculates the cost by multiplying the sum of the prices of the tickets for each day by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m), and adds the additional cost due to the increase in prices.

2. If the number of days (n) multiplied by the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day (m) is not equal to the number of tickets to be bought (k), it calculates the cost by considering the remaining tickets to be bought (mu) and the prices of the tickets for each day.

The program then prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
