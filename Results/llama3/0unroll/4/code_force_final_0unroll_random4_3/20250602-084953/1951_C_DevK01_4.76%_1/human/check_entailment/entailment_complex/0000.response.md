Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the constraints of the concert organizers. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers (n, m, k) and a list of n integers. It calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given integers and list, and prints the result.

The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the three integers (n, m, k) and the list of n integers (M). It then sorts the list M in ascending order and calculates the minimum cost based on the given constraints.

The program uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the total cost. It first calculates the cost for the case where the number of tickets to be purchased (k) is a multiple of the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (m). If k is not a multiple of m, it calculates the cost for the remaining tickets separately.

The program then prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly reads the input, calculates the minimum cost based on the given constraints, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
