The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the number of boxes. The second and third lines contain two strings s and f of length n, where '1' represents a cat in the box and '0' represents an empty box.
