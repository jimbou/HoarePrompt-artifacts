Functionality: **Calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with a given number of extroverts and universals, where each group must have at least 3 people. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the function returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, ensuring that the total number of people in each group is at least 3. If the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3, the function returns None.**
