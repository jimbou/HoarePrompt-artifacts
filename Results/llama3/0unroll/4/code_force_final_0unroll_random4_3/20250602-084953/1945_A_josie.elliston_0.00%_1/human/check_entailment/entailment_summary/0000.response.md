Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with a given number of extroverts and universals, where each group must have at least 3 people. It returns `None` if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of `func_1` called with extroverts and universals as arguments.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with extroverts and universals, and `func_2` correctly returns the total number of tents needed by adding the number of introverts to the result of `func_1`. If `func_1` returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants, `func_2` correctly returns -1.

Correctness: **True**
