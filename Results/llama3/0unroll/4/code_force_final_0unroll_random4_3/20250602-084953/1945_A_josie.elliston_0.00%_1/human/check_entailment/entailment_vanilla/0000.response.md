Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants in a hike, given the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Function 1, `func_1`, takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it means that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals in a way that fulfills all their wishes, so it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

Function 2, `func_2`, takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It first calls `func_1` to get the minimum number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it means that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts (each of whom needs a separate tent) and the result from `func_1`.

The program correctly handles the different cases and constraints specified in the problem description. It ensures that each introvert gets a separate tent, each extrovert is in a tent with two others, and each universal is accommodated according to their preference. It also correctly handles the case where it's impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all their wishes.

Correctness: **True**
