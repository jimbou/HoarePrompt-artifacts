Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

`func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as input and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. In these cases, it's impossible to accommodate the participants, and the program correctly returns -1.

The program also correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is divisible by 3 or the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is greater than or equal to 3. In these cases, the program correctly returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
