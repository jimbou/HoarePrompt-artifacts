Output State: **`introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` are non-negative integers, `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**

In this output state, the values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged as non-negative integers. The code assigns the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to the variable `ret`. The exact value of `ret` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe `ret` as the return value of `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments.
