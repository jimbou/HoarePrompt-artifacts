#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers.
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None.
        #State: extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. The current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3. The sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3
    #State: *extroverts and universals are non-negative integers. If the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, where extroverts and universals are non-negative integers, and if the current value of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is larger than or equal to 3.

#Overall this is what the function does:Calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with a given number of extroverts and universals, where each group must have at least 3 people. If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, the function returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3, ensuring that the total number of people in each group is at least 3. If the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3, the function returns None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the return value of func_1(extroverts, universals), where introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of another function (func_1) called with extroverts and universals as arguments.
