Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` calculates the minimum number of groups that can be formed with a given number of extroverts and universals, where each group must have at least 3 people. It correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3. If the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers (introverts, extroverts, and universals) as input and returns either -1 or the sum of introverts and the result of `func_1` called with extroverts and universals as arguments. If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
