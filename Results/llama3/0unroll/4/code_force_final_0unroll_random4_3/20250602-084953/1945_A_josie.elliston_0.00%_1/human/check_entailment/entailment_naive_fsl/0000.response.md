Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

Function `func_1` correctly handles the case where there are extroverts and universals. It checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and if so, it checks if the remaining extroverts plus the universals can form a complete tent. If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

Function `func_2` calls `func_1` and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When there are only introverts, the program returns the number of introverts.
* When there are only extroverts, the program returns the number of extroverts divided by 3, rounded up.
* When there are only universals, the program returns 0.
* When there are a mix of introverts, extroverts, and universals, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
