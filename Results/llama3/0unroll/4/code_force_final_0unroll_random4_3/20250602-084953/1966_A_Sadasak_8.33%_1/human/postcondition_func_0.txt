This function generates a frequency table from a given list of integers, capping the frequency of each integer at a specified value k. It returns a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer, limited to k. The function accepts a list of integers and an integer k as input, and the length of the list and the value of k are constrained to be within specific ranges. The function does not modify the original list.
