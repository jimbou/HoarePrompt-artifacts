Output State: **The program returns a dictionary called `frequency_table` where each key is a unique integer from the list `arr` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The dictionary contains at most `k` unique integers from `arr`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).**
