Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, the length of `arr` is equal to `n` where 1 <= n <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `arr` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.
