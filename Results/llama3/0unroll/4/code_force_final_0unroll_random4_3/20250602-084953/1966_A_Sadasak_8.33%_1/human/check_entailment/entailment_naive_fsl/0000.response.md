Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations. The program only checks if the frequency of a number is equal to k, and if so, it prints k-1. However, this is not sufficient to find the minimum number of cards.

For example, consider the input:

5 3
1 1 1 2 2

The program will print 5, but the correct answer is 2. This is because we can exchange the three 1's for two 1's, and then exchange the two 2's for one 2, leaving us with two cards.

The program does not correctly handle cases where the frequency of a number is greater than k, and it does not consider the possibility of exchanging cards multiple times to minimize the number of cards left in the hand.
