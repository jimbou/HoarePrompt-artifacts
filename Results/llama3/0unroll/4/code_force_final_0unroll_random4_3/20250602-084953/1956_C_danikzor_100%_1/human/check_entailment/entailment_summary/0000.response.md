Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix, which is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This is because the maximum sum is achieved when the matrix is filled with the numbers from 1 to n^2 in a specific order, and this formula calculates the sum of these numbers.

2. The program correctly generates the operations to achieve this maximum sum. It uses 2n operations, which is within the allowed limit of 2n operations. The operations are of type 1 and type 2, and they assign the numbers from n down to 1 to the rows and columns of the matrix in a specific order.

3. The program correctly prints the operations in the required format. Each operation is printed on a separate line, with the type of operation (1 or 2), the row or column number, and the permutation of numbers from n down to 1.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
