Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to a row or column of the matrix.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix (n) and calculates the maximum sum of numbers that can be achieved in the matrix. This is done using the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, which is derived from the fact that the sum of the first n natural numbers is n * (n + 1) // 2, and the maximum sum is achieved when the numbers are arranged in a specific pattern.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required to achieve it, which is 2 * n. It then prints the operations themselves, which involve assigning a permutation of integers from 1 to n to each row and column of the matrix. The permutation is generated using the range function with a step of -1, which produces a sequence of numbers from n to 1.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem, and it correctly calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations required. The operations themselves are also correctly generated and printed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
