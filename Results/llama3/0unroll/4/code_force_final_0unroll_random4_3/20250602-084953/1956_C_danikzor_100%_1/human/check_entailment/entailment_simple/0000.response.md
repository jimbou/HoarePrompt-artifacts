Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n` and calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is correct because it represents the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
3. The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`.
4. The program then generates the operations to achieve the maximum sum. It does this by iterating over each row and column of the matrix and printing the corresponding operation (either type 1 or type 2) along with the permutation of numbers from `n` down to 1. This is correct because it ensures that each row and column of the matrix contains the numbers from `n` down to 1, which maximizes the sum of the numbers in the matrix.

Overall, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
