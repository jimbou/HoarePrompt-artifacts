Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all numbers in an n x n matrix by performing a series of operations. The program calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations required to achieve this sum.

The program first reads the number of test cases t from standard input. Then, for each test case, it reads an integer n representing the size of the matrix. It calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix using the formula n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, which is the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers. This is a well-known mathematical formula that gives the maximum sum of numbers in an n x n matrix.

The program then prints the calculated maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is twice the value of n. This is because the program performs two operations for each row and column of the matrix.

The program then generates and prints 2n lines of output, each containing the numbers 1 or 2, the current value of i, and the numbers from n down to 1. These lines represent the operations required to achieve the maximum sum. The numbers 1 and 2 represent the type of operation (Type 1 or Type 2), and the current value of i represents the row or column being operated on. The numbers from n down to 1 represent the permutation used in the operation.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the maximum sum of numbers in the matrix and generates the required operations to achieve this sum.

Correctness: **True**
