Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix by performing operations of two types, and the program should provide a solution with no more than 2n operations. However, the program only performs 2n operations without considering the actual maximum sum that can be achieved.

For example, when n = 3, the program will output:

9 6
1 1 3 2 1
2 1 3 2 1
1 2 3 2 1
2 2 3 2 1
1 3 3 2 1
2 3 3 2 1

However, the maximum sum that can be achieved is 21, not 9. The correct solution would be to perform operations that result in the matrix:

3 2 1
2 3 1
1 2 3

Which has a sum of 21.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not always provide the maximum sum that can be achieved with the given operations.
