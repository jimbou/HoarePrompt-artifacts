The code accepts an input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t`. Since `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it will be assigned the value of the first test case, which is the number of test cases `t`. The remaining test cases will still be in the stdin. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
