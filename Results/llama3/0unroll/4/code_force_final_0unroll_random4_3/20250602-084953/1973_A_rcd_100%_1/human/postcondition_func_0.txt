This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers representing the scores of three players. It calculates and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved by the players in each test case, or -1 if it's not possible to achieve a score that is a multiple of 2. The function handles cases where the sum of the scores is odd, where the third player's score is greater than or equal to the sum of the first two players' scores, and where the scores need to be adjusted to achieve the maximum possible score. The output is a series of integers, each representing the maximum possible score for each test case.
