Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1 and moves on to the next test case. This is correct because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the sum.

2.  If the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if the highest score (p3) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (p1 + p2). If it is, the program prints the sum of the other two scores (p1 + p2). This is correct because in this case, the maximum number of draws is achieved when the player with the highest score (p3) plays against the other two players and wins all the games, while the other two players draw all their games against each other.

3.  If the highest score (p3) is not greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (p1 + p2), the program enters a while loop. In this loop, the program increments x and decrements y until y is less than x. The program then checks if p1 - x is less than or equal to p2 - y. If it is, the program prints p1 - x + p3 and breaks out of the loop. This is correct because in this case, the maximum number of draws is achieved when the player with the highest score (p3) plays against the other two players and wins some games, while the other two players draw some games against each other.

4.  If the loop completes without finding a solution, the program prints p3. This is correct because in this case, the maximum number of draws is achieved when the player with the highest score (p3) plays against the other two players and wins all the games.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
