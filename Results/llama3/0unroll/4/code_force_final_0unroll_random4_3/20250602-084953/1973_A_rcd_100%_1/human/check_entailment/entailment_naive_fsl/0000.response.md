Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when p1 = 1, p2 = 1, and p3 = 10. The program prints 2, but the correct answer is 8. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when p3 is much larger than p1 and p2.

In this case, the program should print 8 because the maximum number of draws that could have happened is 8 (p3 - p1 - p2 = 10 - 1 - 1 = 8). However, the program prints 2 because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
