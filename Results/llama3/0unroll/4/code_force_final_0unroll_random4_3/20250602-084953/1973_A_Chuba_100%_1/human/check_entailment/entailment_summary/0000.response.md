Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd, in which case it prints -1. This is because the total number of points awarded in any game is even (either 2 points for a win or 1 point for a draw), so the sum of the scores must be even if the scores are valid.

2.  When the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. It does this by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (which is `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`) from the total number of points, and then dividing the result by 2. This is because each draw awards 1 point to each player, so the maximum number of draws is half the number of points remaining after subtracting the maximum possible number of wins.

3.  The program correctly handles the case where the maximum possible number of wins is negative (i.e., `v[2] - v[0] - v[1] < 0`). In this case, it sets the maximum possible number of wins to 0, which is correct because the number of wins cannot be negative.

4.  The program does not modify the input values or any external state, and its output is solely based on the input test cases. This means that the program is deterministic and will always produce the same output for the same input.

5.  The program correctly handles the case where the input scores are not valid (i.e., the sum of the scores is odd). In this case, it prints -1, which is the correct output according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
