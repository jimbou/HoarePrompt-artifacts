Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The scores are guaranteed to be non-negative and sorted in non-decreasing order.

The provided Python program attempts to solve this problem by first checking if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid set of games that could have resulted in these scores. This is because each game can only result in an even number of points being awarded (either 2 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, or 1 point for a draw).

If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have occurred. It does this by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (i.e., the difference between the highest score and the sum of the two lower scores) from the total number of points awarded, and then dividing the result by 2.

The reasoning behind this calculation is as follows:

* If the highest score is greater than the sum of the two lower scores, it means that the player with the highest score must have won at least one game against each of the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws is 0, because any draws would reduce the number of wins and therefore the total number of points awarded.
* If the highest score is less than or equal to the sum of the two lower scores, it means that the player with the highest score could have drawn all of their games against the other two players. In this case, the maximum number of draws is equal to the total number of points awarded minus the maximum possible number of wins.

Overall, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
