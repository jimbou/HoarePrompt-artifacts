Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends. The logic is as follows:

- If the total score of the three friends is odd, it is impossible to achieve this score through any combination of wins, losses, and draws, so the program prints -1.
- Otherwise, the program calculates the maximum number of draws by subtracting the maximum possible number of wins (which is the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores) from the total score, and then dividing the result by 2.

This logic is correct because each draw contributes 2 points to the total score, and each win contributes 2 points to the winner's score and 0 points to the loser's score. By subtracting the maximum possible number of wins from the total score, we are left with the maximum possible number of draws.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where no games were played (in which case the total score is 0 and the program prints 0), and the case where the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results (in which case the program prints -1).
