Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in the list `v`.
3. The program then checks if the sum of the three integers is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the sum of the scores must be even (each game contributes 2 points to the total sum). This is a correct check.
4. If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. The calculation is based on the fact that the maximum number of draws occurs when the difference between the highest and lowest scores is minimized. The formula used is correct: `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
5. The program prints the calculated result for each test case.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the sum of the scores is odd, and the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games and results.

Correctness: **True**
