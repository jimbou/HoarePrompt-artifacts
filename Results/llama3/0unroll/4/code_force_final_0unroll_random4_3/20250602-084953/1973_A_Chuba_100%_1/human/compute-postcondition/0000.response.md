The code accepts an integer input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with three integers. After accepting the integer input for `t`, the stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with three integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each with three integers.**
