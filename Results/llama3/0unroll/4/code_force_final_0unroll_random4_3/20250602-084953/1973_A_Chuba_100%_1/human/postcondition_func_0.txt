This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It calculates and prints the result for each test case, which is either '-1' if the sum of the scores is odd, or a calculated value if the sum is even. The function does not modify the input values or any external state, and its output is solely based on the input test cases.
