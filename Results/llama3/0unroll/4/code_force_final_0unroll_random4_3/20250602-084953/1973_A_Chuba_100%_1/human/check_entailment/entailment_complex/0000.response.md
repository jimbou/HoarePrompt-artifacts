Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of the three players.
3. The program checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to achieve an odd sum with integer scores. This is correct because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game contributes either 2 or 0 points to the sum.
4. If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened. The formula used is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula is correct because it subtracts the maximum possible number of wins (i.e., `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]`) from the total sum of scores, and then divides the result by 2 to get the number of draws.
5. The program prints the calculated result for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
