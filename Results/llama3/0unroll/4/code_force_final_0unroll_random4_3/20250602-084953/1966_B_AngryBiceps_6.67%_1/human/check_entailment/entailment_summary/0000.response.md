Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make all squares in a grid the same color by performing any number of operations. The program checks each grid for a valid configuration, printing 'YES' if the configuration is valid and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is based on the idea that if the first and last rows are the same, or the first column and last column are the same, then it is possible to make all squares the same color. This is because the operations allowed in the problem can be used to color all squares in a subrectangle between two squares of the same color.

However, the program's implementation has a flaw. It only checks if the first row and last row are the same, or if the first column and last column are the same. It does not check if there are any other valid configurations.

For example, consider the following grid:

WWWWBW
WBWWWW
BBBWWW
BWWWBB
WWBWBB
BBBWBW

In this grid, the first and last rows are not the same, and the first and last columns are not the same. However, it is still possible to make all squares the same color by performing a series of operations.

Therefore, the program's logic is incomplete, and it may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
