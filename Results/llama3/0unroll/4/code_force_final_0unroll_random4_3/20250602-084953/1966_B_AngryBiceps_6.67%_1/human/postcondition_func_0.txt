This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. It checks each grid for a valid configuration, printing 'YES' if the configuration is valid and 'NO' otherwise. A valid configuration is one where either the first and last rows are the same, or the first column and last column are the same. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results in the same order they were input.
