Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the first row and the last row have the same color, but the first column and the last column have different colors. In this case, the program will print 'YES', but it is actually not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

For example, consider the following input:

3 3
BBB
WBW
BBB

In this case, the first row and the last row have the same color 'B', but the first column and the last column have different colors 'B' and 'W'. The program will print 'YES', but it is actually not possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

The program only checks if the first row and the last row have the same color, or if the first column and the last column have the same color. It does not check if the first row and the last row have the same color and the first column and the last column have the same color. Therefore, it does not cover all possible cases and is incorrect.
