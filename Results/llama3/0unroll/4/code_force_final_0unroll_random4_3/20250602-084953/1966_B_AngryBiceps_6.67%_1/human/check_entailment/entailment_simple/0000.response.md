Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first row, last row, first column, and last column of the grid have the same color. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just operations that involve the first or last row or column. Therefore, the program's conditions are not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are different colors, but there is a row in the middle that is the same color as the first row. In this case, it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by selecting the middle row and the first row, and then selecting the middle row and the last row. However, the program would incorrectly print 'NO' in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
