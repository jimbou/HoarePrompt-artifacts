Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if the first row, last row, first column, and last column of the grid have the same color. If they do, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

However, this approach is incorrect. The problem statement allows for any number of operations, not just one. Therefore, it's possible to make all squares the same color even if the first row, last row, first column, and last column don't have the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

WWWWWW
WBWBWB
WBWBWB
WBWBWB
WWWWWW

The first row and last row have the same color (W), but the first column and last column don't. However, it's still possible to make all squares the same color by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners and coloring all squares in between white.

The correct approach would be to check if there is at least one row or one column that has the same color. If there is, then it's possible to make all squares the same color.

Correctness: **False**
