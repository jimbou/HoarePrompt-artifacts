Output State: **stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0), I is a function that takes no arguments and returns a list of integers from stdin, R is a function that takes no arguments and returns an integer from stdin**.

The code defines two lambda functions, `I` and `R`, which are used to read input from stdin. The `I` function reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers using the space character as a delimiter, and returns the list. The `R` function reads a single integer from stdin and returns it. The code does not modify the value of the input in stdin, so it remains unchanged. The functions `I` and `R` are defined but not called, so they do not affect the state of the program.
