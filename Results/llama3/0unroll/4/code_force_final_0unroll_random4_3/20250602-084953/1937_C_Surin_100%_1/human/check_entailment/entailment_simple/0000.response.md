Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the index `v1` of the maximum value in the permutation `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done using the query `? v1 v1 v2 v2` and updating `v1` if the result is `<`.

2. Once the maximum value is found, the program finds the index `prev` of the minimum value in the permutation `p` that has the maximum XOR with `v1`. This is done by comparing each element with `v1` using the query `? v1 i v1 prev` and updating `prev` if the result is `>` or if the result is `=` and the query `? i i prev prev` returns `<`.

3. Finally, the program prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes the XOR.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are also correctly formatted and the output is correctly printed.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
