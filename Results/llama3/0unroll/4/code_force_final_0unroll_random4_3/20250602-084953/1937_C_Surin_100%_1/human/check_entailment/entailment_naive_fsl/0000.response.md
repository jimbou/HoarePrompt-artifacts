Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first finds the index `v1` of the maximum value in the permutation `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done using the `?` queries to compare the bitwise OR of two elements.

2. Once the maximum value `v1` is found, the program then finds the index `prev` of the minimum value in the permutation `p` that has the maximum XOR with `v1`. This is done by comparing each element with the current minimum using the `?` queries to compare the bitwise OR of two elements.

3. The program then prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the answer.

The program handles all potential cases because it correctly finds the maximum value `v1` and the minimum value `prev` that has the maximum XOR with `v1`. The program also uses the `?` queries correctly to compare the bitwise OR of two elements.

The program also follows the problem description by using at most 3n queries, where n is the length of the permutation `p`. The program uses n queries to find the maximum value `v1` and at most 2n queries to find the minimum value `prev` that has the maximum XOR with `v1`.

Therefore, the program is correct and handles all potential cases.
