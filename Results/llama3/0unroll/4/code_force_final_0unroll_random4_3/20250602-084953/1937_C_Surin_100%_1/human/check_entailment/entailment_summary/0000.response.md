Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality of finding any two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The program uses a series of queries to find the maximum and second maximum values in a range from 1 to 'n', and then prints the indices of these maximum and second maximum values. The program repeats this process for each test case, updating the output state after each iteration.

Correctness: **True**
