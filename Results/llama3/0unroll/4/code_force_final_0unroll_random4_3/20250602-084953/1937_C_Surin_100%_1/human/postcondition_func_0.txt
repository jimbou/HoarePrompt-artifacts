The function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer 'n' and performs a series of queries to find the maximum and second maximum values in a range from 1 to 'n'. It then prints the indices of these maximum and second maximum values. The function repeats this process for each test case, updating the output state after each iteration.
