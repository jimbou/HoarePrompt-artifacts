This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers t, n, and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of the array elements after applying certain operations, which involve sorting the array, subtracting twice the value of the first x elements, and then adding the value of the first k elements and subtracting twice the value of the elements at index k+x. The function repeats this process for each test case and prints the maximum sum for each case.
