stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, k <= n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 1000). The number of test cases is given in the first line of the input.
