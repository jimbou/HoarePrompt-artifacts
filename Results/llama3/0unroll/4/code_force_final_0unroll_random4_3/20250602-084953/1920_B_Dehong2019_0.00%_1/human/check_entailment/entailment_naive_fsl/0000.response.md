Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of elements in the array is less than or equal to the limit on the number of elements that Alice can remove. In this case, Alice can remove all elements from the array, and the sum of elements after the game should be 0. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is:

1 1 1
1

The program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 0, because Alice can remove the only element from the array, and the sum of elements after the game is 0.

The program also does not handle the case when the limit on the number of elements that Bob can multiply by -1 is 0. In this case, Bob cannot multiply any elements by -1, and the sum of elements after the game should be the same as the sum of elements before the game. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, if the input is:

1 1 0
1

The program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, because Bob cannot multiply any elements by -1, and the sum of elements after the game is the same as the sum of elements before the game.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
