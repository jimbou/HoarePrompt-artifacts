Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= n). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 1000).**
