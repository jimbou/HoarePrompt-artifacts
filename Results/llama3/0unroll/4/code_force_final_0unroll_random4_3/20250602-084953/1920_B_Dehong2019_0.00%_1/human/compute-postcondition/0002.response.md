Output State: The loop has executed t times, and for each execution, it has read two lines from the standard input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The loop has calculated and printed the maximum possible sum of the array elements after applying the given operations. The values of t, n, k, x, and a_i have been used and modified within the loop, but their initial values are no longer accessible. The standard input has been consumed by the loop, and its state has been modified.
