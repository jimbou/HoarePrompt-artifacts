Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the final score of the game if both players play optimally.

The program uses a Counter to count the frequency of each number in the array. It then iterates over the range from 0 to n (inclusive) and checks if the current number is not in the Counter or if its frequency is 1 and it's the second occurrence of a number with frequency 1. If either condition is met, it prints the current number as the final score and breaks the loop.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. It correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or the smallest non-negative integer that occurs only once in the array, which is the definition of the MEX.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
