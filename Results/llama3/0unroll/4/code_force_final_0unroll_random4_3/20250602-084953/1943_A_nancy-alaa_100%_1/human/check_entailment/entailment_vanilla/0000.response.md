Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.

3. It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the array.

4. The program then iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array or is present only once.

5. If it finds an integer that is not present in the array, it prints that integer as the MEX and breaks the loop.

6. If it finds an integer that is present only once in the array, it checks if it's the second occurrence of such an integer. If it is, it prints that integer as the MEX and breaks the loop.

7. The program repeats this process for each test case.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score. By choosing the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array or is present only once, Alice ensures that the MEX of her array is maximized. Bob's strategy is to remove the smallest non-negative integer that is present in the array, which minimizes the MEX.

However, there is a small mistake in the program. The variable `first` is used to track if it's the first occurrence of an integer with a count of 1. But the variable `first` is not reset to `False` for each test case. This means that once `first` is set to `True` in a test case, it will remain `True` for all subsequent test cases, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the variable `first` should be reset to `False` at the beginning of each test case.

Correctness: **False**
