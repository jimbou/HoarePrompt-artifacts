Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array using a Counter. Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to n (inclusive) and checks if the current number is not in the Counter or if it appears only once in the array and it's not the first occurrence of a number that appears only once.

If the current number is not in the Counter, it means that Alice can choose this number and Bob cannot choose it, so the score will be this number. If the current number appears only once in the array and it's not the first occurrence of a number that appears only once, it means that Alice can choose this number and Bob can choose the first occurrence of a number that appears only once, so the score will be this number.

If no such number is found, it means that all numbers from 0 to n appear at least twice in the array, so the score will be n + 1.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
