Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with three integers n, a, and b, representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. The values of n, a, and b are still within the range of 1 to 10^9.
