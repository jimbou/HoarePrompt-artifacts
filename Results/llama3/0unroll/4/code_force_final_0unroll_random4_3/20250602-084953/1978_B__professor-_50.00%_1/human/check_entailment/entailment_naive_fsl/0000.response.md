Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when `b - a` is odd. In this case, the formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` will not give the correct result because it performs integer division, which truncates the result to an integer.

For example, when `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`, the program will print `45`, but the correct result is `45 + 5 = 50`. This is because the formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` evaluates to `30`, which is incorrect because `b - a` is odd.

To fix this issue, the program should use floating-point division instead of integer division, or it should handle the case where `b - a` is odd separately.
