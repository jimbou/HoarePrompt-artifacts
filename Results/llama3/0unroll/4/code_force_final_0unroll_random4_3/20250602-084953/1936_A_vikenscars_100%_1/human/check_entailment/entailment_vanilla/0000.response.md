Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the interactive problem described. It uses two functions: `func_1` to send a query and receive the result, and `func_2` to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. `func_1` takes four indices as input, constructs a query string, prints it, and returns the result of the query.

2. `func_2` takes the number of elements `n` as input and initializes `max_item_idx` to 0. It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`, comparing the current `max_item_idx` with each index `i`. If the result of the query is '<', it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`. This effectively finds the index with the maximum value.

3. After finding the maximum value, it initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx` and iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it sends a query to compare the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` with the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` and `i`. If the result is '<', it updates `pair_idx` to `i`. If the result is '=', it sends another query to compare the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` and `pair_idx` with the bitwise OR of `i` and `i`. If the result is '>', it updates `pair_idx` to `i`. This effectively finds the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

4. Finally, it prints the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
