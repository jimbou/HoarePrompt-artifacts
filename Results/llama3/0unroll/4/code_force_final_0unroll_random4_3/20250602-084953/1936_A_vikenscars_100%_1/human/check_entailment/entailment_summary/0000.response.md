Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices i and j in a secret sequence p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a comparison function func_1 to ask queries and determine the maximum item in the sequence.

The program first finds the index of the maximum item in the range [0, n) using func_1. It then finds another index of the maximum item in the same range by comparing the maximum item with each item in the range. If a comparison returns '<', it updates the pair index. If a comparison returns '=', it further compares the pair index with the current item to determine the maximum item.

The program prints the indices of the two maximum items, which are the indices i and j that maximize p_i XOR p_j.

The program meets the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. It uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
