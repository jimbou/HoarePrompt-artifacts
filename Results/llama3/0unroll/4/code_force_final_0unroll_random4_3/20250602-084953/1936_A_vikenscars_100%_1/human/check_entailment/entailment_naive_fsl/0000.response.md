Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. 

The program first finds the index of the maximum item in the permutation using function `func_2`. This is done by comparing each item with the current maximum item and updating the maximum item index if a larger item is found.

Once the maximum item index is found, the program then finds the index of the item that has the maximum XOR value with the maximum item. This is done by comparing the XOR of the maximum item with each other item and updating the pair index if a larger XOR value is found.

The program uses the `func_1` function to ask queries and get the results of the comparisons. The `func_1` function takes four indices as input, prints the query, and returns the result of the comparison.

The program handles all potential cases because it checks all items in the permutation to find the maximum item and the item with the maximum XOR value. It also handles the case where there are multiple items with the same maximum XOR value by choosing the first one it finds.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all inputs.
