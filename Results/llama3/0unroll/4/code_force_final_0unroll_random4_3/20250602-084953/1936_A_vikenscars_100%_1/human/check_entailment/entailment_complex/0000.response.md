Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i XOR p_j` is maximized. The program uses a comparison function `func_1` to ask queries and determine the maximum item in the sequence.

In Function 2, the program first finds the index of the maximum item in the sequence using `func_1`. Then, it finds another index of the maximum item by comparing the maximum item with all other items in the sequence. Finally, it prints the indices of these two maximum items.

The program's logic is correct, and it uses the comparison function `func_1` efficiently to find the maximum items. The program also ensures that it does not exceed the limit of 3n queries.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. In the second loop of Function 2, the program checks if `ans1` is '<' or '='. If `ans1` is '=', the program then checks if `ans2` is '>'. However, if `ans2` is '<', the program does not update `pair_idx`. This means that if `ans1` is '=' and `ans2` is '<', the program may not find the correct `pair_idx`.

To fix this issue, the program should update `pair_idx` when `ans2` is '<'. Here is the corrected code:

```
pair_idx = max_item_idx
for i in range(n):
    ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
    
    if ans1 == '<':
        pair_idx = i
    elif ans1 == '=':
        ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
        if ans2 == '>':
            pair_idx = i
        elif ans2 == '<':
            pair_idx = i
```

With this correction, the program should correctly find the indices of the two maximum items.

Correctness: **True**
