Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the function `func_2`. The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3` is hardcoded, which means that the function will return 0 for this specific case, regardless of the actual elements in the array. This is not in line with the problem description, which states that the function should return the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally.

For example, if the input is `n = 6, k = 6, x = 3` and the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the function will return 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be the maximum sum that can be achieved by removing at most 6 elements and multiplying at most 3 elements by -1.

The correct implementation should consider all possible cases and return the maximum sum that can be achieved by both players playing optimally.
