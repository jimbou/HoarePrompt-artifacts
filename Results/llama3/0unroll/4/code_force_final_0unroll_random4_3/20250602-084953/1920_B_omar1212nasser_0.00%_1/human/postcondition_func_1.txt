This function calculates the maximum difference between the sum of all elements in a sorted list and twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements, considering 'removals' number of elements from the end of the list. It returns 0 if 'removals' is 6 and 'negatives' is 3; otherwise, it returns the maximum difference value. The function takes three parameters: 'removals', 'negatives', and 'elements', and returns an integer value.
