Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n`, the limit on the number of elements Alice can remove `k`, and the limit on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1 `x`.

3. It then reads the `n` elements of the array and sorts them in ascending order.

4. The program then calls the function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.

5. In `func_2`, it first checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3. If this condition is true, it returns 0. This is likely a special case to handle a specific scenario.

6. It then initializes an empty list `pos` to store the possible sums after Alice's and Bob's moves.

7. It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array and the sum `n` of the last `x` elements (which will be multiplied by -1 by Bob).

8. It appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the last `x` elements to the `pos` list. This represents the sum after Bob's move.

9. It then iterates from 1 to `k` (the number of elements Alice can remove). In each iteration, it subtracts the current last element from the sum `s` and updates the sum `n` by adding the next element (if it exists) and subtracting the current last element.

10. It appends the updated sum `s` minus twice the updated sum `n` to the `pos` list. This represents the sum after Alice's move and Bob's move.

11. Finally, it returns the maximum sum from the `pos` list, which represents the maximum sum that can be achieved after both players' moves.

12. The main function `func_1` prints the result of `func_2` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
