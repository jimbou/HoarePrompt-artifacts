stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and x, where n is the number of elements in the array, k is the limit on the number of elements that Alice can remove, and x is the limit on the number of elements that Bob can multiply by -1. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, which are the elements of the array.
