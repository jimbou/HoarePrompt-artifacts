#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, each less than 2^31.
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, each less than 2^31, res is the number of unique integers in a, count is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in a and the values are all 0.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in list 'a', where 'a' contains 'n' non-negative integers, each less than 2^31.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers and returns the number of unique integers in the list. The function does not modify the input list. It counts the unique integers by creating a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers and the values are all 0. The function then returns the number of keys in the dictionary, which represents the number of unique integers in the input list.
