Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers and returns the number of unique integers in the list. The function does not modify the input list. It counts the unique integers by creating a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers and the values are all 0. The function then returns the number of keys in the dictionary, which represents the number of unique integers in the input list.**
