Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^3. The stdin now contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k, where n is between 1 and 100, and k is between 0 and n*(n-1)/2.
