The function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k. It then prints t lines, each containing either 1 or n-1, depending on whether k is greater than or equal to n-1. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints n-1. The function does not modify the input values and only prints the calculated values to standard output.
