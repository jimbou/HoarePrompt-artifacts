Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with a certain number of cubes after a given number of moves. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes.

The program checks three conditions:

1. If the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, it prints 'YES'.
2. If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it prints 'NO'.
3. If the number of test cases and the number of moves have the same parity (both odd or both even), it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` checks whether the number of test cases and the number of moves have the same parity, but this is not relevant to the problem. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`, which checks whether the number of moves and the desired number of cubes have the same parity.

Since the number of moves and the desired number of cubes must have the same parity for it to be possible to build the tower, the correct program should print 'Yes' if `b % 2 == c % 2` and 'No' otherwise.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
