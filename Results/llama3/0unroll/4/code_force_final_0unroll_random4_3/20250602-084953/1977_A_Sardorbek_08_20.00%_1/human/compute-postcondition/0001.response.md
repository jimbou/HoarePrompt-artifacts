Output State: The loop will execute 'a' times, where 'a' is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. In each iteration, it will read two integers 'b' and 'c' from the standard input, and print 'YES' if 'b' equals 'c', 'NO' if 'b' is less than 'c', 'Yes' if 'a' and 'b' have the same parity, and 'No' otherwise. The output will be a sequence of 'a' lines, each containing either 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The values of 'a', 'b', and 'c' will be updated in each iteration, but their initial values will be lost after the loop finishes.
