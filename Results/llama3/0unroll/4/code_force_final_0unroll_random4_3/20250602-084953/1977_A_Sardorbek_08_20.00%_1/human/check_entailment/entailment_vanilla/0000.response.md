Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking the following conditions:

1. If the number of moves (b) is equal to the number of cubes (c), it prints 'YES'.
2. If the number of moves (b) is less than the number of cubes (c), it prints 'NO'.
3. If the number of moves (b) is greater than the number of cubes (c), it checks if the parity of the number of moves (b) is the same as the parity of the number of test cases (a). If they are the same, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.

However, there are a few issues with this program:

* The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect. The parity of the number of test cases (a) is irrelevant to the problem. Instead, the program should check if the parity of the number of moves (b) is the same as the parity of the number of cubes (c).
* The program does not handle the case where the number of moves (b) is greater than the number of cubes (c) and the parity of b and c is different. In this case, the program should print 'No'.

Correctness: **False**
