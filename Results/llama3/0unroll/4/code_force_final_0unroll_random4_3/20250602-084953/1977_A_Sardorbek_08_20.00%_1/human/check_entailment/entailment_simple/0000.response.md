Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves. The program reads the number of test cases (t) and then for each test case, it reads two integers n and m.

The program then checks the following conditions:

1. If n equals m, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can build a tower with exactly m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n times.

2. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves he makes.

3. If n and m have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can build a tower with exactly m cubes by putting 1 cube on top of the tower n times, and then removing or adding cubes as needed to reach the desired height.

4. If n and m do not have the same parity, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot build a tower with an odd number of cubes if he makes an even number of moves, and vice versa.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles all possible cases and prints the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
