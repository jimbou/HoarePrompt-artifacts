Functionality: **This function reads an integer 't' from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads two integers 'n' and 'm'. It then checks the conditions: if 'n' equals 'm', it prints 'YES'; if 'n' is less than 'm', it prints 'NO'; if 't' and 'n' have the same parity (both odd or both even), it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
