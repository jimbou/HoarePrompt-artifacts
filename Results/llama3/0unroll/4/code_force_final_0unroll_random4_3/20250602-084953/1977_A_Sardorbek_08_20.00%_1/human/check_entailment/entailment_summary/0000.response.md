Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of moves `n`. The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` to check if the number of moves `b` and the number of cubes `c` have the same parity.

Additionally, the program prints 'Yes' and 'No' with different capitalization, which may not be consistent with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
