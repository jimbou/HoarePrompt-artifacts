Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1 to. The second line contains a space-separated list of integers representing the elements of the array. The number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1 to are all positive integers. The elements of the array are positive integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
