This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an array of positive integers and two limits for operations that can be performed on the array. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array elements after applying the operations, which involve removing elements and multiplying some elements by -1, within the given limits. The function then prints the maximum possible sum for each test case.
