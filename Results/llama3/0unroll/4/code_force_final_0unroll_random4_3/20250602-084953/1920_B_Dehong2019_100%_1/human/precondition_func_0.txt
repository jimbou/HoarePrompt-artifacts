stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1 to. The second line contains a space-separated list of integers representing the elements of the array. The number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove, and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1 to are all positive integers. The elements of the array are positive integers.
