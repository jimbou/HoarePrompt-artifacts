This function reads a series of input lines from standard input, where each line contains three digits. It then classifies each set of digits as 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on their relative values and prints out the classification for each set. The function does not return any value or modify any external state, but instead, produces output directly to the console.
