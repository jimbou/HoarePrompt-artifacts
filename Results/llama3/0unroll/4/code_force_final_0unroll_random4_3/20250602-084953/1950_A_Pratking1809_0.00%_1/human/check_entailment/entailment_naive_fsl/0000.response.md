Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where the input is 3 2 1. According to the problem description, this should output "NONE", but the program outputs nothing because the condition for "NONE" is only checked if the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are not met, and the condition for "PEAK" is met (a < b > c is True). However, the condition for "PEAK" is not sufficient to determine if the digits form a peak, because it does not check if a > c. Therefore, the program incorrectly identifies 3 2 1 as a peak.

The correct condition for "PEAK" should be a < b and b > c. The correct condition for "NONE" should be checked regardless of the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK". 

Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```
