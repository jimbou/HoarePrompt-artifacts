Output State: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where the elements from index left to left + mid - 1 are small_element + mid - 1, small_element + mid - 2, ..., small_element + 1, small_element, cliquess is a list of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1 where the elements from index left to left + mid - 1 are clique, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2)
