This function generates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each containing `n` integers, where the value at each index is equal to the ceiling of the index divided by `k` plus 1. It then prints these lists, as well as the number of cliques (`cliques`). The function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. The function does not return any values, but rather prints the results directly.
