Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cliques required to partition the graph. The formula `cliques = ceil(n / k)` is correct, as it ensures that each clique has at most `k` vertices.

2. The program correctly assigns integers to each vertex. The `make_array` function is called for each clique, and it assigns consecutive integers to the vertices in that clique. The integers are assigned in a way that minimizes the number of cliques required.

3. The program correctly prints the assigned integers and the partition of the graph into cliques. The `print(*arr)` statement prints the assigned integers, and the `print(cliques)` statement prints the number of cliques. The `print(*cliquess)` statement prints the partition of the graph into cliques.

4. The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` is equal to `k`, the program correctly assigns all vertices to a single clique.

5. The program has a time complexity of O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
