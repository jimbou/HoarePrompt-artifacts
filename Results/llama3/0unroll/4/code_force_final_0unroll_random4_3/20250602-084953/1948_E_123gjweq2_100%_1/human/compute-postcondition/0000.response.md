Output State: **left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr and cliquess are lists of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1, small_element is left + 1, big_element is right + 1, mid is (right - left + 1) // 2, not_mid is right - left + 1 - ((right - left + 1) // 2)**

The code calculates the values of `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` based on the initial values of `left` and `right`. The values of `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess` remain unchanged. The final state includes the initial conditions for `left`, `right`, `clique`, `arr`, and `cliquess`, as well as the newly calculated values for `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`.
