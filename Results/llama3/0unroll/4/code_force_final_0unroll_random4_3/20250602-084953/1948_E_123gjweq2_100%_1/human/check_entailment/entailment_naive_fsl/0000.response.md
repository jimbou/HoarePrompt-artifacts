Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem, where the goal is to assign distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. The program uses a greedy approach to assign integers to vertices and then partitions the graph into cliques.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required and initializes arrays to store the assigned integers and clique assignments. The `make_array` function assigns integers to vertices in a way that minimizes the number of cliques required.

The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It correctly assigns distinct integers to vertices, partitions the graph into cliques, and prints the assigned integers and clique assignments.

The program's approach is correct because it ensures that each vertex is assigned an integer that minimizes the number of cliques required. The `make_array` function assigns integers in a way that creates a clique for every `k` vertices, which is the minimum number of cliques required.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` is a multiple of `k`, in which case the number of cliques required is `n/k`.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case.
