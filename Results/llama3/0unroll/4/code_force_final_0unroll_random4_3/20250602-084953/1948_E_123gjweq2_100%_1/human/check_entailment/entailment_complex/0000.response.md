Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a set of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required and initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers for each vertex, respectively. It then calls the `make_array` function to fill these lists.

The `make_array` function takes a range of indices and a clique number as input and assigns integers to the vertices in that range such that they form a clique. It fills the `arr` list with consecutive integers and the `cliquess` list with the clique number.

The program prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique numbers for each vertex.

Based on the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the number of cliques, assigns integers to vertices, and partitions the graph into cliques.

Correctness: **True**
