Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: arr is a list of n integers where the value at each index is equal to the ceiling of the index divided by k plus 1, cliquess is a list of n integers where the value at each index is equal to the ceiling of the index divided by k plus 1.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: [ceiling(index/k) + 1 for index in range(n)]
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: a list of n integers where the value at each index is equal to the ceiling of the index divided by k plus 1
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: the elements of the list cliquess (where each element is the ceiling of the index divided by k plus 1)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, each containing `n` integers, where the value at each index is equal to the ceiling of the index divided by `k` plus 1. It then prints these lists, as well as the number of cliques (`cliques`). The function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. The function does not return any values, but rather prints the results directly.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left < right, clique is a non-negative integer, arr and cliquess are lists of non-negative integers with length at least right + 1.
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The elements of the list arr from index left + mid - 1 to left - 1 are filled with consecutive integers from small_element to small_element + mid - 1. The elements of the list cliquess from index left to left + mid - 1 are filled with the value of clique.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The elements of the list arr from index left + mid - 1 to left - 1 are filled with consecutive integers from small_element to small_element + mid - 1. The elements of the list cliquess from index left to left + mid - 1 are filled with the value of clique. The elements of the list arr from index left + mid to left + mid + not_mid - 1 are filled with consecutive integers from big_element - not_mid + 1 to big_element. The elements of the list cliquess from index left + mid to left + mid + not_mid - 1 are filled with the value of clique.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function fills two lists, arr and cliquess, with specific values within a specified range. It takes in parameters left, right, clique, arr, and cliquess. The function first calculates mid and not_mid values based on the left and right parameters. It then fills the arr list with consecutive integers from small_element to small_element + mid - 1 and from big_element - not_mid + 1 to big_element, while filling the corresponding cliquess list with the value of clique. The function modifies the input lists arr and cliquess in place, without returning any values.
