Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to each vertex in a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. `func_1` calculates the number of cliques required and initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique numbers, respectively. It then calls `make_array` to fill these lists.

`make_array` is responsible for assigning integers to the vertices within a specified range. It calculates the midpoint of the range and assigns consecutive integers to the vertices on either side of the midpoint. The clique number is also assigned to the corresponding vertices.

The program's correctness can be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.  The program correctly calculates the number of cliques required, which is the ceiling of `n` divided by `k`.
2.  The program assigns distinct integers to each vertex, as required.
3.  The program ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques by assigning clique numbers to the vertices.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program meets all these criteria. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
