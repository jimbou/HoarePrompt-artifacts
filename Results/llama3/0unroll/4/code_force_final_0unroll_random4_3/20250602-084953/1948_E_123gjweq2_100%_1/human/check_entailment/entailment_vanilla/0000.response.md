Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a graph partitioning problem. The goal is to assign distinct integers to each vertex of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `make_array`. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques required based on the input parameters `n` and `k`. It then initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and clique assignments for each vertex, respectively.

The `make_array` function is used to assign integers to each clique. It takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. The `left` and `right` parameters represent the range of vertices in the current clique, and `clique` is the clique number.

The `make_array` function assigns integers to the vertices in the clique in a specific order. It first assigns the smallest possible integers to the vertices in the first half of the clique, and then assigns the largest possible integers to the vertices in the second half of the clique. This is done to minimize the number of cliques required.

The program then prints the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments for each vertex.

Based on the provided problem description and the program's logic, it appears that the program is correct. The program correctly calculates the number of cliques required and assigns integers to each vertex in a way that minimizes the number of cliques.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are not defined as global variables, but they are accessed and modified within the `make_array` function. This can cause issues if the program is run in a environment where global variables are not allowed.

To fix this issue, the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays can be passed as parameters to the `make_array` function, or they can be defined as global variables within the `func_1` function.

Correctness: **True**
