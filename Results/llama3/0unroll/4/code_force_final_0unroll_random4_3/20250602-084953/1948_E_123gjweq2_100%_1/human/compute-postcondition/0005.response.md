Functionality: **The function fills two lists, arr and cliquess, with specific values within a specified range. It takes in parameters left, right, clique, arr, and cliquess. The function first calculates mid and not_mid values based on the left and right parameters. It then fills the arr list with consecutive integers from small_element to small_element + mid - 1 and from big_element - not_mid + 1 to big_element, while filling the corresponding cliquess list with the value of clique. The function modifies the input lists arr and cliquess in place, without returning any values.**
