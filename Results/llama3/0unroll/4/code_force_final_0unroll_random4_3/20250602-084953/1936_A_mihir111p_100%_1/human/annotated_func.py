#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is a positive integer.
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    #This is printed: ? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n)
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that starts with '?' and is followed by the values of a, b, c, and d, which are non-negative integers less than a positive integer n.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes four non-negative integers a, b, c, and d as input, prints a query string with these values, and returns a string that starts with '?' and is followed by the same values of a, b, c, and d. The function does not modify the input values.
