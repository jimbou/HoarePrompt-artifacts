Based on the initial state, the variables a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is a positive integer.

The print statement is: `print('?', a, b, c, d)`

This statement will print a string that starts with '?' followed by the values of a, b, c, and d.

Since a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n, their values can be any integer from 0 to n-1.

Therefore, the output will be a string that starts with '?' followed by four non-negative integers, each less than n.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n)**
