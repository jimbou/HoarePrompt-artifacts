Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i XOR p_j` is maximized. The program uses a query function `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the sequence.

The program first finds the index `ans1` of the maximum element in the sequence by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the index `mx` of the maximum element that is not equal to `ans1` by comparing each element with `ans1`. The program then finds the index `ans` of the maximum element among the elements that are equal to `mx`.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are used to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements, which is a valid operation according to the problem description.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to find the correct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i XOR p_j` is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
