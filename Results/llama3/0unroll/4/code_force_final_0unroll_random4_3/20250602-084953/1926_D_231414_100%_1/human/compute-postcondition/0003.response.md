Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then processes these integers by performing bitwise XOR operations with a predefined constant (2^31 - 1), and keeps track of the results in a dictionary. The function outputs the number of unique results obtained after processing all integers in each test case.**
