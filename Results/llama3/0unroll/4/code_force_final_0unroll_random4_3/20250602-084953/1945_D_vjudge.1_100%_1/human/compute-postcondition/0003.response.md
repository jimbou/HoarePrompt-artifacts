Output State: **`suff` is a list of n+1 integers such that suff[i] = sum(c[j] for j in range(i, n)) for all i, `ans` is positive infinity.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to positive infinity, while the value of `suff` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `suff` still contains n+1 integers, where each integer at index `i` is the sum of all integers in the list `c` from index `i` to `n`.
