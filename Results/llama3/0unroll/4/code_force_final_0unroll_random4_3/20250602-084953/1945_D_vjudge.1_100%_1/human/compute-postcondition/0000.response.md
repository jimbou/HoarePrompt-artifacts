Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200000, a and b are lists of n integers such that 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9 for all i, c is a list of n integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 10^9 for all i, suff is a list of n+1 zeros**.

The code creates a new list `c` by taking the minimum value between corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. This means that for each index `i`, `c[i]` will be the smaller of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `a` and `b` contain integers between 1 and 10^9, `c` will also contain integers in this range.

The second line creates a new list `suff` with `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0. This list is not modified further in the given code snippet, so it remains a list of `n+1` zeros.
