Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first m people in line.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue n and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill m. It then reads the values of a_i and b_i for each person in the queue.

3. The program defines a function func_1 that takes n, m, a, and b as input. This function calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

4. Inside func_1, it calculates an array c where c[i] is the minimum of a_i and b_i. This is because Kirill can choose to either pay a_i to the person at position i or pay b_i to each person from position j to i.

5. It then calculates the suffix sum array suff where suff[i] is the sum of c[j] for all j from i to n-1. This represents the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend if he wants to be at position i.

6. The program then iterates over the first m positions and calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be at each position. It does this by adding the cost of reaching the current position (a[i]) to the suffix sum from the next position (suff[i + 1]).

7. Finally, it prints the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
