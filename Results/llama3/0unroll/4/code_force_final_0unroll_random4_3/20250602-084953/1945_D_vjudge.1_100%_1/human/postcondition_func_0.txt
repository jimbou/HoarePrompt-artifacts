This function calculates and returns the minimum sum of a[i] and the sum of the minimum values of pairs (a[j], b[j]) for j in the range [i+1, n), where i ranges from 0 to k-1. It takes as input two lists a and b of n integers, and an integer k, and returns the minimum sum found. The function assumes that 1 <= k <= n <= 200000 and 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9 for all i.
