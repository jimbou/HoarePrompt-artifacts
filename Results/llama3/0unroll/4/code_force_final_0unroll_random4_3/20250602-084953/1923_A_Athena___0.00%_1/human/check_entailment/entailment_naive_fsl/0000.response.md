Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. The issue lies in the fact that the program simply counts the number of zeros in the array after removing leading and trailing zeros. This approach does not take into account the actual positions of the chips and the free cells.

For example, consider the input:

5
1 0 1 0 1

The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 3. The correct sequence of operations would be:

1. Move the chip in the third cell to the second cell.
2. Move the chip in the fifth cell to the third cell.
3. Move the chip in the fifth cell to the fourth cell.

The program's approach does not consider the fact that the chips need to be moved to the closest free cell to the left, and it does not account for the fact that the chips can be moved in any order. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
