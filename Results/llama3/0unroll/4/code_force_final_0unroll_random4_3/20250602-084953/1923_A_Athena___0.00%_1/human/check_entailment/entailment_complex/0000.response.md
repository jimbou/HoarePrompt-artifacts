Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input test cases and processes each case individually.
2. For each test case, it removes leading and trailing zeros from the list of integers, which is a necessary step to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
3. After removing leading and trailing zeros, the program correctly counts the number of zeros in the modified list, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
4. The program prints the count of zeros for each test case, which is the desired output.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
