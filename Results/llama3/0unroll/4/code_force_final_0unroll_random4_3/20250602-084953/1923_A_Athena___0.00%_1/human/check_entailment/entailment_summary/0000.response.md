Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case by removing leading and trailing zeros, and then counts the number of zeros in the modified list. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
