Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 50). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1). At least one a_i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin contains t-1 test cases because one test case has been read and processed. Each test case still contains two lines, with the first line containing an integer n between 2 and 50, and the second line containing n integers between 0 and 1, with at least one of them being 1.
