This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers (0s and 1s). It then processes each test case by removing leading and trailing zeros from the list, prints the modified list, and finally prints the count of zeros in the modified list. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input.
