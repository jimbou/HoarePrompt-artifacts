Output State: **a is a list of integers from 1 to the input number, with every other element reversed, stdin contains a list of integers (the length of the permutations).**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified to contain integers from 1 to the input number, with every other element reversed. The stdin still contains a list of integers, which are the lengths of the permutations. The input number, which was used to generate the list `a`, is no longer present in the stdin.
