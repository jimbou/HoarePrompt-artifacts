Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it not beautiful. The program iterates through the array, counting the consecutive occurrences of each number. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found so far.

The program correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are equal, in which case it outputs -1, as it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only considers the minimum count of consecutive equal elements, but it does not consider the actual numbers being equal. In the problem statement, it is mentioned that the array can be made not beautiful by replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are equal. Therefore, the program should also consider the case where the minimum count of consecutive equal elements is 1, but the adjacent elements are equal.

For example, in the test case [1, 2, 1, 2, 1], the program outputs 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2, because removing the first and last elements would make the array not beautiful.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.

Correctness: **False**
