Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. The program iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive occurrences of the same number. It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive occurrences seen so far.

The program correctly handles the case where the array consists of identical numbers, in which case it is impossible to make it stop being beautiful by removing elements. In this case, the program outputs -1.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array has at least two different numbers. In this case, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the same number and outputs this count as the minimum number of elements that need to be removed.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program increments the index `i` twice in the while loop, which causes it to skip some elements in the array. This can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
