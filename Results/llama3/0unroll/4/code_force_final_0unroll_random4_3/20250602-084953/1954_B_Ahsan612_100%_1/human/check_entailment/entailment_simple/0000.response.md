Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by replacing an element with its adjacent elements if they are the same.

The program works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements. It does this by maintaining a variable `same` that increments whenever it encounters an element that is the same as the previous one, and resets whenever it encounters a different element. It also keeps track of the minimum length of such sequences seen so far in the variable `minn`.

After iterating through the entire array, it checks if the minimum length of consecutive equal elements is either infinity (which means all elements in the array are the same) or equal to the length of the array (which means the array is already not beautiful). If either of these conditions is true, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive equal elements, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
