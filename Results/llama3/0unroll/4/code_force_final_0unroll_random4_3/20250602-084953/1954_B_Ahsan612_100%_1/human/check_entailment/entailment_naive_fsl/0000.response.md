Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input array has only two distinct elements, and they are alternating. For example, the input [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] should return 1, but the program returns -1.

The issue is that the program only checks for sequences of the same number, but it does not consider the case when the numbers are alternating. To fix this, the program should also check for alternating sequences and update the minimum count accordingly.

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look like:
```
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            # Check for alternating sequences
            alt = 1
            for i in range(1, len(ar)):
                if ar[i] != ar[i-1]:
                    alt += 1
                else:
                    break
            if alt == len(ar):
                print(1)
            else:
                print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```
This corrected code checks for alternating sequences and returns 1 if the input array has only two distinct elements and they are alternating.
