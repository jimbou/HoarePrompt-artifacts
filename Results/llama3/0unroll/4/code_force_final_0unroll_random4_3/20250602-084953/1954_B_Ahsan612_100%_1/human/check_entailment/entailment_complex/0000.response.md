Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of consecutive equal elements in a list of integers. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program initializes `same` to 1, which represents the count of consecutive equal elements. It also initializes `num` to the first element of the list, which is the current number being compared.

2. The program then iterates through the list, incrementing `same` whenever it encounters the same number (`ar[i] == num`). When it encounters a different number, it updates `minn` with the minimum count of consecutive equal elements seen so far and resets `same` to 1.

3. After the loop, the program updates `minn` one more time with the count of consecutive equal elements for the last sequence of equal numbers.

4. Finally, the program checks if `minn` is equal to infinity or the length of the list. If it is, that means all elements in the list are equal, so it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count of consecutive equal elements.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when all elements in the list are equal or when the list contains only one element.

Correctness: **True**
