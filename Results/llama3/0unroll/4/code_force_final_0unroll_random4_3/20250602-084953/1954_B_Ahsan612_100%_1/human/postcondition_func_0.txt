This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then analyzes each list to find the minimum number of consecutive equal elements. If all elements in the list are equal, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case on a separate line.
