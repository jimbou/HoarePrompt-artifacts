Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves on 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. The move involves choosing two integers x and y, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The given program sorts the 2n integers in ascending order and then calculates the sum of every other integer starting from the first one (i.e., A[::2]). This approach ensures that the minimum of each pair of integers is added to the score, which maximizes the final score.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the input integers.

Since the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for achieving the maximum final score, it produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
