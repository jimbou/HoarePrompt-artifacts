Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order and then sums up every other integer starting from the first one (i.e., the smallest integers). This approach ensures that the minimum value is added to the score in each move, thus maximizing the final score.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where n is 1 or where all integers are the same. The use of the `sort()` function ensures that the list is sorted correctly, and the slicing operation `A[::2]` correctly selects every other integer starting from the first one.

The program also handles the input and output correctly, reading the number of test cases and the integers for each test case, and printing the maximum final score for each test case.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
