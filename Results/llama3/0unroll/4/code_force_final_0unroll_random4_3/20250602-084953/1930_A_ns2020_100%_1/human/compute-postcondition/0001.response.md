Output State: **The sum of the smallest n numbers in each test case is printed, and t is 0.**

In this output state, the loop has executed all the iterations, and for each test case, the sum of the smallest n numbers (which are the numbers at even indices after sorting) is printed. The variable t is now 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The state of the other variables, such as the input test cases, remains unchanged.
