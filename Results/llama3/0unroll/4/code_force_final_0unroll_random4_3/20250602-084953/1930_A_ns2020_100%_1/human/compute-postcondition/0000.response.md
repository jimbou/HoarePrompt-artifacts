Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= 10^7).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and 2n integers a_1 to a_{2n}. The values of n and a_1 to a_{2n} are not affected by the code and remain the same as in the initial state.
