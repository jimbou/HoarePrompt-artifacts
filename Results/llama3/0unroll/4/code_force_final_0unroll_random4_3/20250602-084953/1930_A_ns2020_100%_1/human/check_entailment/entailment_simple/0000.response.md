Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and then reads the `2n` integers.
3. It sorts the integers in ascending order.
4. It then prints the sum of every other integer starting from the first one (i.e., the smallest `n` numbers). This is done using the slice `A[::2]`.
5. The program repeats this process for each test case.

The key insight here is that by sorting the integers and then summing the smallest `n` numbers, the program is effectively finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing the `n` moves.

The reason this works is that the moves are performed in a way that maximizes the score. By always choosing the smallest two numbers, we ensure that the score is maximized. And by summing the smallest `n` numbers, we are effectively calculating the maximum final score.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
