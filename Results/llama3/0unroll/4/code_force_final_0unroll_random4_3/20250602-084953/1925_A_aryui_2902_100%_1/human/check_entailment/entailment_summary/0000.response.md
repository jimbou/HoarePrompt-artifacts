Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a string s such that all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s.

The program defines a function func_1() that takes two integers n and k as input, representing the length of the strings and the number of lowercase English alphabets to use, respectively.

Inside the function, it first maps the input values of n and k to the variables n and k. Then, it defines a string s consisting of the first k characters of the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.

The program then returns the string s repeated n times, which is achieved by the expression s[:k] * n.

The execution summary confirms that the function generates a string consisting of the first k characters of the alphabet, repeated n times, based on the input values of n and k.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct. It correctly generates a string that satisfies the condition of containing all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets as subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
