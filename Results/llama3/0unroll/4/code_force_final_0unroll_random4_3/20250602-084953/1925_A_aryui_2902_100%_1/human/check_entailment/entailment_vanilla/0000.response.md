Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1` with these values.
3. The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as input and returns a string `s`.
4. The function `func_1` creates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

* The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `k` for each test case.
* The function `func_1` correctly creates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.
* However, the program does not check if the created string `s` satisfies the condition that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

To determine the correctness of the program, let's consider some examples:

* For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the program returns the string `"ab"`, which is correct because all possible strings of length 1 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ("a" and "b") occur as a subsequence of `"ab"`.
* For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the program returns the string `"aa"`, which is correct because all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet ("a") occur as a subsequence of `"aa"`.
* For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program returns the string `"abab"`, which is incorrect because not all possible strings of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets ("aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb") occur as a subsequence of `"abab"`. For example, the string `"ba"` does not occur as a subsequence of `"abab"`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce a string `s` that satisfies the condition that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.

Correctness: **False**
