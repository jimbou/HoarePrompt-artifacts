Output State: **The program returns a string that consists of the first k characters of the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', repeated n times.**

In this output state, the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' is sliced up to the kth character, where k is an integer between 1 and 26. This sliced string is then repeated n times, where n is an integer between 1 and 26. The resulting string is returned by the program.
