Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 26, k is an integer between 1 and 26, s is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin contains t-1 lines of input, where t is an integer between 1 and 676.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are determined by the first line of input from stdin, which contains two integers. The string `s` is assigned the value 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which is a fixed string of lowercase English letters. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, as specified in the initial state.
