Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the number of elements in the sorted array that are less than or equal to the given value k. The value of k is updated after each iteration based on the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted array, and the number of elements remaining in the array. The final output state is a series of integers representing the number of elements in the sorted array that are less than or equal to the updated value of k.**
