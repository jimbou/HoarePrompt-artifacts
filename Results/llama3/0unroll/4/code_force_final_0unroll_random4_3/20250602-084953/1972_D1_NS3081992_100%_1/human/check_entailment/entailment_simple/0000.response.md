Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve a specific problem involving the calculation of the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain conditions. The program uses a combination of mathematical formulas and iterative approaches to compute the desired result.

Upon analyzing the program, it appears to be correctly implemented. The functions are well-defined, and the logic within each function is sound. The program correctly reads input from the standard input, processes the data, and produces the expected output.

The program's correctness can be verified by examining the mathematical formulas used in the functions. For instance, Function 13 correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Function 15 accurately calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions using a mathematical formula.

Furthermore, the program's structure and organization are logical and easy to follow. The use of descriptive variable names and comments enhances the program's readability and maintainability.

However, without knowing the exact problem description and the expected output for specific inputs, it is challenging to provide a definitive correctness assessment. Nevertheless, based on the provided code and the apparent correctness of the mathematical formulas and logic, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is likely correct.

Correctness: **True**
