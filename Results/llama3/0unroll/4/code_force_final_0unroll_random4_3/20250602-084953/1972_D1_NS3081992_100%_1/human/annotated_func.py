    #The program returns the minimum value returned by `func_12` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0, plus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, based on the results of recursive calls to `func_12` for each unprocessed neighbor of `da`. If `da` has only one neighbor, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through each unprocessed neighbor, temporarily marks it as processed, calculates its rank using `func_12`, and updates the minimum rank found. Finally, it updates the rank of `da` in the `rank` list and returns the minimum rank found plus 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and a % b, and then calculates the coefficients x and y based on the results. The function ultimately returns the GCD and the coefficients x and y.
