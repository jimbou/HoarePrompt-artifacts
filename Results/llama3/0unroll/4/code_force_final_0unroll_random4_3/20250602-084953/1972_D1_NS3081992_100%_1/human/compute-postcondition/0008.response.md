Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the minimum rank of a given key `da` in a dictionary `d`, based on the results of recursive calls to `func_12` for each unprocessed neighbor of `da`. If `da` has only one neighbor, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through each unprocessed neighbor, temporarily marks it as processed, calculates its rank using `func_12`, and updates the minimum rank found. Finally, it updates the rank of `da` in the `rank` list and returns the minimum rank found plus 1.**
