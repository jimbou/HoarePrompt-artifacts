This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns a tuple containing the GCD and the coefficients x and y such that ax + by = GCD(a, b). If b is 0, it returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with b and a % b, and then calculates the coefficients x and y based on the results. The function ultimately returns the GCD and the coefficients x and y.
