Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all possible cases. For example, when the input is (1, 1, 4), the program outputs 2, but the correct output should be -1. This is because it is not possible to achieve the scores (1, 1, 4) with any combination of games and results.

In this case, the program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2, but it does not check if the remaining points can be achieved with wins and losses. The correct approach would be to check if the remaining points can be achieved with wins and losses, and if not, output -1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
