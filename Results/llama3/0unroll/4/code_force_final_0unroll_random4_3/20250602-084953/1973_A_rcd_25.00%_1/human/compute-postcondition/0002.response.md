Output State: **The loop will execute t-1 times, and for each iteration, it will print the result of the calculation based on the input values p1, p2, and p3. The output will be either -1, p1 + p2, or a value calculated by the while loop. The value of t will be decremented by 1 after each iteration, and the final output state will have t = 1.**
