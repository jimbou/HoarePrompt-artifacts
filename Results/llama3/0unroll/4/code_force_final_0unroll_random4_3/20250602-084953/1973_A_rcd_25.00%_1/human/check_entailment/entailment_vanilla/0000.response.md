Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened in a series of chess games between three friends, given their final scores. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the scores of the three players `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are guaranteed to be in non-decreasing order.

3. The program then checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves on to the next test case. This is because the sum of the scores must be even, as each game can result in either a win (2 points), a loss (0 points), or a draw (1 point each).

4. If the sum of the scores is even, the program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If it is, the program prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. This is because in this case, the maximum number of draws is achieved when `p1` and `p2` play each other, resulting in `p1` draws.

5. If `p3` is not greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program calculates the range of possible draws by finding the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1`, and `p3` and `p2`. It then iterates over this range, starting from the minimum difference, and checks if the current difference can result in a valid set of games.

6. If a valid set of games is found, the program prints the maximum number of draws. If no valid set of games is found after iterating over the entire range, the program prints `p3`.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly handles the case where the sum of the scores is odd, and it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws in the other cases.

Correctness: **True**
