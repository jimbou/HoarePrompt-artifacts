Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the different cases as described in the problem statement.

1. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1, which is correct because the total number of points awarded in any number of games must be even (each game awards 2 points in total).

2. If the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it prints the sum of the two lower scores. This is correct because in this case, the player with the highest score must have won all their games against the other two players, and the maximum number of draws is achieved when the other two players draw all their games against each other.

3. In the other cases, it performs a calculation using a while loop to determine the result. This calculation is correct because it iterates over all possible numbers of draws between the player with the highest score and the player with the lowest score, and checks if the remaining points can be distributed among the players in a valid way. If it finds such a distribution, it prints the corresponding number of draws.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws that could have happened in all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
