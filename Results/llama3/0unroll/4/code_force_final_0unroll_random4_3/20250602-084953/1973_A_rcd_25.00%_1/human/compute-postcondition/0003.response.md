Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers representing the scores of three players. It then calculates and prints the result for each test case based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the highest score is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it prints the sum of the two lower scores. Otherwise, it performs a calculation using a while loop to determine the result, which is either the highest score or a calculated value. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, printing a result for each one.**
