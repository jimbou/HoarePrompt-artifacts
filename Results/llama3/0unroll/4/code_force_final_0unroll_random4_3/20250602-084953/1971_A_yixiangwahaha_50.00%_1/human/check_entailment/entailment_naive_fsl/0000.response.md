Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the number of test cases (t) is not equal to 10. In the problem description, it is stated that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, but the program assumes that t is always 10. If t is less than 10, the program will still try to read 10 lines of input, which will cause an error. If t is greater than 10, the program will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore the rest.

For example, if the input is:

5
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0

The program will still try to read 5 more lines of input, which will cause an error.

To fix this issue, the program should read the value of t and use it to control the number of iterations in the loop. Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, ' ', y)
        else:
            print(y, ' ', x)
