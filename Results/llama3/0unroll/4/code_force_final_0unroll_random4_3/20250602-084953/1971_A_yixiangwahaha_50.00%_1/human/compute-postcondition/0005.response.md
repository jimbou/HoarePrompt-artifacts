Functionality: **This function reads input from the standard input, expecting an integer t between 1 and 100, followed by t lines of two space-separated integers x and y between 0 and 9. It then prints 10 lines to the console, each containing two integers: the smaller of x[i] and y[i] followed by the larger of x[i] and y[i] for each i between 0 and 9. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to output the sorted pairs of integers read from the input.**
