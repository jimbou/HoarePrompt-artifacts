Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly checks if it's possible for Bob to make all parts of the ribbon the same color by repainting at most `k` parts. If this condition is true, it means Bob can make all parts the same color, so the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

Correctness: **True**
