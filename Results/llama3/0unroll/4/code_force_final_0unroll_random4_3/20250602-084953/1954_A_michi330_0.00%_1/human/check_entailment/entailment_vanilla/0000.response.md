Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of parts `n`, the number of colors `m`, and the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`.
3. The program checks two conditions:
   - `n <= k`: If the number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint, it means Bob can repaint all parts to have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition calculates the minimum number of parts that must have a different color than the most frequent color. If this number is less than `k`, it means Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.
4. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
