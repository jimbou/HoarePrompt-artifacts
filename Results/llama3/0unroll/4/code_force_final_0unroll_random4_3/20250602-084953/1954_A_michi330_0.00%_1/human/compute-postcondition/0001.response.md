Output State: **The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, with the number of lines equal to the value of t. Each line will correspond to the result of the condition check for the respective input values of n, m, and k. The values of t, n, m, and k will remain unchanged, as they are only used within the loop and do not affect the overall state.**
