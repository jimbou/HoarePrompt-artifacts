This function reads a series of input values from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, m, and k. It then evaluates a condition for each set of input values and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. The condition checks if n is greater than k and if n minus the ceiling of n divided by m is greater than or equal to k. The function prints the result of each condition check to the console, with the number of lines equal to the value of t.
