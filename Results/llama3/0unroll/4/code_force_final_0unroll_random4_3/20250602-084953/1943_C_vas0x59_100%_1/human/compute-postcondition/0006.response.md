Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b, in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list**

In this output state, the variable `path_ba` still holds the same value as in the initial state, which is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b, in reverse order. The variable `ops` is newly introduced and is assigned an empty list.
