Output State: ops is a list containing tuples of the form (c, i), where i ranges from 0 to ci, and the length of ops is ci + 1, ci is the index of the middle element in path_ba, c is the value at the middle index of path_ba, and path_ba is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b, in reverse order, and the length of path_ba is odd.
