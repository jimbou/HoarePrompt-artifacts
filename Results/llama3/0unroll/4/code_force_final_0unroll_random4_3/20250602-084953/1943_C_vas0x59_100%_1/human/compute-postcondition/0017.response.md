The code prints the operations performed on the path from vertex a to vertex b, represented as pairs of vertex index and list index. Each pair is printed on a new line, with the vertex index incremented by 1 for display purposes.

If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the operations are represented as pairs (c, i) for i from 0 to ci, where c and ci remain unchanged. In this case, the output will be a list of pairs, where each pair contains a vertex index (c + 1) and a list index i.

If the length of `path_ba` is even, the operations are represented as tuples containing a vertex index and a list index. In this case, the output will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a vertex index (incremented by 1 for display) and a list index.

Output: **A list of pairs or tuples representing the operations performed on the path from vertex a to vertex b, with each pair or tuple printed on a new line, and vertex indices incremented by 1 for display purposes.**
