Output State: **path_ba is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b, in reverse order.**

The output state is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b, in reverse order. This means that the list path_ba will contain the indices of the vertices in the shortest path, starting from the vertex at index b and ending at the vertex at index a, in reverse order.
