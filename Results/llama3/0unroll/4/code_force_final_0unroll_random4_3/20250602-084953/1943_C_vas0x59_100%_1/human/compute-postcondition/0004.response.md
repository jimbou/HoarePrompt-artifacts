Output State: path_ba is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b.

The loop iterates until it reaches the vertex at index a, which is the starting point of the shortest path. In each iteration, it appends the previous vertex in the shortest path to the path_ba list. When it reaches the vertex at index a, it breaks the loop. As a result, path_ba contains the indices of all the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b.
