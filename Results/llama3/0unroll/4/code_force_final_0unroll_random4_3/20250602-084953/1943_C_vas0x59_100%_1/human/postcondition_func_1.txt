This function reads input from the user to construct an undirected graph, finds the shortest path between two vertices, and then performs operations on this path based on its length. If the path length is odd, it generates a list of pairs containing a central vertex index and a list index, ranging from 0 to the central index. If the path length is even, it generates a list of tuples representing operations performed on the path, where each tuple contains a vertex index and a list index. The function then prints the length of the operations list and the operations themselves, with vertex indices incremented by 1 for display purposes. Finally, the function returns None without modifying any variables.
