Output State: **path_ba is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b, in reverse order; ops is an empty list; ci2 is the half of the length of path_ba; ci1 is one less than ci2; c1 is the element of path_ba at index ci1; c2 is the element of path_ba at index ci2.**

In this output state, the length of `path_ba` is still even, and `ops` remains an empty list. The new variables `ci2`, `ci1`, `c1`, and `c2` are introduced, with `ci2` being half the length of `path_ba`, `ci1` being one less than `ci2`, and `c1` and `c2` being the elements of `path_ba` at indices `ci1` and `ci2`, respectively.
