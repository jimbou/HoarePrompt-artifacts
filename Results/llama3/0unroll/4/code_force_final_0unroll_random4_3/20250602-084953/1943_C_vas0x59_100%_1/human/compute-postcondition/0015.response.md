The code prints the length of the `ops` list.
If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains the pairs (c, i) for i from 0 to ci, and the values of `path_ba`, `ci`, and `c` remain unchanged. In this case, the length of `ops` will be ci + 1.
If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a vertex index and a list index, representing the operations performed on the path from vertex a to vertex b; the other variables remain unchanged. In this case, the length of `ops` will be equal to the number of operations performed on the path from vertex a to vertex b.
Output: **the length of ops (which is ci + 1 if the length of path_ba is odd, or the number of operations performed on the path from vertex a to vertex b if the length of path_ba is even)**
