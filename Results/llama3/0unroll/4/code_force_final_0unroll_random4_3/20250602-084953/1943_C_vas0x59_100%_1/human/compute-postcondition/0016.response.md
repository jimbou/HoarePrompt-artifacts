Output: **`path_ba` is a list containing the indices of the vertices in the shortest path from the vertex at index a to the vertex at index b, in reverse order; `ops` is a list. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains the pairs (c, i) for i from 0 to ci, and the values of `path_ba`, `ci`, and `c` remain unchanged. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a vertex index and a list index, representing the operations performed on the path from vertex a to vertex b; the other variables remain unchanged, and the length of `ops` is being printed**
