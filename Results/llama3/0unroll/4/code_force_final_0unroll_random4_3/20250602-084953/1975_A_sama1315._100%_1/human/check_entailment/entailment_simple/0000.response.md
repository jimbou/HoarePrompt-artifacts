Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the specified operation any number of times.

The function `func_1` takes an array `a` as input and checks if any sub-list of `a + a` (i.e., the array concatenated with itself) is equal to the sorted version of `a`. If such a sub-list is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can become sorted. If no such sub-list is found after checking all possible sub-lists, it returns 'No'.

The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it into a list of integers, and then calls `func_1` on each slice of the list. It then prints the results of these function calls, separated by newline characters.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem description, and it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
