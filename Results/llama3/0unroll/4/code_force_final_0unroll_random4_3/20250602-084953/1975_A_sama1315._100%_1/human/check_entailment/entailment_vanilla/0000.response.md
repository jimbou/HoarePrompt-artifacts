Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The provided program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes an array `a` as input and checks if it can be sorted by concatenating it with itself and checking if the sorted array is a substring of the concatenated array. This approach is correct because if the array can be sorted by swapping two parts, the sorted array must be a contiguous subarray of the concatenated array.

`func_2` reads input from the standard input, parses it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and uses a valid approach to solve it. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
