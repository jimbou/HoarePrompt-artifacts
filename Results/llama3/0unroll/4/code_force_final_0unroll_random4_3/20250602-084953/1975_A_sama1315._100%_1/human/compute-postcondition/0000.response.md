Output State: **data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer, idx is 1, t is a positive integer, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer such that n < len(data) - idx**

The code reads the entire standard input into the `data` variable, splitting it into a list of strings where each string represents an integer. The `idx` variable is initialized to 0 and then incremented to 1 after reading the first integer from `data` and converting it to an integer, which is assigned to the variable `t`. The `results` list is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged, still a positive integer such that `n < len(data) - idx`.
