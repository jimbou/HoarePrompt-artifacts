Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The provided functions aim to solve this problem.

Function `func_1` checks if any sub-list of a concatenated version of the input list 'a' (duplicated once) is equal to the sorted version of 'a'. If such a sub-list is found, it returns 'Yes'. If no such sub-list is found after checking all possible sub-lists, it returns 'No'. This function correctly implements the problem's requirement.

Function `func_2` reads input from standard input, extracts a list of integers, and then iterates over the list to extract slices of integers. For each slice, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to a list of results. Finally, it prints the results, separated by newline characters. This function correctly handles the input and output requirements of the problem.

Since both functions work together to correctly solve the problem, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
