Output State: The variable 'idx' is now equal to 'idx + t * (n + 1)', the variable 'results' is a list of 't' elements where each element is the result of the function 'func_1' applied to a sublist of 'n' consecutive integers from the list 'data' starting at index 'idx + i * (n + 1)' for 'i' in range 't', and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
