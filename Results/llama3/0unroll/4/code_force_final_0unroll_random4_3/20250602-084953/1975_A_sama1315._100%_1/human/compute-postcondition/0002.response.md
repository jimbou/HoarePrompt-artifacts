Output State: The loop has executed t iterations, and the results list now contains t elements, each of which is the result of calling func_1 on a slice of the data list. The idx variable has been incremented by t times the value of n (which is the length of the slice of data passed to func_1), plus t (the number of iterations). The data list and the variable n remain unchanged.
