Output State: **The value of variable k is printed to the console for each test case, representing the maximum number of characters that can be matched between the two binary strings a and b. The value of variable a is decremented by 1 after each iteration, and the loop terminates when a becomes 0. The values of variables b, c, d, and e are updated with new values from the input for each iteration.**
