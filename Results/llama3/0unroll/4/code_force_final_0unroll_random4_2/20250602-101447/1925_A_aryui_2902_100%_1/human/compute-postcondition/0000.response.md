Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 26, k is a positive integer between 1 and 26, s is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the two positive integers provided as input, which are between 1 and 26. The variable `s` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The stdin is now empty, as the two inputs have been consumed by the `input().split()` function.
