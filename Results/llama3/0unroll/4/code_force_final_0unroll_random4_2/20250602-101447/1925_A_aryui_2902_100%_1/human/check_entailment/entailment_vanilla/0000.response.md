Reasoning:

The problem requires finding a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The program provided attempts to solve this problem.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1` to compute the result.
3. The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as input and returns a string `s` that is constructed by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

The key insight here is that by repeating the first `k` alphabets `n` times, the resulting string `s` will contain all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` alphabets. This is because each alphabet will appear `n` times in the string, allowing for all possible combinations of length `n` to be formed.

For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` will be `"abab"`, which contains all possible subsequences of length 2 that can be formed using the first 2 alphabets: `"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ba"`, and `"bb"`.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the output will be the smallest possible string `s` that satisfies the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
