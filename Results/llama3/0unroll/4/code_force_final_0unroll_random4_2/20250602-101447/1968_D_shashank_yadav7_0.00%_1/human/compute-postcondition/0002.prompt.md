You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n integers representing the array a. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The permutation p and array a are lists of integers.
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, each time processing a test case from the input. After all iterations, the loop will have printed out the winner of each test case, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', based on the calculated values of bm and sm. The values of n, k, b, s, p, a, sp, bp, bm, and sm will be updated for each test case, but their initial values will be lost after the loop finishes. The final output will be a series of lines, each containing the result of a test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
