Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S. The second line contains n integers representing the permutation p. The third line contains n integers representing the array a. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The permutation p and array a are lists of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of four lines. The first line contains four integers: n, k, P_B, P_S, where n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, and 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n. The second line contains n integers representing the permutation p, and the third line contains n integers representing the array a. The permutation p and array a are lists of integers.
