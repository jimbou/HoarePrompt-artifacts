This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four lines of integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum score that can be achieved by two players, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', based on a given permutation and array. The function then prints out the winner of each test case, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', depending on the calculated scores. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of lines, each containing the result of a test case.
