Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The issue lies in the way the scores are updated. The program updates the scores by adding the maximum of the current score and the score that would be obtained by staying at the current position for the remaining turns. However, this is not correct because the players can choose to move to a different position at each turn, and the program does not take this into account.

A counterexample is when the permutation is [2, 1] and the array is [1, 2]. If Bodya starts at position 1 and Sasha starts at position 2, and k = 2, the program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Bodya". This is because Bodya can move to position 2 at the first turn and stay there for the second turn, getting a total score of 4, while Sasha can only get a total score of 3 by staying at position 2 for both turns.
