Output State: **The loop will execute t times, each time processing a test case from the input. After all iterations, the loop will have printed out the winner of each test case, either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw', based on the calculated values of bm and sm. The values of n, k, b, s, p, a, sp, bp, bm, and sm will be updated for each test case, but their initial values will be lost after the loop finishes. The final output will be a series of lines, each containing the result of a test case.**
