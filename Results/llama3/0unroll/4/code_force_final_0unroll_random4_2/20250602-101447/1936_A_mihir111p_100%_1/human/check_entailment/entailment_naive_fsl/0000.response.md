Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case when the maximum XOR value is not achieved by the pair of indices that have the maximum OR value. 

For example, consider the permutation p = [8, 9, 1, 13, 3, 12, 5, 4, 11, 6, 7, 2, 10, 0]. In this case, the maximum OR value is achieved by the pair of indices (8, 9), but the maximum XOR value is achieved by the pair of indices (8, 13). The program will incorrectly return the pair (8, 9) as the answer.

The program assumes that the maximum XOR value is always achieved by the pair of indices that have the maximum OR value, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
