#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is a positive integer.
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    #This is printed: ? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n)
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that is the input provided by the user, which is expected to be in the format "? a b c d" where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than a positive integer n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function prints a query to the user in the format "? a b c d" where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than a positive integer n, and then returns the user's input as a string, which is expected to be in the same format.
