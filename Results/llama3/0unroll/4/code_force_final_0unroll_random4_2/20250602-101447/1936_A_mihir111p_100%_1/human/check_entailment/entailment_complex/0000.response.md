Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. The program uses a query function `func_1` to ask questions about the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation `p`.

The program first finds the index `ans1` of the maximum element in the permutation by repeatedly comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done in the first loop.

Then, it finds the maximum element `mx` among the remaining elements that have the same bitwise OR with `ans1`. This is done in the second loop.

Finally, it finds the index `ans` of the maximum element among the elements that have the same bitwise OR with `mx`. This is done in the third loop.

The program then prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
