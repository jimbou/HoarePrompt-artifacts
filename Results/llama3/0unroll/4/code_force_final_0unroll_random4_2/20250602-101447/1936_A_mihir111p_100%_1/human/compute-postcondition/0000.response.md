The code prints a string '?' followed by the values of the variables a, b, c, and d. Since a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is a positive integer, the exact values of a, b, c, and d are not specified. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the string '?' followed by the values of a, b, c, and d.

Output: **? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n)**
