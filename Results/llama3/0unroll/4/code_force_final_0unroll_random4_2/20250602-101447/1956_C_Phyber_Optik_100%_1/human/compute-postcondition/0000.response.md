Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In natural language, the output state means that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer larger than 0, which is the first input from the stdin. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, because one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
