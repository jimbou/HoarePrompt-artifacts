Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and provides a solution with no more than 2n operations. The program uses a clever approach to calculate the maximum sum by iterating from 2 to n and adding the difference between the square of the current number and the square of the previous number, multiplied by the current number. This approach ensures that the sum is maximized.

The program then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is 2n. It then prints the operations, which are of type 1 and type 2, with the row or column number and the permutation. The permutation is simply the range from 1 to n, which is a valid permutation.

The program works correctly for all potential cases, including the edge cases where n is 1 or 2. In these cases, the program correctly calculates the maximum sum and provides a solution with no more than 2n operations.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
