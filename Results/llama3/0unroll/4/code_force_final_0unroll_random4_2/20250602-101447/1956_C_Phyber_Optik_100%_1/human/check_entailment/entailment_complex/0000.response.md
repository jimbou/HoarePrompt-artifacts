Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix, which is the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 'n'. It also correctly prints the number of operations, which is 'n + n', and the operations themselves.

The program uses two nested loops to generate the operations. The outer loop runs 'n' times, and the inner loop runs 'n' times for each iteration of the outer loop. This results in a total of 'n + n' operations, which is within the allowed limit of '2n' operations.

The operations themselves are generated correctly. The program prints '1' and 'n - j + 1' (where 'j' ranges from 1 to 'n') followed by a list of numbers from 1 to 'n', and then prints '2' and 'n - j + 1' (where 'j' ranges from 1 to 'n') followed by a list of numbers from 1 to 'n'. This corresponds to the two types of operations allowed in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
