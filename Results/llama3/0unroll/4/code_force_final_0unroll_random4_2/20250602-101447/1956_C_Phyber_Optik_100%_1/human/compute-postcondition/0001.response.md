Output State: **The loop will execute 't' times, each time taking an integer 'n' as input and printing the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 'n' along with 'n + n', followed by 'n' lines of output with '1' and 'n - j + 1' (where 'j' ranges from 1 to 'n') and a list of numbers from 1 to 'n', and then another 'n' lines of output with '2' and 'n - j + 1' (where 'j' ranges from 1 to 'n') and a list of numbers from 1 to 'n'. The value of 't' will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.**
