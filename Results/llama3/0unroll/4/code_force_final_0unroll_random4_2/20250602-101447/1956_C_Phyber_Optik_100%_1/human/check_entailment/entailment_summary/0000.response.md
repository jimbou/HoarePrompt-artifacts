Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix by summing the squares of numbers from 1 to 'n'. The program then prints the maximum sum along with 'n + n', which represents the number of operations required to achieve this sum.

The program then prints 'n' lines of output with '1' and 'n - j + 1' (where 'j' ranges from 1 to 'n') followed by a list of numbers from 1 to 'n', and another 'n' lines of output with '2' and 'n - j + 1' (where 'j' ranges from 1 to 'n') followed by a list of numbers from 1 to 'n'. This represents the operations required to achieve the maximum sum.

The program does not return any value but modifies the standard output based on the input test cases.

Correctness: **True**
