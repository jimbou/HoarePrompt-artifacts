Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a single integer 'n' representing the size of a matrix. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 'n' along with 'n + n'. Then, it prints 'n' lines of output with '1' and 'n - j + 1' (where 'j' ranges from 1 to 'n') followed by a list of numbers from 1 to 'n', and another 'n' lines of output with '2' and 'n - j + 1' (where 'j' ranges from 1 to 'n') followed by a list of numbers from 1 to 'n'. The function does not return any value but modifies the standard output based on the input test cases.**
