Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program works by reading the number of test cases (a) and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers (b and c) representing the number of moves (n) and the desired number of cubes (m) in the tower.

The program then checks the following conditions:

1. If the number of moves (b) is equal to the desired number of cubes (c), it prints 'YES' because Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower for each move.

2. If the number of moves (b) is less than the desired number of cubes (c), it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

3. If the number of moves (b) is greater than the desired number of cubes (c), it checks whether the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. If it is, it prints 'Yes' because Nikita can build a tower with the desired number of cubes by putting cubes on top and then removing some of them. If the difference is odd, it prints 'No' because Nikita cannot build a tower with an odd number of cubes by putting and removing cubes in pairs.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
