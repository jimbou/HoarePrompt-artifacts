Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100). Each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `a` is assigned the integer from the first line of the input, which is between 1 and 100 inclusive. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The remaining lines still contain two integers n and m each, with the same constraints as before.
