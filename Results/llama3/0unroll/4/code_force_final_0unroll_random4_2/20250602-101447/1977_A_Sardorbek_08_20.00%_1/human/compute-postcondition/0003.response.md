Functionality: **The function reads a series of input lines from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, and each subsequent line contains two integers n and m. It then prints a series of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' to the console, depending on the values of n and m, for a total of t lines. The function does not modify the input values or store any results, only printing the output state to the console.**
