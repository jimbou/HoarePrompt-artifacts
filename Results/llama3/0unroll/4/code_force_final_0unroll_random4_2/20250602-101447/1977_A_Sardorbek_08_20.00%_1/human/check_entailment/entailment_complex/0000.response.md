Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
* For each test case, it reads the two integers `n` and `m` and checks the conditions to determine if it's possible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
* The conditions checked are:
	+ If `n` is equal to `m`, it's possible to build a tower with `m` cubes by adding `m` cubes one by one.
	+ If `n` is less than `m`, it's not possible to build a tower with `m` cubes because Nikita can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
	+ If `n` is greater than `m` and `n` and `m` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), it's possible to build a tower with `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in a way that ends up with `m` cubes.
	+ If `n` is greater than `m` and `n` and `m` have different parity, it's not possible to build a tower with `m` cubes because Nikita can't change the parity of the number of cubes by adding and removing cubes.
* The program prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly based on the conditions checked.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves, and it prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
