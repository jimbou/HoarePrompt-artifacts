Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine if it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, either 1 cube is added or removed from the top of the tower. The program reads the number of test cases (a) and then for each test case, it reads the number of moves (b) and the desired number of cubes (c).

The program then checks the following conditions:

1. If b is equal to c, it prints 'YES' because it's possible to build a tower with exactly c cubes after c moves by adding 1 cube in each move.

2. If b is less than c, it prints 'NO' because it's not possible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

3. If b is greater than c, it checks if the remainder of b divided by 2 is equal to the remainder of c divided by 2. If they are equal, it prints 'Yes' because it's possible to build a tower with exactly c cubes after b moves by adding or removing cubes in pairs. If they are not equal, it prints 'No' because it's not possible to build a tower with exactly c cubes after b moves.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
