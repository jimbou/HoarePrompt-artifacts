Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 5 3, the program prints 'Yes', but it should print 'Yes' because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a row, and then remove 2 cubes from the top of the tower.

However, the program does not handle this case correctly. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is not sufficient to determine whether Nikita can obtain a tower with m cubes. This condition only checks if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity, but it does not consider the actual number of moves and cubes.

A correct solution would need to check if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the number of cubes, and if the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even. This is because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower in one move, and remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in one move, so the number of moves must be greater than or equal to the number of cubes, and the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes must be even.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
