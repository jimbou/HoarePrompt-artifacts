Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. The program only checks if the first two elements of the list of 1s are equal, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the shape. It also prints the list of 1s instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

Correctness: **False**
