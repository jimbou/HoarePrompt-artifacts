Output State: **`a` is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters 0 or 1. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the 1s in the grid. The size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each with the same structure as before. The rest of the precondition remains the same, with the grid containing exactly one triangle or square with all 1s, and the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1.
