Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. It only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not a sufficient condition to determine the shape.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
000
011
011
```

The program will print `[2, 2]`, but it does not determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle. In this case, the shape is a square, but the program does not output "SQUARE" as required.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check the pattern of '1's in the grid and determine whether it matches the pattern of a square or a triangle.
