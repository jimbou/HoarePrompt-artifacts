Reasoning:

The given program is not correct. The program is supposed to determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a triangle or a square, but it does not perform any checks to make this determination. Instead, it simply counts the number of '1's in each line and stores them in a list. If the first two elements of the list are equal, it prints the list, but this does not provide any information about the shape.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check the pattern of '1's in the grid to determine whether it forms a triangle or a square. For example, it could check if the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 for a triangle, or if the number of '1's in each row is the same for a square.

Correctness: **False**
