Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if the first two elements of the list 'k' are equal, and if they are, it prints the list 'k'. However, this is not the correct condition to check if the shape is a square or a triangle.

To correctly determine the shape, the program should check the pattern of the number of '1's in each row. For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same, and for a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should increase by 2 in each subsequent row.

The program does not correctly implement this logic, and therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
