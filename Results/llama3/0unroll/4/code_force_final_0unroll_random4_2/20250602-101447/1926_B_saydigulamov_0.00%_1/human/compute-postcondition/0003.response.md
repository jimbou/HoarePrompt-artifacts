Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of n characters (0s and 1s). It then counts the number of 1s in each line and stores them in a list. If the first two elements of the list are equal, it prints the list. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, leaving the input variable unchanged.**
