Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

2. The program does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle correctly. It does not check the number of '1's in each row to see if it matches the pattern of a triangle (i.e., 2*i - 1 '1's in the i-th row).

3. The program does not handle the case where the shape is a square correctly. It does not check if the number of '1's in each row is the same as the number of rows.

4. The program does not print the correct output. It prints the number of '1's in the first two rows, but it should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" depending on the shape.

5. The program does not handle the case where the input is invalid. It assumes that the input will always be a valid grid with a shape, but it does not check for this.

Correctness: **False**
