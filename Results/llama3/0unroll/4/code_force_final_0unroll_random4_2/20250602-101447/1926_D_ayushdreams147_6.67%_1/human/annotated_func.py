#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers less than 2^31.
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The count dictionary contains the frequency of each number in the list a, but with all numbers negated and decremented by 1, and res is equal to the number of unique numbers in the list a.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique numbers in the list a.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the number of unique numbers in the list. It also modifies the input list by negating and decrementing each number by 1, and stores the frequency of each modified number in a dictionary. The function does not modify the original input list, but rather creates a new dictionary to store the frequency of the modified numbers.
