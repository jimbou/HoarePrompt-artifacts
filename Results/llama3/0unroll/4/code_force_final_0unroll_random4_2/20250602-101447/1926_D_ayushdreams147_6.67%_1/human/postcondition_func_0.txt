This function takes a list of non-negative integers as input and returns the number of unique numbers in the list. It also modifies the input list by negating and decrementing each number by 1, and stores the frequency of each modified number in a dictionary. The function does not modify the original input list, but rather creates a new dictionary to store the frequency of the modified numbers.
