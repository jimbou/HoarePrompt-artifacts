Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. We have three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` takes the number of extroverts and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate them. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If it's not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed.

`func_2` takes the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals as input and returns the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants. It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals and adds the number of introverts to the result. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

Now, let's analyze the correctness of the program.

*   The program correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. It checks if the remaining extroverts plus the number of universals is less than 3, and if so, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.
*   The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the extroverts and universals. It uses the ceiling function to round up the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which ensures that we have enough tents to accommodate all participants.
*   The program correctly adds the number of introverts to the result, since each introvert needs their own tent.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the `func_1` function, when the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts plus the number of universals is less than 3. If it is, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. But this is not correct. If the remaining extroverts plus the number of universals is equal to 3, it's actually possible to accommodate the participants.

Correctness: **False**
