Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to solve this problem.

`func_1` calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It first checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If it's not, it checks if the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by 3.

`func_2` calculates the total minimum number of tents needed by calling `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals, and then adding the number of introverts. If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the participants.

The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and where the sum of the remainder of extroverts divided by 3 and universals is less than 3. It also correctly adds the number of introverts to the result.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
