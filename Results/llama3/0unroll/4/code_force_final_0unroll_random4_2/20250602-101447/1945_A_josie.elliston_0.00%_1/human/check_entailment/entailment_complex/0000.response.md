Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, as input. It checks if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and if the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3. If this condition is true, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

`func_2` takes three non-negative integers, `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, as input. It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and stores the return value in `ret`. If `ret` is `None`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed. `func_1` handles the case where `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and there are not enough `universals` to fill the remaining spots. `func_2` adds the number of `introverts` to the result of `func_1`, which is the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the `extroverts` and `universals`.

Correctness: **True**
