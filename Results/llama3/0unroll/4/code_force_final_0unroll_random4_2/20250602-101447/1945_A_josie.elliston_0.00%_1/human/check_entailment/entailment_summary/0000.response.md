Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` takes two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, as input and returns either `None` or the ceiling of their sum divided by 3. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3 and `universals` is less than 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

`func_2` calculates and returns either -1 or the sum of the input `introverts` and the result of `func_1` called with inputs `extroverts` and `universals`. If `func_1` returns `None`, the function returns -1; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the return value of `func_1`.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed. `func_1` handles the case where `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and there are not enough `universals` to fill the remaining spots in the tents. `func_2` then adds the number of `introverts` to the result of `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

The execution summaries provided match the expected output for the given input values.

Correctness: **True**
