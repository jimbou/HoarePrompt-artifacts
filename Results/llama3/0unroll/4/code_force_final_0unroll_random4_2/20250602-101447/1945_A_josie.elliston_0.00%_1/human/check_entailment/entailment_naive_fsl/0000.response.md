Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals, while `func_2` combines this result with the number of introverts to find the total minimum number of tents.

`func_1` correctly handles the cases where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the participants. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals.

`func_2` simply adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1`. Since each introvert needs a separate tent, this is the correct way to calculate the total minimum number of tents.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, or where there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents with extroverts. Therefore, the program is correct.

Note that the program assumes that the input values are non-negative integers, as specified in the problem description. If the input values can be negative or non-integer, the program may not work correctly. However, based on the problem description, it is reasonable to assume that the input values are non-negative integers.
