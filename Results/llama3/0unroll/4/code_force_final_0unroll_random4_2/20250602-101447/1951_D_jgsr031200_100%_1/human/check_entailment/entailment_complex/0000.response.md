Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to reach a target value `k` by repeatedly subtracting two specific costs from an initial value `n`. The program prints 'YES' if it is possible and 'NO' otherwise. If 'YES' is printed, the program also prints the number of subtractions required (either 1 or 2) and the costs used to reach the target value.

The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is equal to `k`, `n` is less than `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. In the case where `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program calculates the costs required to reach `k` and checks if the total cost is less than `k`. If the total cost is less than `k`, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the costs.

The program does not return any value, but this is not a problem because the function is designed to print the results directly.

Correctness: **True**
