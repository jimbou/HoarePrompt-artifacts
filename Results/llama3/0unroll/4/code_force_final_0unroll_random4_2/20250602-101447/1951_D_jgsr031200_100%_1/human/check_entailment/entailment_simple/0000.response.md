Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program correctly handles the three possible cases:

1.  If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
2.  If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.
3.  If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, it prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the limit of 60 stalls and the requirement that the price per jewel be an integer between 1 and 10^18.

Correctness: **True**
