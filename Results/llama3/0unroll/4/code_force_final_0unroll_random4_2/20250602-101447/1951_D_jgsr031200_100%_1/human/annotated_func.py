    #State: Output State: n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is an integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^18.

    #State: *n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the costs list containing n - k + 1 and 1 is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether it is possible to reach a target value `k` by repeatedly subtracting two specific costs from an initial value `n`. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible and 'NO' otherwise. If 'YES' is printed, the function also prints the number of subtractions required (either 1 or 2) and the costs used to reach the target value. The function does not return any value.
