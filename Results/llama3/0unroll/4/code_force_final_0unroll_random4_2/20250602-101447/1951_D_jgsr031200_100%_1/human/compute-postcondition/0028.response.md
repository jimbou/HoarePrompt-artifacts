Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to reach a target value `k` by repeatedly subtracting two specific costs from an initial value `n`. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible and 'NO' otherwise. If 'YES' is printed, the function also prints the number of subtractions required (either 1 or 2) and the costs used to reach the target value. The function does not return any value.**
