Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the costs list containing n - k + 1 and 1 is printed.***
