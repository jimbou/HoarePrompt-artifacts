You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18.
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with n and k being equal integers between 1 and 10^18, 'YES' printed, and 1 printed twice.
    #State: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty, and the values of n and k remain unchanged, with n still being less than k. The program also still prints 'NO'.
    #State: *n and k are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is an integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^18.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: -k + 1 + n, 1 (where -k + 1 + n is a negative integer less than -k + 1 and 1 is the second element of the costs list)
    #State: *n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1. If h is less than k, 'NO' is printed. If h is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the costs list containing n - k + 1 and 1 is printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with n and k being equal integers between 1 and 10^18, 'YES' printed, and 1 printed twice.

Case_2: The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty, and the values of n and k remain unchanged, with n still being less than k. The program also still prints 'NO'.

Case_3: n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is an integer such that 1 <= h < k, and 'NO' is printed

Case_4: n is an integer such that 0 <= n < k, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is less than k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is an integer such that 1 <= h <= 10^18, and h is greater than or equal to k, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and the costs list containing n - k + 1 and 1 is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
