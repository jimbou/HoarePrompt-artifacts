Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, n is not equal to k, and n is larger than or equal to k, costs is a list containing two integers: n - k + 1 and 1, h is 0**

The code initializes a list called `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. The value of `n - k + 1` is calculated based on the initial values of `n` and `k`, which are integers such that `1 <= n, k <= 10^18`, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is larger than or equal to `k`. The second element of the list is simply `1`. The variable `h` is initialized to `0`. No other variables are affected by the code.
