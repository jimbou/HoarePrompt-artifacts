Based on the precondition, the `costs` list contains two integers: `n - k + 1` and `1`. The `print(*costs)` statement will unpack the elements of the `costs` list and print them separated by spaces.

Since `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n < k`, and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= 10^18`, the value of `n - k + 1` will be a negative integer. Specifically, it will be `-k + 1 + n`, which is less than `-k + 1` since `n < k`.

Therefore, the output will be the negative integer `-k + 1 + n` followed by the integer `1`.

Output: **-k + 1 + n, 1 (where -k + 1 + n is a negative integer less than -k + 1 and 1 is the second element of the costs list)**
