Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Bob to set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program uses a greedy approach, where it first checks if the number of coins Alice has (n) is equal to the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy (k). If they are equal, it prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1.

If n is not equal to k, the program calculates two costs: n - k + 1 and 1. It then calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with each cost and subtracts the total cost from n. If the total number of jewels bought is less than k, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls with the calculated costs.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. It correctly handles the case where n is equal to k, and it correctly calculates the costs and number of jewels bought in the other cases.

Correctness: **True**
