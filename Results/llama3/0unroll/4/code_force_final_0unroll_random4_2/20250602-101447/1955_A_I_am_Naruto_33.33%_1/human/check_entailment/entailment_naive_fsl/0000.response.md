Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka". It considers two cases: buying all yogurts at the regular price (a * n) and buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If n is 1, it prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (a).
* If n is greater than 1, it calculates the cost of buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price and the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price, and prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program also handles edge cases correctly:

* If a is less than or equal to b, the program will always print the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
* If a is greater than b, the program will always print the cost of buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (b * n // 2 + a * n % 2).

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
