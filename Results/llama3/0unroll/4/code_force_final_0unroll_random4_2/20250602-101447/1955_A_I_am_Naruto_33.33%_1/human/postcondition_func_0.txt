This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum of two values: the product of n and a, and the product of n and b divided by 2 plus the remainder of the product of n and a divided by 2. If n is 1, it simply prints the value of a. The function processes all test cases and produces the corresponding output.
