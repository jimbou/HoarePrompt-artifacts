Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input and calculates two possible costs:
	* `ans1`: the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price `a`.
	* `ans2`: the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price `b`, which is calculated as the product of `n` and `b` divided by 2 (to get the number of pairs of yogurts) plus the remainder of `n` divided by 2 (to account for any single yogurt).
3. The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. If `n` is 1, it simply prints the value of `a`, as there is no promotion to consider.
4. The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is 1, as well as cases where `n` is even or odd.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
