Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`.
3. If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   * `ans1`: the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price `a`.
   * `ans2`: the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price `b`, which is calculated by dividing `n` by 2 (integer division) to get the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, multiplying this by `b`, and then adding the cost of buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price `a`.
4. The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
5. If `n` is 1, the program simply prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price `a`.

The program correctly handles the cases where it is more advantageous to buy yogurts at the promotion price or at the regular price, as demonstrated by the example test cases.

Correctness: **True**
