Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price of one yogurt (a), and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b).
3.  If n is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:

    *   `ans1`: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a \* n).
    *   `ans2`: The cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion. This is calculated by dividing n by 2 (integer division), multiplying the result by b (the price of two yogurts on promotion), and adding the cost of any remaining yogurts (a \* n % 2).
4.  The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which represents the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.
5.  If n is 1, the program simply prints the value of a, as there is no promotion for buying a single yogurt.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, producing the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
