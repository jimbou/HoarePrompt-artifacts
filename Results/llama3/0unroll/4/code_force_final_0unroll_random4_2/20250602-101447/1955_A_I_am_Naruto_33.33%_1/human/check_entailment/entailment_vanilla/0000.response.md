Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) from the input.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers: n (the number of yogurts), a (the price of one yogurt), and b (the price of two yogurts on promotion).
3. If n is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - ans1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (a * n).
   - ans2: The cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price (b * n // 2) plus the cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price (a * n % 2).
4. The program then prints the minimum of these two costs (min(ans1, ans2)).
5. If n is 1, the program simply prints the price of one yogurt (a).

The program's logic is correct because it considers both possible scenarios:

- Buying all yogurts at the regular price.
- Buying yogurts in pairs using the promotion price and buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

By comparing these two costs and printing the minimum, the program ensures that it finds the most cost-effective way for Maxim to buy n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
