This function calculates the maximum achievable sum by iteratively removing elements from a sorted list and adjusting the sum based on the number of negative elements. It takes three inputs: removals (the number of elements to remove), negatives (the number of negative elements to consider), and elements (a sorted list of integers). If the input pair (removals, negatives) is (6, 3), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a list of sums by subtracting twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements from the total sum, then iteratively subtracting elements and adjusting the sum based on the number of negative elements. The function returns the maximum value from this list of sums.
