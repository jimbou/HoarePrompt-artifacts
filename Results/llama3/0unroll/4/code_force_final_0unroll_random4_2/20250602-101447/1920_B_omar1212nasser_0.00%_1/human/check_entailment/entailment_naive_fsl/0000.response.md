Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the function `func_2`. The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is hardcoded and does not make sense in the context of the problem. This condition will return 0 for any input where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, regardless of the actual elements in the array. This is not the optimal solution for the game, as it does not take into account the actual values of the elements in the array.

For example, if the input is `n = 6, k = 6, x = 3` and the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the program will return 0, but the optimal solution would be to remove the elements 1, 2, and 3, and then Bob would multiply the elements 4, 5, and 6 by -1, resulting in a sum of -6.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
