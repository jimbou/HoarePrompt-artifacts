Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list 'pos', which contains 'removals + 1' elements. Each element in 'pos' is the sum of all elements in the sorted list 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives' elements in 'elements', and then 'removals' iterations of the sum of all elements in 'elements' minus twice the sum of the last 'negatives + i' elements in 'elements' for 'i' in range(1, 'removals + 1').**
