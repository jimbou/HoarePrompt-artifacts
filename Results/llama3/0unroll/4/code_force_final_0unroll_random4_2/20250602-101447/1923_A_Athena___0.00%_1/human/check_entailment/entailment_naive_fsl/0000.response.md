Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block. The issue lies in the fact that the program simply counts the number of zeros in the array after removing leading and trailing zeros. However, this approach does not take into account the actual positions of the chips and the free cells.

For example, consider the input:

5
1 0 1 0 1

The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 2. The program does not correctly handle cases where there are multiple blocks of chips separated by free cells.

A correct solution would involve finding the first and last occurrences of 1 in the array, and then counting the number of zeros between them. This would give the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
