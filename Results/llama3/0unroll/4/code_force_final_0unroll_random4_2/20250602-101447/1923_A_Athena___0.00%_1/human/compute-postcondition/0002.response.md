Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It removes leading and trailing zeros from each list, counts the remaining zeros, and prints the modified list followed by the count of zeros. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the results for each case, leaving the original input unchanged.**
