Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1). At least one a_i is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin still contains t test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where at least one a_i is 1. The values of n and a_i are still valid and unchanged.
