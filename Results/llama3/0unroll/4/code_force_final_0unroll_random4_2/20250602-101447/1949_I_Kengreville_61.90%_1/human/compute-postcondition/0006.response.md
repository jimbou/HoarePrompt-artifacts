Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` True values, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `n` integers representing the coefficients of the nodes in the DFS traversal, `nodes` is a list of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, and `ok` is True, indicating that at least one node in the DFS traversal has a non-zero coefficient, meaning the graph contains a cycle.***
