This function determines whether a graph represented by input lists `x` and `y` contains a cycle. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on the graph, updating the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists accordingly. If the graph contains a cycle, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function maintains the original input values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `r`, and updates the `ok` variable to indicate the presence or absence of a cycle.
