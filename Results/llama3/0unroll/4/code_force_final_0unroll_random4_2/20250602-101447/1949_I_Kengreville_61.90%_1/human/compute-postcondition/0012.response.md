Postcondition: **The program executes a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on a graph represented by input lists `x` and `y`, and determines whether the graph contains a cycle. If the graph contains a cycle (i.e., `ok` is True), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program maintains the original input values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `r`, and updates the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists based on the DFS traversal. The `ok` variable is set to True if at least one node has a non-zero coefficient, indicating a cycle, and False otherwise.**
