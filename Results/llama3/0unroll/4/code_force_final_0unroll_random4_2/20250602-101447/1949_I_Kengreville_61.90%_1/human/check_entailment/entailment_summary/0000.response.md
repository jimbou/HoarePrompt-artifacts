Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to change the radii of disks in such a way that disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other, no two disks overlap in a region of positive area, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `dfs`. The `func_1` function reads the input, initializes the necessary variables, and performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on the graph represented by the input lists `x` and `y`. The `dfs` function is a recursive function that performs the DFS traversal.

The program correctly implements the DFS traversal and updates the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists accordingly. The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are used to keep track of the coefficients of the radii of the disks, and the `nodes` list is used to keep track of the nodes that are visited during the DFS traversal.

The program correctly checks whether the graph contains a cycle by checking whether the sum of the coefficients of the radii of the disks is non-zero. If the graph contains a cycle, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
