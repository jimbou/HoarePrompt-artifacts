You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, nodes is a list of integers.
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer equal to the input value, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef0 is a list of n None values, coef1 is a list of n None values, and nodes is an empty list.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:
    #
    #- `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer equal to the input value.
    #- `x` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers.
    #- `y` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers.
    #- `r` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers.
    #- `visited` is a list of `n` True values, as each node is visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.
    #- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `n` integers, where each element represents the coefficients of the nodes in the DFS traversal. The values of these coefficients depend on the structure of the graph represented by the input lists `x` and `y`.
    #- `nodes` is a list of nodes that were visited during the DFS traversal.
    #- `ok` is True if at least one node in the DFS traversal has a non-zero coefficient, indicating that the graph contains a cycle. Otherwise, `ok` is False.
    #
    #Note that the exact values of `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` depend on the specific input graph represented by `x` and `y`, which is not provided in the problem statement.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The program executes a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on a graph represented by input lists `x` and `y`, and determines whether the graph contains a cycle. If the graph contains a cycle (i.e., `ok` is True), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program maintains the original input values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `r`, and updates the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists based on the DFS traversal. The `ok` variable is set to True if at least one node has a non-zero coefficient, indicating a cycle, and False otherwise.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `n` is a positive integer equal to the input value, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` True values, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `n` integers representing the coefficients of the nodes in the DFS traversal, `nodes` is a list of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, and `ok` is True, indicating that at least one node in the DFS traversal has a non-zero coefficient, meaning the graph contains a cycle, and 'YES' is printed

Case_2: `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer equal to the input value. `x` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers. `y` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers. `r` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers. `visited` is a list of `n` True values, as each node is visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `n` integers, where each element represents the coefficients of the nodes in the DFS traversal. The values of these coefficients depend on the structure of the graph represented by the input lists `x` and `y`. `nodes` is a list of nodes that were visited during the DFS traversal. `ok` is False, indicating that no node in the DFS traversal has a non-zero coefficient, meaning the graph does not contain a cycle. The string 'NO' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
