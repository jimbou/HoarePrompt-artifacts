Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged as a positive integer equal to the input value. `x` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers. `y` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers. `r` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers. `visited` is a list of `n` True values, as each node is visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `n` integers, where each element represents the coefficients of the nodes in the DFS traversal. The values of these coefficients depend on the structure of the graph represented by the input lists `x` and `y`. `nodes` is a list of nodes that were visited during the DFS traversal. `ok` is False, indicating that no node in the DFS traversal has a non-zero coefficient, meaning the graph does not contain a cycle.***
