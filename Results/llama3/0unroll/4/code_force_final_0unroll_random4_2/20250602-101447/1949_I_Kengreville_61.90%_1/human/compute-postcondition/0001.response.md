Output State: **i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of n boolean values where visited[i] is True, nodes is a list of integers where i is appended to the end, x and y are lists of n integers, r is a list of n positive integers, coef0 and coef1 are lists of n real numbers.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `visited` list is updated such that the value at index `i` is now `True`, indicating that the node at index `i` has been visited. The `nodes` list is extended by appending the value of `i` to the end. The other variables, `x`, `y`, `r`, `coef0`, and `coef1`, remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
