Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

    0 0 1
    
    4 -3 4
    
    11 0 3

    YES

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

First sample (left) and a valid way to change the radii of the disks (right).

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, x, y, and r are lists of integers of length n, visited is a list of boolean values of length n, coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers of length n, nodes is a list of integers.
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n

    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: n is a positive integer equal to the input value, x is a list of n integers, y is a list of n integers, r is a list of n integers, visited is a list of n False values, coef0 is a list of n None values, coef1 is a list of n None values, and nodes is an empty list.
    ok = False

        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0

            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:

            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:
    #
    #- `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer equal to the input value.
    #- `x` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers.
    #- `y` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers.
    #- `r` remains unchanged as a list of `n` integers.
    #- `visited` is a list of `n` True values, as each node is visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.
    #- `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `n` integers, where each element represents the coefficients of the nodes in the DFS traversal. The values of these coefficients depend on the structure of the graph represented by the input lists `x` and `y`.
    #- `nodes` is a list of nodes that were visited during the DFS traversal.
    #- `ok` is True if at least one node in the DFS traversal has a non-zero coefficient, indicating that the graph contains a cycle. Otherwise, `ok` is False.
    #
    #Note that the exact values of `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` depend on the specific input graph represented by `x` and `y`, which is not provided in the problem statement.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The program executes a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on a graph represented by input lists `x` and `y`, and determines whether the graph contains a cycle. If the graph contains a cycle (i.e., `ok` is True), the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program maintains the original input values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `r`, and updates the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists based on the DFS traversal. The `ok` variable is set to True if at least one node has a non-zero coefficient, indicating a cycle, and False otherwise.


#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of n boolean values, nodes is a list of integers, x and y are lists of n integers, r is a list of n positive integers, coef0 and coef1 are lists of n real numbers.
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True

            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
            
        #State: visited is a list of n boolean values where visited[j] is True for all j such that (r[i] + r[j])
    #State: *i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of n boolean values, nodes is a list of integers, x and y are lists of n integers, r is a list of n positive integers, coef0 and coef1 are lists of n real numbers. If visited[i] is False, then visited is updated to a list of n boolean values where visited[j] is True for all j such that (r[i] + r[j]) <= coef0[j]*x[j] + coef1[j]*y[j]. Otherwise, no changes are made to the visited list.
