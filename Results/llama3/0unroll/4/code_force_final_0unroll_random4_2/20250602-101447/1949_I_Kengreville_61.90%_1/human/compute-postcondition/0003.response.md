Postcondition: ***i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, visited is a list of n boolean values, nodes is a list of integers, x and y are lists of n integers, r is a list of n positive integers, coef0 and coef1 are lists of n real numbers. If visited[i] is False, then visited is updated to a list of n boolean values where visited[j] is True for all j such that (r[i] + r[j]) <= coef0[j]*x[j] + coef1[j]*y[j]. Otherwise, no changes are made to the visited list.***
