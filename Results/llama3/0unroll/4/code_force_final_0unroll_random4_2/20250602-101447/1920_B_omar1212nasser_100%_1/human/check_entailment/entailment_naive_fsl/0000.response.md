Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the game strategy described in the problem description. 

Function 1 reads the input and calls Function 2 to calculate the maximum sum of elements after the game. 

Function 2 sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the sum of all elements. It then calculates the maximum sum by considering all possible removals of elements by Alice and negations by Bob. 

The program correctly handles the edge cases where Alice or Bob can remove or negate all elements. 

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting, where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the input array. 

The program correctly outputs the maximum sum of elements after the game for all test cases. 

Therefore, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
