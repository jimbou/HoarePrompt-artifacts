Output State: **low = pos, high = pos, st = {mid1, mid2, ..., midn}, where mid1, mid2, ..., midn are the indices of the elements in arr that were compared to k during the loop executions.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

After the loop finishes executing, the value of 'low' and 'high' will be equal to the index of the first occurrence of 'k' in 'arr', or -1 if 'k' is not found in 'arr'. The set 'st' will contain the indices of all the elements in 'arr' that were compared to 'k' during the loop executions.
