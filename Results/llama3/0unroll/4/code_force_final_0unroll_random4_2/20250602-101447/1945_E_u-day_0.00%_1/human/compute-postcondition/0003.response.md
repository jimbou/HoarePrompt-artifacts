Output State: **The value of pos is the index of the first occurrence of k in arr, or -1 if k is not found in arr, low is 0, high is n - 1, st is an empty set.**

The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively, which are likely used for a binary search algorithm. It also creates an empty set `st`. The value of `pos` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The initial state of `pos` is preserved, indicating the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
