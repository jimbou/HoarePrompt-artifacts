Functionality: **This function searches for a target value k in a list of distinct integers arr. It first finds the index of the first occurrence of k in arr, then performs a binary search to locate the same index. If the target value is found at the located index, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 along with the located index plus one and the actual index of the target value plus one. The function modifies the state of the program by printing the results and creating a set of indices of elements compared to the target value during the binary search.**
