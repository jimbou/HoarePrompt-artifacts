Postcondition: **low equals pos, high equals pos, st is a set of indices mid1, mid2, ..., midn, where mid1, mid2, ..., midn are the indices of the elements in arr that were compared to k during the loop executions. If the current value of arr[low] is equal to k, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, arr[low] is not equal to k, 1 is printed, and the value of low + 1 which is pos + 1 and the value of pos + 1 which is pos + 1 are printed.**
