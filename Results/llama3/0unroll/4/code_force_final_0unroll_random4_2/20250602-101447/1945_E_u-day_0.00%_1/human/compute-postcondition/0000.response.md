Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, arr is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order, pos is -1**

The code snippet consists of four lines. The first two lines call functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` and assign their return values to `n`, `k` and `arr`, respectively. The third line initializes a new variable `pos` and assigns it the value -1. 

Since the functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` are not defined in the given code snippet, we cannot determine their exact behavior or the values they return. However, based on the precondition, we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n, and `arr` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. 

The third line introduces a new variable `pos` and assigns it the value -1. This line does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `arr`.

Therefore, after executing the entire code block, the values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and a new variable `pos` is introduced with the value -1.
