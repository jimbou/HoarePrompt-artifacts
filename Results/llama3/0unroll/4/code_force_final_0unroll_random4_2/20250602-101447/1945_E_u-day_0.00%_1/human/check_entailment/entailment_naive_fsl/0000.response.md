Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is:

5
1 2 3 4 5

The program will output:

0

However, the correct output should be:

1
1 3

Because the binary search algorithm will not find the correct position of the number 1 in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] without any swaps.

The program only checks if the number is at the correct position after the binary search, but it does not consider the case where the number is not at the correct position and needs to be swapped. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
