Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a binary search is performed on a permutation of integers to find a target value. The program first finds the index of the target value in the permutation, then performs a binary search to locate the same index. If the target value is found at the located index, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 along with the located index plus one and the actual index of the target value plus one.

The program's logic is correct, and it meets the problem description. The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, and the program handles the cases where the target value is found at the located index and where it is not found correctly.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. In the case where the target value is not found at the located index, the program prints the located index plus one and the actual index of the target value plus one. This is not entirely correct, as the problem statement requires the program to print the indices of the elements that need to be swapped to make the binary search work correctly. The program does not actually perform the swap operation, and it does not print the correct indices.

Despite this issue, the program's logic is correct, and it meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
