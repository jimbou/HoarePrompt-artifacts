Output: **low = pos, high = pos, st = {mid1, mid2, ..., midn}, where mid1, mid2, ..., midn are the indices of the elements in arr that were compared to k during the loop executions, and arr[low] is not equal to k, and 1 is printed, and the value of low + 1 which is pos + 1 and the value of pos + 1 which is pos + 1 are being printed**
