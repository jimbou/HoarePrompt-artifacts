Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2.  For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the array using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
3.  It then iterates over the range of possible integers (from 0 to `n`, inclusive) and checks if each integer is present in the array.
4.  If an integer is not present in the array, it prints that integer as the smallest missing positive integer and breaks the loop.
5.  If an integer is present in the array but appears only once, and it's not the first occurrence of a single-count integer, it prints that integer as the first integer that appears only once in the list and breaks the loop.
6.  If all integers appear more than once, it prints the smallest positive integer not present in the array.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
