This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains a list of integers. It identifies and prints the smallest missing positive integer in each list. If no positive integers are missing, it prints the first integer that appears only once in the list. If all integers appear more than once, it prints the smallest positive integer not present in the list.
