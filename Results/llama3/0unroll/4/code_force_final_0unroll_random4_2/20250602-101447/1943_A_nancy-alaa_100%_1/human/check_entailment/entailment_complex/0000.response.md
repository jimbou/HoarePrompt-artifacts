Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob on an array of integers. The game's score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array c, which is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.

The program uses a Counter object from the collections module to count the frequency of each integer in the input array. It then iterates over the range of possible integers (from 0 to n, where n is the size of the input array) and checks if each integer is present in the Counter object. If an integer is not present, it prints that integer as the final score and breaks the loop.

If all integers from 0 to n are present in the Counter object, the program checks if any integer has a frequency of 1. If it finds such an integer, it prints that integer as the final score. This is because, according to the problem statement, if all integers appear more than once, the final score is the smallest positive integer that is not in the array.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
