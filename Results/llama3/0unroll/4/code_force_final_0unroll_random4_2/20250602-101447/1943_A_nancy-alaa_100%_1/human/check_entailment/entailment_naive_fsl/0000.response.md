Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score. The program uses a Counter to count the frequency of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n. If a number is not present in the array, it prints that number as the score. If a number is present only once and it's not the first number, it prints that number as the score. This is because Alice can choose the number that appears only once and Bob can't remove it, so the MEX of the array will be the smallest number that is not present in the array.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. If the array contains all numbers from 0 to n, the program will print n+1 as the score, which is correct. If the array contains a number that appears only once, the program will print that number as the score, which is correct. If the array contains a number that appears more than once, the program will print the smallest number that is not present in the array as the score, which is correct.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
