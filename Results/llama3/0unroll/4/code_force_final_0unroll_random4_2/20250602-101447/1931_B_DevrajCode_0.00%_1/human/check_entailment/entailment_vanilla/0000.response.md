Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using a specific operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases `n` and the amounts of water in each container `a`.

2. The program defines a function `func_1(n, a)` that takes the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water `a` as input.

3. Inside the function, it calculates the total amount of water `total_water` by summing up all the elements in `a`.

4. It then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If it's not, the function returns 'No' because it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

5. If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the function calculates the target amount of water `target` for each container by dividing the total amount of water by `n`.

6. The function then iterates over the amounts of water in each container. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount `water - target`. This difference is added to a variable `container`.

7. If the value of `container` becomes negative at any point during the iteration, the function returns 'No' because it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

8. If the function completes the iteration without returning 'No', it means that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'Yes'.

The program then calls the `func_1(n, a)` function with the input data and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
