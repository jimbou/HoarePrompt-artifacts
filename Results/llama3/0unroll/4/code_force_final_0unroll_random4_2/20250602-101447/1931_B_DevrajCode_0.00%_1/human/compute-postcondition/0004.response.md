Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, total_water is the sum of a, the sum of a is divisible by n, total_water is divisible by n, target is the integer division of total_water by n, and container is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `total_water` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code introduces two new variables: `target` and `container`. The value of `target` is calculated as the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, which is a whole number because `total_water` is divisible by `n` as per the initial state. The variable `container` is initialized to 0.
