Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` takes the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a` as input, calculates the total water and the target amount for each container, and then iterates through the list to check if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

The key insight here is that the program correctly handles the constraint that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, which ensures that the target amount is an integer. The program also correctly checks if the amount of water in each container can be made equal to the target amount by pouring water from one container to another, without violating the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` is 1 or where the amount of water in each container is already equal to the target amount. Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is "YES" for all test cases that meet the problem's constraints.
