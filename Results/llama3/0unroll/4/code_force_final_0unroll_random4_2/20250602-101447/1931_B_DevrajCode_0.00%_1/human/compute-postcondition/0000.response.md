Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, and the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`**.

In this output state, the value of `total_water` is equal to the sum of the elements in list `a`, which is also divisible by `n`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
