Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program first calculates the total amount of water and checks if it's divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because the problem states that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
2.  It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have by dividing the total water by `n`.
3.  The program iterates through the list of water levels `a`. For each container, it subtracts the target amount from the current water level and adds the result to a running total `container`. This effectively calculates the total amount of water that needs to be moved from the current container to the next containers.
4.  If at any point the running total `container` becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target level. In this case, the program immediately returns 'No', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly.
5.  If the program finishes iterating through the list without returning 'No', it means that it's possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'Yes'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
