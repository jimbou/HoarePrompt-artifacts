Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program returns 'No', which is correct because the problem states that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

2. If the total water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the list of containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. This difference is added to the `container` variable.

4. If at any point the `container` variable becomes negative, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

5. If the program iterates over all containers without the `container` variable becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'. This is correct because it means that there is enough water in the previous containers to fill all containers to the target amount.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the number of containers is 1, in which case it returns 'Yes' because there is only one container and it already has the target amount of water.

7. The program also correctly handles the case where the target amount of water is 0, in which case it returns 'Yes' because all containers can be filled to the target amount of 0.

Correctness: **True**
