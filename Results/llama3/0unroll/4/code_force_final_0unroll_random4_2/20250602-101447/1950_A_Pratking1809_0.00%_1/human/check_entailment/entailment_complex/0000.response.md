Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `q` correctly and iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. The program checks the conditions for a stair and a peak correctly:
	* For a stair, it checks if `a < b < c`, which is the correct condition.
	* For a peak, it checks if `a < b > c`, which is also the correct condition.
4. The program prints the correct output for each test case:
	* If the digits form a stair, it prints "STAIR".
	* If the digits form a peak, it prints "PEAK".
	* Otherwise, it prints "NONE".
5. The program does not modify any external state or return any value, only producing output to the console as required.

The only minor issue is that the variable `mn` is declared but not used anywhere in the program. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
