Output State: **q is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, mn is 100, stdin contains t lines each containing three digits a, b, c (0 <= a, b, c <= 9).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `q`. Since `t` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `q` becomes an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The second line assigns the value 100 to `mn`. No other variables are affected. The state of stdin remains the same, containing `t` lines each containing three digits `a`, `b`, `c` (0 <= `a`, `b`, `c` <= 9).
