Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, as one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The remaining test cases still contain three integers n, a, and b, each within the range of 1 to 10^9.
