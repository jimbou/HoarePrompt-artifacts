This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b. It then calculates and prints the result of a mathematical expression based on the values of a and b relative to n. The function handles three cases: when b is less than or equal to a, when b minus a is greater than or equal to n, and when b minus a is less than n. For each test case, it prints the calculated result, and it continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
