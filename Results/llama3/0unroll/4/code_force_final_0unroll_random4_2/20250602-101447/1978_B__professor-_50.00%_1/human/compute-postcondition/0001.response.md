Output State: **The loop will execute 't' times, and for each iteration, it will print the calculated value based on the conditions. The output will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding test case. The value of 't' will be decremented by 1 after each iteration, and the stdin will be empty after the loop finishes executing.**
