Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is less than n-1. In this case, the program prints n-1, but it should print n. This is because if k is less than n-1, Dominater cannot destroy enough bridges to isolate any island, so Everule can still visit all n islands.

For example, if n = 4 and k = 1, the program prints 3, but the correct answer is 4. This is because Dominater can only destroy one bridge, but there are still multiple paths for Everule to visit all 4 islands.
