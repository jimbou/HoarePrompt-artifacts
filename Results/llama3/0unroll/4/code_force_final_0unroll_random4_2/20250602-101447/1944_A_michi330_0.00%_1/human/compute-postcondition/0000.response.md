The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case containing two integers n and k, the first integer is assigned to `t`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. Each test case contains two integers n and k such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2.**
