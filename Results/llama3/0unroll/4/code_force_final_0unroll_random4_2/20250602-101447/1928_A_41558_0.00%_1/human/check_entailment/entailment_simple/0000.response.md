Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it's not possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.
2. If `a` is twice `b` or vice versa, it's not possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'NO'.
3. In all other cases, it's possible to form another rectangle, so the program prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each pair of integers `(a, b)` in the input.

Correctness: **True**
