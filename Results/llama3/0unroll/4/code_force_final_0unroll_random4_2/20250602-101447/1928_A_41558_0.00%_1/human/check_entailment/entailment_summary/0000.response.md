Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the a x b rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then forming a new rectangle from these two rectangles.

The program first checks if both a and b are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because it is not possible to form another rectangle from two odd-sized rectangles.

Next, the program checks if one of the dimensions is exactly twice the other (i.e., a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a). If this condition is met, it prints 'NO' because the resulting rectangles would be the same as the original rectangle.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle from the a x b rectangle.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
