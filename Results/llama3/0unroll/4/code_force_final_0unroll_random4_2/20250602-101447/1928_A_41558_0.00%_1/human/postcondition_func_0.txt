This function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing two integers a and b. It then evaluates each pair (a, b) based on two conditions: (1) if both a and b are odd, or (2) if one is exactly twice the other. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify the input values or retain any information after execution, solely providing a yes/no assessment for each input pair.
