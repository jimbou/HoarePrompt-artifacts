Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. It checks two conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "NO" because it's not possible to form another rectangle.
2. If `a` is twice `b` or vice versa, it prints "NO" because the only possible cut would result in the same rectangle.
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES" because it's possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the examples provided in the problem description. It's a simple and efficient solution that accurately solves the problem.
