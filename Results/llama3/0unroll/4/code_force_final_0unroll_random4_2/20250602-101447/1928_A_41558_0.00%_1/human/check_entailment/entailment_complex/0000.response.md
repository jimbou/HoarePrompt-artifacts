Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if a rectangle of size a x b can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The program checks two conditions:

1. If both a and b are odd, it is not possible to form a different rectangle, so it prints 'NO'.
2. If one side is exactly twice the other (a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a), it is also not possible to form a different rectangle, so it prints 'NO'.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases. It also correctly handles the case where the input values are equal (a == b), which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement but is still a valid input.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
