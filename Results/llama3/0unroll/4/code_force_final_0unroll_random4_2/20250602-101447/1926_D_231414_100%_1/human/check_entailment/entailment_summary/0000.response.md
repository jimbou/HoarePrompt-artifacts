Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of integers in each test case.
2.  It initializes a dictionary `dic` to keep track of the counts of each integer and its XOR complement.
3.  For each integer in the input, it performs a bitwise XOR operation with the predefined constant `check` (2^31 - 1) to find its complement.
4.  If the integer is already in the dictionary, it decrements its count. If the count becomes zero, it removes the integer from the dictionary.
5.  If the integer is not in the dictionary, it checks if its complement is in the dictionary. If not, it adds the complement to the dictionary with a count of 1 and increments the answer `ans`.
6.  Finally, it prints the total count of integers that have a complement in the dictionary, which represents the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. The use of a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each integer and its XOR complement is efficient and effective.

Correctness: **True**
