Output State: **times is an integer, check is 2147483647, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

In this output state, the variable "times" is assigned the value of the first input from stdin, which is an integer representing the number of integers in the test case. The variable "check" is assigned the value of 2^31 - 1, which is 2147483647. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been processed, so it contains one less test case than initially.
