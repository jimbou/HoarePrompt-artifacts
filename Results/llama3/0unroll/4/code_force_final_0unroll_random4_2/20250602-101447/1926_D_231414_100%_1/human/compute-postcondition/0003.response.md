Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the number of integers in the test case) followed by a list of non-negative integers. It then processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers, performing bitwise XOR operations with a predefined constant (2^31 - 1), and maintaining a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each integer and its XOR complement. The function outputs the total count of integers that have a complement in the dictionary, effectively counting the number of pairs of integers that XOR to the predefined constant. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.**
