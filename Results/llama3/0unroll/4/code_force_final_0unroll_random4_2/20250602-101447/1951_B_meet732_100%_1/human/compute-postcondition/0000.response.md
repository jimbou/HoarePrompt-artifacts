Output State: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are pairwise distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, x is an integer equal to a_k, ind is an empty list, c is 0**

In this output state, the list `a` remains unchanged, still containing the first two elements `n` and `k`, followed by the `n` pairwise distinct integers. The variable `x` has been assigned the value of the `k`-th element of list `a`, which is an integer. The list `ind` has been initialized as an empty list, and the variable `c` has been set to 0.
