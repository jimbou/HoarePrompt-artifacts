Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve. The function `func_1` is trying to find the maximum number of wins by comparing the cow's rating with the ratings of other cows, but it does not correctly handle the case when the cow's rating is not the highest.

One example where the program does not work correctly is when the input is:

```
3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
```

The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `2`. The cow with rating `12` can win two matches if it is swapped with the cow with rating `10`.

The program's logic is flawed because it only considers the case when the cow's rating is the highest, and it does not correctly handle the case when the cow's rating is not the highest. The program needs to be modified to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve.
