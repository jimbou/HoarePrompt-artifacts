Postcondition: **a is a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and k, and the remaining n elements are pairwise distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, x is an integer equal to a_k, ind is a list containing exactly one index i where a_i > x, c is an integer equal to the number of elements in ind, which is 1, and the current value of ind[0] is 0, indicating that the first element of the list a is greater than x.**
