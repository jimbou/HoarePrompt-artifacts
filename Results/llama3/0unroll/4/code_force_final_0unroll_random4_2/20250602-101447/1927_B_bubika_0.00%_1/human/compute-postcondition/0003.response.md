Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer (n) and a list of n non-negative integers. It then maps each integer in the list to a corresponding character in the alphabet (a-z), where the mapping is determined by the current value of the integer in a list (b). The function prints the resulting string of characters for each test case, effectively decoding the input integers into a string. The function continues this process until all test cases have been read from standard input, leaving the input stream empty.**
