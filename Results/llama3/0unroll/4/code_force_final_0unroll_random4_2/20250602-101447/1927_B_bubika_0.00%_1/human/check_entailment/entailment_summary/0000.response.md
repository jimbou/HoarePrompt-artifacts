Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the logic to decode the input integers into a string, where each integer in the list corresponds to a character in the alphabet (a-z). The program uses a list (b) to keep track of the current value of each integer, which determines the mapping of integers to characters. The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the resulting string of characters for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
