Output State: **a is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', b is a list of 26 zeros, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer and then a list of integers. The integer is a positive integer and represents the length of the list. The list consists of non-negative integers. The sum of the lengths of all lists does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

The code initializes two variables, `a` and `b`, but does not modify the state of the input (stdin). The variable `a` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `b` is assigned a list of 26 zeros. The state of stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases with two inputs each: a positive integer representing the length of a list, followed by a list of non-negative integers.
