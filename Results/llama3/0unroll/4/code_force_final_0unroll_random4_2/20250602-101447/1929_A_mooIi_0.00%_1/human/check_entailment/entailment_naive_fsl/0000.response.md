Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, but the program simply sorts the array and prints it. The program does not calculate the sum of the differences.

For example, if the input is [2, 1, 3], the program will output [1, 2, 3], but the correct output should be 2, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

The correct program should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
