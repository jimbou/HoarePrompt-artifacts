Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem asks for the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted integers, without calculating the sum of the differences.

The correct solution would be to calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which can be done by iterating over the sorted array and adding the differences to a running total.

Correctness: **False**
