Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The provided program sorts the array in ascending order and then prints the sorted array. However, it does not calculate the beauty of the array.

To calculate the beauty of the array, we need to find the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This can be done by iterating over the sorted array and adding the difference between each element and its previous element to a running total.

The program does not perform this calculation, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
