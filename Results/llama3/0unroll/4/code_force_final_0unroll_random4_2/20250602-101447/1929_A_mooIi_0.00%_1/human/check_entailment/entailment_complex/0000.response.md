Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To maximize the beauty, the elements should be arranged in ascending order, so that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The given program sorts the input array in ascending order and prints the sorted elements. However, it does not calculate the beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program's output is the sorted array, not the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
