Reasoning:
The provided Python program is incorrect based on the given problem description. The problem asks to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, the program only sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, but it does not calculate the sum of the differences.

The correct program should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array and print the result. Here is a corrected version of the program:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

Correctness: **False**
