#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of zeros in the corresponding test case after the operations are performed. The list will have a length of `t`, where `t` is the number of test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers. It then performs a series of operations on the list of integers based on the value of k, and prints the number of zeros in the list after the operations are performed. The function handles various special cases and edge conditions, and returns a list of integers representing the number of zeros in each test case.
