Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers. It then performs a series of operations on the list of integers based on the value of k, and prints the number of zeros in the list after the operations are performed. The function handles various special cases and edge conditions, and returns a list of integers representing the number of zeros in each test case.**
