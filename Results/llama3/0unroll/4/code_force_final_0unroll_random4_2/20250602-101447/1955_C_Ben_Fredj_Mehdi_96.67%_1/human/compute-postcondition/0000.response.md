The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The standard input now contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

The values of `n`, `k`, and `a_i` are not yet known, as they are part of the test cases that have not been read yet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.**
