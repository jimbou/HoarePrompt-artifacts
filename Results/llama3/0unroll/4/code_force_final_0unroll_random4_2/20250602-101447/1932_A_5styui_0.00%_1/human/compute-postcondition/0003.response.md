Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters (representing coins) in each string and prints the count. The function repeats this process for all test cases, ignoring '*' characters (representing thorns) and '.' characters (representing empty cells). After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.**
