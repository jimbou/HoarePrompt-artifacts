Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains a - 1 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first character of the string is '.'.**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases, after reading the first integer, there are `t - 1` test cases left in stdin. The second line initializes `s` to 0. No other variables are affected by the code.
