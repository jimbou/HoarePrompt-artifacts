Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is:

    1
    5 4
    10011
    1110

The program will output 2, which is correct. However, if the input is:

    1
    3 5
    100
    11010

The program will output 2, but the correct output is 3. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the subsequence is not contiguous in the second string.

The issue is with the line `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1`, which assumes that the subsequence will always be contiguous in the second string. However, this is not always the case. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle non-contiguous subsequences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        idx = 0
        for j in range(b):
            try:
                idx = e.index(d[j], idx) + 1
                k += 1
            except ValueError:
                break
        print(k)
```

This corrected version uses the `index` method with a starting index to find the next occurrence of the character in the second string, and increments the starting index accordingly. This correctly handles non-contiguous subsequences.
