This function takes no parameters and returns a list of integers. It converts a string of space-separated integers returned by another function, func_1(), into a list of integers, where each integer is a result of the conversion. The function does not modify any input variables, as it does not accept any. The final state of the program is that it returns a list of integers, which are the converted results from the string returned by func_1().
