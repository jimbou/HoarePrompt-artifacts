Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the cases where the direction of the throw is known ('0' or '1') and where it is unknown ('?'). The program also correctly calculates the possible positions of the ball after each throw, taking into account the clockwise and counterclockwise directions.

The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions of the ball, which is an efficient way to handle the problem. It also correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown to a position that is equivalent to 0 (i.e., the last position in the circle), by discarding 0 and adding the total number of players to the set.

The program also correctly prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves, as required by the problem statement.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem statement work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
