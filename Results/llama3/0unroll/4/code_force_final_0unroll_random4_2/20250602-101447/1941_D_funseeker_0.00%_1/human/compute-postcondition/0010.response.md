Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the number of unique values and the values themselves of the expression (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n, where x is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, and ri is a value obtained from an external function. If the result set contains 0, it is replaced with n. The function takes no arguments and returns no value, but instead prints the count and the values of the unique results.**
