The code prints all unique values in the set `ans`. The set `ans` contains all possible values of `(x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n` and `(x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n`, where `ri` is the value of `r` in the `i`th iteration of the loop. If `0` is in the set `ans`, then the set `ans` contains `n`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values in the set `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output all unique values in the set `ans`.

Output: **all unique values of (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n, where ri is the value of r in the ith iteration of the loop, and if 0 is in the set, then n**
