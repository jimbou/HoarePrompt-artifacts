The code prints the number of unique values in the set `ans`, which contains all possible values of `(x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n` and `(x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n`. The value of `len(ans)` is the number of unique values in the set `ans`.
Output: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n, where ri is the value of r in the ith iteration of the loop. If 0 is in the set ans, then the set ans contains n. The number of unique values in the set ans is being printed**
