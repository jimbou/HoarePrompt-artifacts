Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, x is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= n, ans is a set containing all possible values of (x + r1 + r2 + ... + rm) % n and (x - r1 - r2 - ... - rm) % n, where ri is the value of r in the ith iteration of the loop. The set ans contains n.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line removes the value 0 from the set ans, and the second line adds the value n to the set ans. Since the initial state of ans contains 0, the first line removes this value, leaving the set empty. The second line then adds the value n to the set, resulting in a set containing only the value n. The values of n, m, and x remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.
