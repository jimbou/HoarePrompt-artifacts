Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the possible positions of the ball after m throws. The program uses a set to keep track of the possible positions, which automatically eliminates duplicates. The program also correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The program also correctly handles the case where the ball is thrown to position 0, which is equivalent to position n.

Correctness: **True**
