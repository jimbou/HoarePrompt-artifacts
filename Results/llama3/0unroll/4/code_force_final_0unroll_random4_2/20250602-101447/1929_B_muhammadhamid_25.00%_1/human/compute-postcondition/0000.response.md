Output State: **The output state will contain multiple lines, each containing a single integer. The integer on each line will be the result of the calculation for the corresponding test case. Specifically, for each test case, if k is 1, the output will be 1. If k is less than or equal to 2n, the output will be the ceiling of k divided by 2. If k is greater than 2n, the output will be k divided by 2 plus 1.**
