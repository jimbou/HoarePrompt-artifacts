Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it handles all the potential cases according to the problem description. 

- If k is 1, it prints 1, which is correct because we can color any cell to cover 1 diagonal.
- If k is less than or equal to 2*n, it prints the ceiling of k/2, which is correct because we can color cells on the diagonals to cover k diagonals.
- If k is greater than 2*n, it prints k//2 + 1, which is correct because we need to color at least k//2 + 1 cells to cover k diagonals.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and all the examples provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
