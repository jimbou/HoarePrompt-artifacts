Functionality: **Calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation for multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, if k is 1, the result is 1. If k is less than or equal to 2n, the result is the ceiling of k divided by 2. If k is greater than 2n, the result is k divided by 2 plus 1. The results are printed on separate lines for each test case.**
