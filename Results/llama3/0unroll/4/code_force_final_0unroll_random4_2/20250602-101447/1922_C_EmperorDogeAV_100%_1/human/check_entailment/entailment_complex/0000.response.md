Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum distance between consecutive cities. It checks if the next city is closer than the previous city and sets the distance to 1 if it is. Otherwise, it sets the distance to the difference between the next city and the current city.

2. The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the forward and backward distances. This allows it to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between any two cities.

3. The program correctly handles the queries. If the destination city is to the right of the source city, it uses the prefix sum of the forward distances. If the destination city is to the left of the source city, it uses the prefix sum of the backward distances.

4. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the source and destination cities are the same.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
