Output State: **The program returns a list of (n-1) integers, where each element is either 1 or the difference between the next city and the current city, based on the list of n non-negative integers in ascending order.**

In this output state, the returned list `prog_cities` contains (n-1) integers, where each element is calculated as the difference between the next city and the current city in the `cities` list. Since `cities` is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, the differences will be non-negative integers. The list `prog_cities` will have one less element than the original `cities` list, as it represents the differences between consecutive cities.
