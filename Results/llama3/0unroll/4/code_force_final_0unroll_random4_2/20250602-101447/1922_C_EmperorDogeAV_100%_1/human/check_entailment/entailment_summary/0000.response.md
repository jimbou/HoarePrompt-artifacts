Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities. The program first calculates the minimum distance or difference between consecutive cities in the forward and backward directions using the `func_1` function. It then calculates the prefix sum of these distances to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between any two cities.

The program handles the cases where the source city is less than the destination city and vice versa correctly by using the prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` respectively.

The `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum distance or difference between consecutive cities by comparing the distance to the previous city and the next city and choosing the smaller one. If the next city is closer, it sets the distance to 1, otherwise it sets the distance to the difference between the next city and the current city.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and the correctness is True.

Correctness: **True**
