Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities based on the given conditions.

The program first calculates the closest city for each city in both forward and backward directions using the `func_1` function. It then calculates the prefix sum of the distances to the closest cities in both directions.

When a query is made to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel from city `a` to city `b`, the program checks if `a` is less than `b`. If it is, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed by subtracting the prefix sum of the distances to the closest cities in the forward direction at index `a-1` from the prefix sum at index `b-1`. If `a` is not less than `b`, it calculates the minimum number of coins needed by subtracting the prefix sum of the distances to the closest cities in the backward direction at index `b-1` from the prefix sum at index `a-1`.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when `a` and `b` are adjacent cities, when `a` is the first city and `b` is the last city, and when `a` is the last city and `b` is the first city.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
