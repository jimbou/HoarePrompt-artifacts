Output State: **cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer, prog_cities is a list of (n-1) zeros**

In this output state, the code has created a new list called prog_cities, which has a length of (n-1) and is filled with zeros. The values of the other variables, cities and n, remain unchanged. The list cities is still a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, and n is still a positive integer.
