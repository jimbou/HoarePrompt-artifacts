Functionality: This function takes a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order and returns a list of (n-1) integers. For each city in the input list, it calculates the difference between the current city and the next city, and if this difference is less than the difference between the current city and the previous city, it sets the corresponding element in the output list to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the difference between the current city and the next city. The function effectively determines the optimal direction (forward or backward) for each city based on the distances to its neighboring cities.
