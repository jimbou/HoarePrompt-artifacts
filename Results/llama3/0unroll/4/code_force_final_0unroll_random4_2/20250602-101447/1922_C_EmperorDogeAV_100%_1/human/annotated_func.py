    #State: Output State: prog_cities is a list of (n-1) integers where each element is either 1 or the difference between the next city and the current city, cities is a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order, n is a positive integer.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list of (n-1) integers, where each element is either 1 or the difference between the next city and the current city, based on the list of n non-negative integers in ascending order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of n non-negative integers in ascending order and returns a list of (n-1) integers. Each element in the returned list is either 1 or the difference between the next city and the current city, depending on which is smaller. The function effectively calculates the minimum distance or difference between consecutive cities in the input list.
