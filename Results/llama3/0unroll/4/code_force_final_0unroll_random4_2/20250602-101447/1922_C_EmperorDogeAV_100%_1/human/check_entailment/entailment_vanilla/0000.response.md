Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of cities, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries. It then processes the queries by calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between the specified cities.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and the main function. The `func_1` function calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to the next city in the forward direction. It does this by comparing the distance between the current city and the next city with the distance between the current city and the previous city. If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, it sets the minimum number of coins to 1, otherwise, it sets it to the distance between the current city and the next city.

The main function first calls `func_1` to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel in the forward direction. It then reverses the list of cities and calls `func_1` again to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel in the backward direction. It then calculates the prefix sum of the minimum number of coins required to travel in both directions.

Finally, the program processes the queries by checking if the destination city is to the right or left of the source city. If it is to the right, it calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel by subtracting the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city in the forward direction. If it is to the left, it calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel by subtracting the prefix sum of the source city from the prefix sum of the destination city in the backward direction.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all the edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
