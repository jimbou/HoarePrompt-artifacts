Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the cost of traveling from one city to the next. It checks if the next city is closer than the previous city, and if so, sets the cost to 1. Otherwise, it sets the cost to the difference between the next city and the current city.

2. The program correctly calculates the prefix sums of the forward and backward costs. This allows it to efficiently calculate the total cost of traveling from one city to another.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the destination city is to the right of the source city, and the case where the destination city is to the left of the source city.

4. The program correctly prints the minimum number of coins needed to travel from the source city to the destination city.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it does so efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
