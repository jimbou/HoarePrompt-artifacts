Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer less than or equal to N, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to N, L is a list of M1 positive integers, R is a list of M2 positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or both, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M1 is greater than 1, then the current value of i is R[0] + 1, the current value of cur is 1, the current value of ans is the number of combinations of N-1 items taken L[-1]-1 at a time, and the current value of nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. If M1 is 1, then the values of i, cur, nums_left, and ans remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
