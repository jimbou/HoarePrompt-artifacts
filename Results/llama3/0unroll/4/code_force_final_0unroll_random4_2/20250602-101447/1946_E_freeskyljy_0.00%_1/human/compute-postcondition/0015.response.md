Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer less than or equal to N, M2 is a positive integer less than or equal to N, L is a list of M1 positive integers, R is a list of M2 positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the first element of R is N. Either M1 is 1 or M2 is 1 or both, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M1 is greater than 1, then i is 1, cur is 0, ans is the number of combinations of N-1 items taken L[-1]-1 at a time, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. If M1 is 1, then the values of i, cur, nums_left, and ans remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `nums_left` has been updated to `N - R[0] - 1`. This means that `nums_left` now holds the value of `N` minus the first element of `R` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
