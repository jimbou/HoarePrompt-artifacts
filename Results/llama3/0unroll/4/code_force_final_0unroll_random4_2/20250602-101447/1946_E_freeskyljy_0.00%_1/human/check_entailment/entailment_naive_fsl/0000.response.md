Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. It checks for the conditions mentioned in the problem description, such as the last prefix maximum being equal to the first suffix maximum, and the first prefix maximum being 1 and the last suffix maximum being N. It also handles the cases where M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 correctly.

The program uses the math.comb function to calculate the number of combinations, which is correct. It also uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result is within the range of 10^9 + 7.

The program iterates through the prefix and suffix maximums correctly, and it handles the cases where the current index is equal to the prefix or suffix maximum correctly.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
