Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer less than or equal to N, M2 is a positive integer less than or equal to N, L is a list of M1 positive integers, R is a list of M2 positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of N, M1, and M2 are determined by the first line of the input, which assigns these values from the input. The lists L and R are populated with positive integers from the second and third lines of the input, respectively. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one, as one test case has been processed.
