Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer less than or equal to N, M2 is a positive integer less than or equal to N, L is a list of M1 positive integers, R is a list of M2 positive integers. If M2 is greater than 1, then i is set to N, cur is set to M2, nums_left is set to 0, and ans is set to (N-1)! / (L[-1]-1)!. Otherwise, the values of i, cur, nums_left, and ans remain unchanged.***
