Output State: **i = N, cur = M2, nums_left = 0, ans = (N-1)! / (L[-1]-1)!**.

The output state is reached after the loop executes all the iterations. The value of i is now equal to N, indicating that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list R. The value of cur is now equal to M2, which means that the loop has processed all the elements in the list R. The value of nums_left is now 0, indicating that all the elements in the list R have been processed. The value of ans is now equal to the number of combinations of N-1 items taken L[-1]-1 at a time, which is calculated using the formula (N-1)! / (L[-1]-1)!.
