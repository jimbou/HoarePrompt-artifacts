Output State: **i is 1, cur is 0, nums_left is 0, ans is the number of combinations of N-1 items taken L[-1]-1 at a time.**

In this output state, the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The variable i has reached 1, cur has reached 0, and nums_left has reached 0. The variable ans now holds the value of the number of combinations of N-1 items taken L[-1]-1 at a time, which is the result of the loop's execution.
