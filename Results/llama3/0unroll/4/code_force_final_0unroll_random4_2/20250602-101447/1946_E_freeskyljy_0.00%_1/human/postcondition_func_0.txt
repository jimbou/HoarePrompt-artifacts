This function calculates the number of combinations of N-1 items taken L[-1]-1 at a time, where N is a positive integer, and L is a list of M1 positive integers. It takes as input three lines of integers from standard input: the first line contains three integers N, M1, and M2, and the second and third lines contain M1 and M2 positive integers, respectively. The function returns 0 if the last element of L is not equal to the first element of R, or if the first element of L is not 1 or the first element of R is not N, or if M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1 and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R. Otherwise, it returns the calculated number of combinations.
