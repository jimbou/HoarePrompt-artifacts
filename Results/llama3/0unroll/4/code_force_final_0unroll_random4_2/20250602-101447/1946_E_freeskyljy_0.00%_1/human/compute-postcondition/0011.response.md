Postcondition: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to N, M2 is a positive integer less than or equal to N, L is a list of M1 positive integers, R is a list of M2 positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the first element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a positive integer equal to the number of combinations of N-1 items taken L[-1]-1 at a time, cur is a positive integer equal to M1-2.**
