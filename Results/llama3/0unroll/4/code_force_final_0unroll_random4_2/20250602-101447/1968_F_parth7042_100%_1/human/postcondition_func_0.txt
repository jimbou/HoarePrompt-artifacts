This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains an integer t, two integers n and q, and a list of n integers. It then processes q queries for each test case, each query containing two integers l and r. The function checks if there exists an index i such that l <= i <= r and the prefix XOR of the list of integers at index i is equal to the XOR of the prefix XOR at index r and the prefix XOR at index l-1. If such an index exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints the results list, where each result is separated by a newline character.
