Output State: **t is an integer equal to the first input, index is 1, results is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases with two fewer inputs than before**.

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code has read the first input from stdin, which is an integer, and assigned it to the variable `t`. The `index` variable has been incremented to 1, indicating that the next input to be read is the second one. The `results` list has been initialized as an empty list. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, but each test case has two fewer inputs than before, as the first two inputs (the integer `t` and the next input) have already been read.
