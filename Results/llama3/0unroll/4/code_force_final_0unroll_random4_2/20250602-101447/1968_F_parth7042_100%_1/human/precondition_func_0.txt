stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer t, then two integers n and q, and then a list of n integers. For each test case, there are q queries, each query containing two integers l and r. All integers are non-negative, 1 <= t <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= a_i < 2^30, 1 <= l < r <= n.
