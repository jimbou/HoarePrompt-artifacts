Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string s is split into two parts at index x + 1 and both parts are being printed. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, then if x is either 1 or n // 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first x + 2 characters of s and the rest of the string s are printed.***
