Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is -1**.

The first line assigns the input string to `s`, replacing its original value. The second line calculates the length of the new string `s` and assigns it to `n`. The third line assigns the value -1 to `x`. The initial state of `s` being a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters remains valid after the code execution.
