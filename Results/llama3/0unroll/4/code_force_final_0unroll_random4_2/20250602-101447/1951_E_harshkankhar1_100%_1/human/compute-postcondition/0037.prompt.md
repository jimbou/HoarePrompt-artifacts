You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with 'YES' printed, 1 printed, and the string s printed. The value of x remains -1, and the value of func_1(s[0:]) remains False. The length of string s is still n.
    #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is -1, and func_1(s[0:]) is True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: a string consisting of a sequence of the same character (the first character of s) repeated x + 1 times, followed by a space, followed by the remaining characters of s after the character at index x
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO

            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: The substring of s from the beginning to the index of the first character that is different from the first character of s plus 2, followed by a space, followed by the substring of s from the index of the first character that is different from the first character of s plus 2 to the end of the string
        #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1, and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True. If x is either 1 or n // 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first x + 2 characters of s and the rest of the string s are printed.
    #State: *s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, then 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the string s is split into two parts at index x + 1 and both parts are being printed. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, then if x is either 1 or n // 2, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, 2 is printed, and the first x + 2 characters of s and the rest of the string s are printed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the program remains unchanged, with 'YES' printed, 1 printed, and the string s printed. The value of x remains -1, and the value of func_1(s[0:]) remains False. The length of string s is still n.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.

Case_3: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1. The current value of func_1(s[x + 1:]) is False, and 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and the string s is split into two parts at index x + 1 and both parts are being printed

Case_4: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, n is the length of s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True, and x is not equal to -1, and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True, and x is neither 1 nor n // 2, and 'YES' is printed, and 2 is printed, and the first x + 2 characters of s and the rest of the string s are printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
