Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. 

`func_2` takes a string as input and checks if it meets certain conditions. If the string is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '1', and returns the original string. If the string consists of the same character repeated throughout, it finds the index of the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. If the index is found, it checks if the substring after this index is a palindrome. If it is not, it prints 'YES', '2', and splits the string into two parts at the index. If the substring is a palindrome and the index is not 1 or half the length of the string, it prints 'YES', '2', and splits the string into two parts at the index plus 2. If the index is 1 or half the length of the string, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies strings that are already non-palindromes, strings that can be partitioned into non-palindromes, and strings that cannot be partitioned into non-palindromes. 

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
