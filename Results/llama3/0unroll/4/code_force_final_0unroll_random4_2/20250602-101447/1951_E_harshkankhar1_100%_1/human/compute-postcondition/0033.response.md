Based on the precondition, let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
2. `n` is the length of `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`. This means that `s[x]` is the first character that is not equal to `s[0]`.
4. `func_1(s[0:])` is True, which means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the entire string `s`.
5. `x` is not equal to -1, which means that `x` is a valid index in the string `s`.
6. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, which means that the function `func_1` returns True when applied to the substring of `s` starting from index `x + 1`.
7. `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, which means that `x` is not equal to 1 and not equal to half the length of `s`.
8. 'YES' is printed, which means that the previous conditions are met.
9. 2 is printed, which is a separate print statement.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])`

This statement prints two parts:

1. `s[:x + 2]`: This is the substring of `s` from the beginning to index `x + 2`. Since `x` is the index of the first character that is different from the first character of `s`, this substring includes the first character that is different from the first character of `s`, and one more character.
2. `s[x + 2:]`: This is the substring of `s` from index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

The output will be the concatenation of these two substrings, separated by a space.

Output: **The substring of s from the beginning to the index of the first character that is different from the first character of s plus 2, followed by a space, followed by the substring of s from the index of the first character that is different from the first character of s plus 2 to the end of the string**
