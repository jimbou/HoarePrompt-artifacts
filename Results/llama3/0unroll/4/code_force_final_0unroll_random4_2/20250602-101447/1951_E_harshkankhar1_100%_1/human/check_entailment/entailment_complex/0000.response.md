Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 

`func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. 

`func_2` takes a string as input and checks if it can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes. If the string itself is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '1', and the original string. If the string consists of the same character repeated throughout, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it finds the index of the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If the substring after this index is not a palindrome, it prints 'YES', '2', and splits the string into two parts at the index. If the substring is a palindrome and the index is not 1 or half the length of the string, it prints 'YES', '2', and splits the string into two parts at the index plus 2. If the index is 1 or half the length of the string, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
