This function takes a string of lowercase Latin characters as input and checks if it meets certain conditions. If the string consists of the same character repeated throughout, it prints 'YES' and '1' and returns the original string. If the string does not meet this condition, it finds the index of the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. If the index is found, it checks if the substring after this index meets the same condition as the original string. If it does not, it prints 'YES', '2', and splits the string into two parts at the index. If the substring meets the condition and the index is not 1 or half the length of the string, it prints 'YES', '2', and splits the string into two parts at the index plus 2. If the index is 1 or half the length of the string, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
