Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a given string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program first checks if the input string itself is not a palindrome. If it is not, the program prints "YES", 1, and the string itself as the partition. 

If the input string is a palindrome, the program then checks for the first character in the string that is different from the first character. If no such character is found, the program prints "NO" as it is not possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

If a different character is found, the program then checks if the substring after this character is not a palindrome. If it is not, the program prints "YES", 2, and the string split into two parts at the index of the different character plus one.

If the substring after the different character is a palindrome, the program then checks if the index of the different character is either 1 or half the length of the string. If it is, the program prints "NO" as it is not possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, the program prints "YES", 2, and the string split into two parts at the index of the different character plus two.

The program's logic is correct and it handles all possible cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
