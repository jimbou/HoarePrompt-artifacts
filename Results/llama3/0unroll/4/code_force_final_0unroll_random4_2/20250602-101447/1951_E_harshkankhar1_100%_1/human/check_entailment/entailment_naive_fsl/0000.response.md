Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string has a length of 2 and is not a palindrome. For example, if the input is "ab", the program will print "NO" instead of "YES" with the partition ["a", "b"].

In the function `func_2`, the condition `if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:` is not sufficient to handle this case. The program should also check if the length of the substring `s[x + 1:]` is greater than 1, because a single character is always a palindrome.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the input string has a length of 1. In this case, the program will print "NO" instead of "YES" with the partition [the single character].

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to handle these edge cases correctly.
