Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions: `func_1` to check if a string is a palindrome, and `func_2` to find a valid partition of the input string.

In `func_2`, the program first checks if the entire input string is not a palindrome. If it's not, the program prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.

If the entire string is a palindrome, the program then checks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string. If no such character is found, the program prints "NO" because it's not possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

If a different character is found, the program checks if the substring starting from that character is not a palindrome. If it's not, the program prints "YES" and the partition into two substrings.

If the substring starting from the different character is a palindrome, the program checks if the different character is at the second position or at the middle of the string. If it is, the program prints "NO" because it's not possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

If the different character is not at the second position or at the middle of the string, the program prints "YES" and the partition into two substrings, where the first substring includes the different character and the next character.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
