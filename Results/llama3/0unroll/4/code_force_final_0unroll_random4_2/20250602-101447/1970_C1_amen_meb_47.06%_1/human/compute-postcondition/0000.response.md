Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and t, where n is an integer between 2 and 200000 inclusive and t is 1, then n-1 lines each containing two integers u and v, where u and v are integers between 1 and n inclusive, and finally one integer u, where u is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

In this output state, the code has created an empty list called `numbers`. The stdin still contains the same inputs as before, which are the two integers n and t, followed by n-1 lines of two integers u and v, and finally one integer u.
