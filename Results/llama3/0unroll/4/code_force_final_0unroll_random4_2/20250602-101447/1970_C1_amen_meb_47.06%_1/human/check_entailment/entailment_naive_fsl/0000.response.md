Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The main issue is that the program does not correctly identify the starting node for each round, and it does not perform the game simulation as described in the problem.

The program uses the `func_1()` function to read the input, but this function only reads the edges of the tree and not the starting nodes for each round. The program then tries to compare the number of edges connected to each node, which is not relevant to the game simulation.

A correct implementation would involve reading the starting nodes for each round, simulating the game for each starting node, and determining the winner based on the game simulation. The program does not perform these steps correctly.

For example, if the input is:

```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```

The program will output "Ron", but the correct output should be "Hermione" because the starting node is 3, which is a leaf node, and Hermione will win the game.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
