The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` test cases. After reading the first integer, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5). The second line contains a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5). The second line contains a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
