#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, edges is a list of pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree with n nodes, and start is an integer representing the starting node of the game. The tree represented by edges has exactly two leaves.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: The tree dictionary now represents an adjacency list of the tree with n nodes, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the winner of a game played on a tree with two leaves, where the game starts at a given node. The function takes as input the number of nodes, the edges of the tree, and the starting node, and returns the name of the winner, either 'Ron' or 'Hermione', based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and tree is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: queue is an empty deque, visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree that are reachable from the start node
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, which is an integer value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the shortest distance between a start node and a target node in a tree, returning the distance as an integer if the target node is reachable from the start node, and -1 otherwise.
