Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game played on a tree with two leaves, where the game starts at a given node. The function takes as input the number of nodes, the edges of the tree, and the starting node, and returns the name of the winner, either 'Ron' or 'Hermione', based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the two leaves.**
