Output State: **queue is an empty deque, visited is a set containing all nodes in the tree that are reachable from the start node**.

In this output state, the queue is empty because the loop continues until all nodes in the queue have been processed. The visited set contains all nodes in the tree that are reachable from the start node, because each node is added to the visited set when it is processed, and the loop continues until all reachable nodes have been processed.
