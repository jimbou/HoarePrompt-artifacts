Postcondition: **The tree dictionary still represents an adjacency list of the tree with n nodes, where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes. The leaves list contains all nodes in the tree with only one neighboring node. The dist1 variable stores the shortest distance from the start node to the first leaf node in the leaves list, and the dist2 variable stores the shortest distance from the start node to the second leaf node in the leaves list. The current value of either dist1 or dist2 (or both) is even.**
