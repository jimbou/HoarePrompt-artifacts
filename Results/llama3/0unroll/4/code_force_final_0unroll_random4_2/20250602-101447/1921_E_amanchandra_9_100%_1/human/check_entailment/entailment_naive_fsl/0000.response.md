Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. 

For example, when the input is `10 10 1 6 10 8`, the program outputs "Alice", but the correct output should be "Draw". This is because Alice can move her chip to (2, 5), (2, 6), or (2, 7), and Bob can move his chip to (9, 7), (9, 8), or (9, 9), and neither player can capture the other's chip.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the absolute difference between the columns of the two chips is within a certain range, but it does not consider the actual moves that the players can make. It also does not correctly handle the case where the absolute difference between the rows of the two chips is even.

To correctly determine the outcome of the game, the program should simulate the moves of both players and check if either player can capture the other's chip. If neither player can capture the other's chip, the game is a draw.
