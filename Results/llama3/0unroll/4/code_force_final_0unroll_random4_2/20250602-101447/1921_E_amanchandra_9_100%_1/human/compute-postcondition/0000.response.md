The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) â€” the number of test cases. After accepting the integer, the stdin now contains multiple test cases, but the first line is consumed. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases.**
