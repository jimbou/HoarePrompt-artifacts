This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of pairs of elements in the array that can be made equal to zero by subtracting the same number from both elements, without exceeding k. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
