Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships that were sunk after the Kraken's attack. The program iterates through the ships from both ends, reducing the durability of the ships by the minimum durability of the two ships at the current ends. If the durability of a ship becomes zero, it is counted as sunk. The program also handles the case where the number of attacks is odd, in which case the middle ship is attacked last. The program correctly outputs the number of ships sunk for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
