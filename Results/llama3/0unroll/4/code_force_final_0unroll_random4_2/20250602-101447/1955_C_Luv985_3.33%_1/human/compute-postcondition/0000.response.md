Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= k <= 10^15). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to T. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case consists of two lines, the first line of the code consumes one integer from stdin, leaving multiple test cases minus one. The value of T is now an integer between 1 and 10^4. No other variables are affected.
