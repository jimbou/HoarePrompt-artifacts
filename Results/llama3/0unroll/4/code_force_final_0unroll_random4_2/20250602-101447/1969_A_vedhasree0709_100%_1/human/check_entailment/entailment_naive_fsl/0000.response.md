Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

4
2 3 4 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 3. However, if the input is:

6
2 3 4 5 6 1

The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 4. The program only checks for the case where two friends are each other's best friends, but it does not consider the case where there are more than two pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.

The program should be modified to handle all possible cases, not just the case where two friends are each other's best friends. 

Here is a correct version of the program:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                count += 1
        if count > 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(3)

This version of the program checks for all pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints 2 if it finds any, otherwise it prints 3.
