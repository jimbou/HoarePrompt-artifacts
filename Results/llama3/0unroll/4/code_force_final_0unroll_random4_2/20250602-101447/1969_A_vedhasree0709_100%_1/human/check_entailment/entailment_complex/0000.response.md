Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
3. It then iterates over the list of best friends and checks if there exists a pair of friends `i` and `j` such that `p_i = j` and `p_j = i`. This is done by checking if `l[i]` is equal to `i + 1` and if `l[p - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`.
4. If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that at least 2 friends can be invited to the party.
5. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, indicating that at least 3 friends need to be invited to the party.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the logic is sound. The use of a flag `j` to break out of the loop once a pair is found is also a good optimization.

Correctness: **True**
