Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to have at least 2 friends at his party. 

The program iterates through the list of friends and checks if there exists a pair of friends that are each other's best friends (i.e., p_i = j and p_j = i). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, because Monocarp only needs to send invitations to these two friends. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, because Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least three friends to ensure that at least two of them come to the party.

The program correctly handles the case where the input list contains distinct integers, and it correctly processes multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
