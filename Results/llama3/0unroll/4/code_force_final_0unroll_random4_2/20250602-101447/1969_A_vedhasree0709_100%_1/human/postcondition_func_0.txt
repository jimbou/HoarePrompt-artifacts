This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of distinct integers. It then checks for each test case if there exists a pair of integers that point to each other (i.e., p_i = j and p_j = i). If such a pair is found, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the result for each case.
