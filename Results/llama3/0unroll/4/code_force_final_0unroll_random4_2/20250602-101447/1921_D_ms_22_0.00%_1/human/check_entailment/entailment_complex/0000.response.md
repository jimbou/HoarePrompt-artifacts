Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by rearranging the array c_i to be as different as possible from Petya's array a_i.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of integers n and m, followed by the n integers a_i and m integers b_i.

The program then sorts the array b_i in ascending order.

Next, it creates a max heap and pushes the differences between each a_i and the smallest and largest elements of b_i into the heap.

The program then pops elements from the heap and calculates the absolute difference between the popped element and the smallest or largest element of b_i that has not been used yet.

The program continues this process until the heap is empty, at which point it has calculated the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

The program then prints the maximum total difference D for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
