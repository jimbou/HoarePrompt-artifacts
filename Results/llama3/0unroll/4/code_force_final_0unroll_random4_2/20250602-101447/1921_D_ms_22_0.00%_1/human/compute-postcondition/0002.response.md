Output State: **t = 0, stdin is empty, and the output contains the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each test case.**

In this output state, the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variable `t` has been decremented to 0. The input from `stdin` has been consumed, and the output contains the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each test case. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans`, has been modified according to the loop's execution.
