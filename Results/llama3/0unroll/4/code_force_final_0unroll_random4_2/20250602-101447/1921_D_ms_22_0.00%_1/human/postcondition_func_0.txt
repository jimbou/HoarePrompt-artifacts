This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each a_i and the closest b_i, either from the start or end of the sorted b_i list, and prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input, producing output containing the sum of minimum absolute differences for each test case.
