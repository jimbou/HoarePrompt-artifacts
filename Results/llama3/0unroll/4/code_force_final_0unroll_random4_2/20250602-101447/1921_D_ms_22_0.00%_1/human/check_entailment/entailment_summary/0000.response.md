Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It uses a heap data structure to efficiently find the maximum difference between each element in array a and the closest element in array b, either from the start or end of the sorted b array. The program correctly handles the case where the closest element is at the start or end of the b array, and it updates the pointers tp1 and tp2 accordingly. The program also correctly calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences for each test case and prints the result.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference D. The use of a heap data structure is efficient, and the program's time complexity is O(n log m), where n is the number of elements in array a and m is the number of elements in array b.

Correctness: **True**
