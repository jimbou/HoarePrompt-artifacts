Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read and processed, so the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one. The structure of each test case remains the same, with three lines containing integers n, m, a_i, and b_i, respectively.
