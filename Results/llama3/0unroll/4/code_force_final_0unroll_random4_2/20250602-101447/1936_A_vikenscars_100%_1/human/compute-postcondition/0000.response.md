Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `func_1` is a function that takes four indices `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and returns a string '<', '=', or '>' based on the comparison of (`p_a` | `p_b`) and (`p_c` | `p_d`) where `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `max_item_idx` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `max_item_idx` has been initialized to 0, while the values of `n` and `func_1` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` still takes four indices and returns a string based on the comparison of the permutations, and `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1.
