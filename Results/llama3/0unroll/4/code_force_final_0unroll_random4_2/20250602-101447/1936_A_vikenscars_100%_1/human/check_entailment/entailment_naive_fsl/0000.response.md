Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to interact with the interactor and find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

`func_1` sends a query to the interactor and returns the result, which is either '<', '=', or '>'. This function is used to compare the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.

`func_2` finds the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. It first finds the index with the maximum value by comparing each index with the current maximum index. Then, it finds the pair index by comparing each index with the current pair index. If the result is '<', it updates the pair index. If the result is '=', it checks if the pair index is greater than the current index. If it is, it updates the pair index.

The program handles all potential cases because it uses a systematic approach to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value. It first finds the maximum index, and then finds the pair index by comparing each index with the current pair index. This approach ensures that the program finds the correct pair of indices even if the maximum XOR value is not unique.

The program also handles the case where the maximum XOR value is not unique. In this case, the program returns one of the pairs of indices with the maximum XOR value, which is allowed by the problem description.

Overall, the program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases.
