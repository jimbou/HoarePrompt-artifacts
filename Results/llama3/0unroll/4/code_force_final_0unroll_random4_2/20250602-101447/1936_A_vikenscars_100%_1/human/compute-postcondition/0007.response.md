Output: **`max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation `p` where `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation `p` where `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, and this is printed: "! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]"**
