Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation `p` where `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, `pair_idx` is the index of the maximum value in the permutation `p` where `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is that `pair_idx` is assigned the same value as `max_item_idx`, which is the index of the maximum value in the permutation `p`. The permutation `p` remains unchanged, and it is still a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
