Functionality: **This function finds the index of the maximum value in a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 and prints it along with its pair index. The function iterates through the permutation to find the maximum value and its pair, and then prints the indices of these values. The function assumes that the permutation is represented by a function `func_1` that compares pairs of indices and returns a string '<', '=', or '>' based on the comparison. The function prints the indices of the maximum value and its pair in the format '! max_item_idx pair_idx'.**
