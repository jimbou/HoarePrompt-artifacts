Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a secret sequence `p` such that `p_i XOR p_j` is maximized. The program uses a function `func_1` to ask queries and compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the sequence.

In function `func_2`, the program first finds the index of the maximum value in the sequence `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum. This is done using the `func_1` function to ask queries and determine the maximum value.

Once the maximum value is found, the program then finds the index of the value that, when paired with the maximum value, produces the maximum XOR result. This is done by comparing each element with the current pair and updating the pair if a better XOR result is found.

Finally, the program prints the indices of the maximum value and its pair, which are the indices `i` and `j` that maximize `p_i XOR p_j`.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, where `n` is the length of the sequence `p`, which is within the allowed limit.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
