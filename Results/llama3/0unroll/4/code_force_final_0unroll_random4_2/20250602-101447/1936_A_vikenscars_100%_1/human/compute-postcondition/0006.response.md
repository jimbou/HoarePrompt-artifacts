Based on the precondition, `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are both the index of the maximum value in the permutation `p`. Since `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`, the maximum value in `p` is `n-1`. Therefore, both `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are equal to `n-1`.

The print statement is printing a formatted string with the values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`. The string starts with an exclamation mark and a space, followed by the value of `max_item_idx`, a space, and then the value of `pair_idx`.

Output: **! n-1 n-1 (where n is the length of the permutation p)**
