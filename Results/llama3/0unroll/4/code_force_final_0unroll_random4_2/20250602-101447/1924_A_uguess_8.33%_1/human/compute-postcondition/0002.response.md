Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, k, m) and a string s of length m. It checks if the string s contains at least n substrings of length k, where each substring consists of distinct characters from the first k lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a string of length n, which is a combination of the longest substring found and additional characters to fill the length n. The function processes all test cases and prints the output for each case.**
