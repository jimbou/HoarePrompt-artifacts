Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and m. The second line contains a string s of length m. n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000. s consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines, the first line of each test case contains three integers n, k, and m, and the second line contains a string s of length m. The values of n, k, and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000, and s consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The code does not modify the values of n, k, m, or s, so they remain the same. The only change is that the variable `t` is now assigned the value of the first integer read from the input.
