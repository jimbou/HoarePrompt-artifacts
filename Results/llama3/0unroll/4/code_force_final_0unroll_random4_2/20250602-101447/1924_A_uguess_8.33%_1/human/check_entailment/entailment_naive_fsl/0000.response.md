Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of times a subsequence of length n is found in the string s.
2. It initializes a variable `cur` to keep track of the current subsequence being formed. `cur` is a bitmask where each bit corresponds to a lowercase English alphabet (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25).
3. It iterates through the string s, and for each character, it checks if the corresponding bit in `cur` is set. If not, it sets the bit and increments `cur`.
4. If `cur` becomes equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, it means a subsequence of length n has been found, so it increments `cnt` and resets `cur` to 0.
5. After iterating through the entire string s, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints "YES", indicating that all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s.
6. If `cnt` is less than n, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s. It does this by finding the first character that is not present in the current subsequence (i.e., the first bit that is not set in `cur`) and appending it to the string. It then appends the remaining characters to the string to make it of length n.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s.
* When not all possible strings of length n occur as a subsequence of s, and it correctly constructs a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
