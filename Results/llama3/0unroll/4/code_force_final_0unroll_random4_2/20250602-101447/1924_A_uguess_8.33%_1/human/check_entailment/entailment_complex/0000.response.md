Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of three integers (n, k, m) and a string s of length m.
2.  It initializes variables cnt and cur to keep track of the number of substrings of length k found in s and the current substring being processed, respectively.
3.  The program iterates through each character in the string s. For each character, it checks if the character is not already present in the current substring (cur). If it's not present, it adds the character to the current substring.
4.  If the current substring becomes a complete substring of length k (i.e., cur equals (1 << k) - 1), it increments the cnt variable and resets the current substring.
5.  After processing the entire string s, the program checks if the number of substrings of length k found (cnt) is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length n that does not occur as a subsequence of s.
6.  The constructed string consists of the longest substring found (cnt) followed by a character that is not present in the current substring (tmp) and additional 'a' characters to fill the length n.
7.  The program correctly handles the case where the answer is 'NO' by printing the constructed string.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
