Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string s.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n, k, and m, and the string s.
3. It initializes a counter (cnt) to keep track of the number of substrings of length k found in s, and a variable (cur) to keep track of the current substring being formed.
4. It iterates over each character in s. For each character, it checks if the character is not already present in the current substring (cur). If it's not present, it adds the character to the current substring (cur) and checks if the current substring is complete (i.e., all k characters are present). If it's complete, it increments the counter (cnt) and resets the current substring (cur).
5. After iterating over all characters in s, it checks if the counter (cnt) is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length n can be formed as a subsequence of s.
6. If the counter (cnt) is less than n, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length n that cannot be formed as a subsequence of s. It does this by taking the longest substring found (cnt) and appending additional characters to fill the length n.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
