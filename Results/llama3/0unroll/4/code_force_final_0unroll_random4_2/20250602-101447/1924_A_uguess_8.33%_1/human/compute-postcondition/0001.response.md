Output State: **The loop has executed all the iterations and has printed the output for each test case. The value of t is now 0, and the stdin is empty. The variables n, k, m, s, cnt, and cur are no longer in scope. The output of the program is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' followed by a string for each test case. The string is either empty (if the answer is 'YES') or a string of length n consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets (if the answer is 'NO').**
