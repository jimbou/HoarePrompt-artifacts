Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of printed values, each representing the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the list equal to the most frequent element. If the maximum frequency of any element is greater than or equal to k, the output is k-1; otherwise, the output is n, the number of elements in the list. The value of t, the number of test cases, remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
