Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in a list equal to the most frequent element. For each test case, it reads two integers (n and k) and a list of n integers, then calculates the frequency of each unique element in the list. If the maximum frequency is greater than or equal to k, it prints k-1; otherwise, it prints n, the number of elements in the list. The function processes all test cases and prints the results accordingly.**
