Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem states that we can perform the operation any number of times, but the program only checks if the maximum count of a number is greater than or equal to k, and if so, it prints k-1. This is not correct because it does not consider the case where we can perform the operation multiple times to reduce the number of cards.

For example, consider the input:

5 3
1 1 1 1 1

The program will print 2, but the correct answer is 1. We can perform the operation twice to reduce the number of cards to 1.

The correct solution should consider the maximum number of times we can perform the operation and calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand.
