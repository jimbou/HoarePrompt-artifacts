Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 100).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The stdin now contains t test cases, each consisting of two lines as described. The values of the other variables are not affected.
