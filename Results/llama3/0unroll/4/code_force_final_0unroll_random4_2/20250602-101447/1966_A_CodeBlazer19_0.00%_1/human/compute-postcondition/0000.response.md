Let's break down the code and its impact on the program.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

In the initial state, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100).

When the code `t = int(input())` is executed, the first integer `t` is read from `stdin` and assigned to the variable `t`. The remaining input in `stdin` is still present, which includes `t` test cases.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100), and the second line contains `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100).**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` now holds an integer value between 1 and 500, and the standard input still contains the remaining test cases, which consist of two lines each, with specific constraints on the values of `n`, `k`, and `c_i`.
