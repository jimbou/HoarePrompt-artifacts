Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then enters a while loop that runs for each test case.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).

3. It initializes a variable `start_year` to 0, which will keep track of the year in which the current sign will occur.

4. The program then enters a for loop that iterates over each sign. For each sign, it calculates the year in which the sign will occur by using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula works as follows:
   - `start_year + 1` gives the year after the previous sign has occurred.
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` gives the number of times the current sign's periodicity fits into the years after the previous sign.
   - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1` gives the number of times the current sign's periodicity fits into the years after the previous sign, plus one. This is because the current sign will occur one more time after the previous sign.
   - `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` gives the year in which the current sign will occur.

5. After calculating the year for each sign, the program prints the year in which the n-th sign will occur.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
