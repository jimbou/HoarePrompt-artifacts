Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the number of signs for each test case.
2. It initializes the `start_year` variable to 0, which is the correct initial value.
3. The program then iterates over the signs, updating the `start_year` variable using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula correctly calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year`.
4. The program prints the final `start_year` value for each test case, which is the year when the apocalypse will happen.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the calculated start year value.

Correctness: **True**
